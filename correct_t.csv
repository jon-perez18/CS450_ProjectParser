0,95a06052b68c5712d187bd826376e31dbe8ced00,"Here we introduce a culture system for the isolation, passaging and amplification of avian tracheal epithelial (ATE) cells. The ATE medium, which contains chicken embryo extract and fetal bovine serum, supports the growth of ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells from chicken tracheas on fibronectin-or matrigel-coated dishes. Non-epithelial cells make up less than 10% of the total population. We further show that ATE cells support the replication and spread of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Interestingly, immunocytostaining revealed that basal cells are resistant to IBV infection. We also demonstrate that glycosaminoglycan had no effect on infection of the cells by IBV. Taken together, these findings suggest that primary ATE cells provide a novel cell culture system for the amplification of IBV and the in vitro characterization of viral cytopathogenesis.
tracheal epithelial cell / infectious bronchitis virus / basal cell / primary culture / glycosaminoglycan","Embryonated egg inoculation is commonly used to amplify avian RNA viruses. Successful viral replication mainly depends upon viral adaption to and replication in the cells of the embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Growth retardation and malformation of the embryo are the main indicators of viral reproduction in this system and signal the proper period for harvesting the amplified virions from the amniotic or chorioallantoic fluids.
The low efficiency of viral amplification may prevent etiology determinations, intensive surveillance of epidemiology and the tracing of potential natural domestic hosts for viral pathogens during an outbreak. For instance, avian metapneumovirus (MPV), which primarily attacks the respiratory tract, replicates inefficiently in embryonic eggs. Diagnosis of MPV infection is mainly dependent on the detection of viral RNA or viral antigens, but not viral isolation [5, 6] . In addition, to investigate the epidemiology of avian influenza viruses (AIV) requires efficient and sensitive viral detection and amplification system for comprehensive collection of the viruses from waterfowl and migratory birds [17, 31] . However, the wildbird isolated AIV are usually mildly or nonpathogenic to chicken embryos [20, 26] and the efficiency of viral isolation is often unsatisfactory in embryonated eggs [11, 19] .
It has been shown that serial passage using chicken embryos enforces the selection of adapted viruses and inevitably alters the genetic codes of the primary viral isolates, especially for genes involved in cell adsorption and viral replication [8, 9] . The environment of the viral replication may also selectively modify the original cell tropism and pathogenesis of the isolated virus [15, 25] . It has been shown that a serially embryo-passaged of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) M41 strain exhibited significantly attenuated pathogenesis within the oviduct compared to the parental strain [7] . In addition, egg-mediated epitope alterations in amplified isolates might attenuate the protective efficiency of these viruses when used to vaccinate against the challenge of a wild-type virulent strain [16, 24] . For instance, after egg adaption, human influenza A virus, originally showing a2-6 sialic acid tropism only, exhibits increased hemagglutinin (HA) binding affinity to a2-3 sialic acid-containing gangliosides due to amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the receptor binding site of the HA protein [8, 15] . For primary viral isolates, providing natural host cells for replication might eliminate the selection pressure of an exotic growth environment and avert the alteration of cell tropism and consequent genomic mutations.
Recently, a study reported a primary culture system for tracheal epithelial cells from an embryonic day (E) 17 chick embryo, in which dissociated culture cells exhibited ciliary movement and were positive for the expression of pan-cytokeratin [33] . In addition, the global profile of mRNA expression in the cultured cells showed that cytokeratin 14 (K14), a basal cell marker, was highly expressed. However, the protein expression of cell-type specific markers and the existence of mucin-secreting goblet cell are not well-characterized. In this study, we developed a novel culture system to isolate, amplify and passage chicken tracheal epithelial cells in an efficient manner. The avian tracheal epithelial (ATE) cell types were identified using immunocytostaining, and the ratio of cell types is statistically illustrated. We further demonstrate that primary ATE cells support IBV replication. The susceptible cell types and the effect of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) on IBV attachment to ATE cells was also investigated.
Two IBV, 2575/98 and 2296/95, were isolated in Taiwan and maintained using serial passage through specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs [29] . IBV were inoculated into the embryonic eggs at the E9 stage and harvested at the E11 stage from chorioallantoic fluid. The original viral titers of 2575/98 and 2296/ 95 are 10 7.4 EID 50 /0.1 mL and that of 2296 reached 10 9.6 /0.1 mL, respectively [14] . The applied viral titer of both IBV was 1 · 10 5 EID 50 /mL.
Plaque-purified Taiwan-isolated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strain RP-9 [28] was used as a positive control for the study of GAG effect on the virus-cell attachment. The adsorption of JEV was performed with serum-free RPMI medium at 37°C for 1 h. Virus-infected cells were incubated in RPMI containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Virus titers were determined by plaque assay in BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) cells, which were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 5% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 mg/mL of streptomycin, and 100 IU/mL of penicillin. The medium and culture reagents are obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Tracheas were obtained from one-day-old SPF chicks and rinsed in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) under sterile conditions. After the removal of surrounding adipose and muscular tissues, tracheas were digested with dispase I solution (2.5 U/mL dispase I) (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA) for 2 h at 37°C to disrupt the basal membrane. Forceps were used to force the outflow of detached cell sheets of tracheal epithelium from the tracheal lumen. The epithelial cells were harvested and further digested with collagenase I (1 mg/mL, Roche) for 5 min at 37°C. The cells were gently pipetted, and the tissues were homogenized into small cell clumps. FBS was added to the digesting solution to stop the reaction. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min to remove residual digesting enzymes. The cell pellets were resuspended in ATE medium, containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 10% chicken embryo extract (CEE) (US Biological, Swampscott, MA, USA; or self-made [27] ), 1% glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in DMEM-F12 medium (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded on 2% matrigel-or 20 lg/mL fibronectin-coated 24-well or 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). When the cells reached confluence, the cultured cells were passaged by digestion with both 0.01% (w/vol) protease (type XIV, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5 U/mL dispase I for 5 min at 37°C.
GAG compounds, including the heparin (H), heparan sulfate (HS), dextran sulfate (DS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay kit was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. FITC-conjugated BSI-B4 isolectin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a marker for basal cells from the tracheal epithelium [12] . Commercial culture media for human and rat airway epithelial cells were obtained from CELLnTEC advanced cell system (Postfach, Bern, Switzerland) and CELL Applications Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA), respectively.
Cells or cryosections of infected trachea were fixed in 4% cold paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X 100. Immunocytochemistry was performed with the following primary antibodies: E-cadherin (1:500, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), b-tubulin IV and pan b-tubulin (1:100, Sigma), ZO-1 (1:100, Zymed-Invitrogen), mucin 5AC (1:50, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), cytokeratin 14 (1:100, Convance, Princeton, NJ, USA), smooth muscle actin (SMA, 1:50, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and vimentin (1:500, Convance). Immune-serum of IBV-infected chicken, screened by ELISA, was used for the detection of IBV antigens in infected cells (1:200) [30] . Fixed cells were washed twice with 0.1% Tween-20 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Appropriate fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) were used for visualization. Blue 4 0 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used for nuclear counter-staining. Images of immunostaining were captured using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE 80I) or confocal microscope (LSM510 Meta, Zeiss).
Total RNA was extracted from TW2575/98infected ATE cells using TRIzol TM C&T (Protech, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Positive-sense and negative-sense viral RNA (0.5 lg) were reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript TM III reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen) with oligo dT and sense primer 5 0 -ACT GAA AAT GAT AGT GTT ATG-3 0 , respectively. PCR was performed with a proofreading DNA polymerase (KOD-Plus, Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The PCR cycling conditions consisted of 28 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 1 min on a PCR machine (ASTEC 818). The primer sequences for detection of the nucleocapsid gene of IBV were 5 0 -AAT GCA TCT TGG TTT CAA GC-3 0 and 5 0 -TCC TCA TCT GAG GTC AAT GC-3 0 ; for detection of GAPDH, the sequences were 5 0 -GTG AAG GTC GGT GTG AAC G3 0 and 5 0 -GGT GAA GAC ACC AGT AGA CAC TC-3 0 .
The effect of GAG on JEV and IBV infections was measured in BHK-21 cells and ATE cells, respectively. The cells were seeded at a density of 5 · 10 3 cells/well in 96-well plates. The GAG were serially diluted and applied at 0, 7.5, 15, and 30 lg/mL for BHK-21 cells and at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/mL for ATE cells. The BHK-21 and ATE cells were infected with 500 plaque-forming units of JEV and 10 3 EID 50 of IBV at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with serum-free medium, and then normal growth medium was added. The number of infected cells per 96-well, revealed by IBV immunocytostaining, was manually counted at 8 h post-infection (h.p.i.) from five individual fields. No obvious cell damage was observed after GAG treatment or viral infection at 8 h.p.i. [18, 28] .
For the isolation of tracheal epithelial cells, the intact cell sheet of the tracheal epithelium was first isolated from dispase-treated tracheas (Fig. 1A) . The epithelial membrane sheet was further mechanically disrupted into small pieces by pipetting. Floating unattached ATE cells rapidly underwent cell death or growth arrest after a one-day culture. The optimal cell matrix for ATE cells was evaluated; both 2% matrigel or 20 lg/mL fibronectin efficiently promoted cell attachment, but gelatin, collagen I, collagen IV and laminin were less effective (data not shown). The primary culture system for mammalian tracheal epithelial cells is well-established. To culture the ATE cells, specialized commercial media for the tracheal epithelia of humans and rats were first tested (described in the Materials and methods section). None of them supported cell growth or long-term viability of ATE cells. Adjustment of the concentration of retinoic acid, a differentiating factor for tracheal epithelial cells [10] , did not affect attachment or cell growth of ATE cells. Increasing FBS from 10% to 20% in the culture medium modestly enhanced the viability of the cells (data not shown). We speculated that unidentified chicken nutrients essential for the promotion of ATE cell growth were absent in the culture medium. CEE, an essential supplement for the culture of mouse neural crest stem cells [27] , was added to DMEM-F12 medium with 10% FBS. We found that CEE significantly improved cell growth and reduced cell death of the primary ATE cells (Figs. 1B and 1C) . The cell number of initial harvest from one trachea on day 1 is about 2 · 10 5 cells. With this optimized culture medium, isolated cells displayed increased MTT activity, and the celldoubling time was 46 h during the first 6 days of culture (Fig. 1D) . The ATE cells could sustain proliferative activity for 3-5 passages. These results show that the established culture system provides sufficient nutrients and proper 
Tracheal epithelial cells are connected to each other by E-cadherin molecules [23] . Among the isolated ATE cells, 88.3 ± 13.2% expressed E-cadherin and a gap-junction molecule, ZO-1 [23] . E-cadherin-negative cells, including SMA-positive muscle cells and vimentin-positive fibroblast cells, accounted for 5.0 ± 1.4% and 3.5 ± 1.2% of the cultured cells, respectively, indicating the high purity of this primary culture system. In tracheal epithelial cells, b-tubulin IV/b-tubulin, mucin 5AC and cytokeratin 14 (K14) are specific markers of ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells, respectively [12, 13, 23] . Basal cells also show high affinity for GSI-B4, a plant lectin that specifically binds the glycoconjugates of basal cells of tracheal epithelia [12, 13] . Figure 2 shows that these three major cell types -ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells -were all present in the ATE population, and accounted for 22.8 ± 9.1%, 44.8 ± 9.7% and 41.6 ± 8.4% of the ATE cells, respectively.
To determine whether ATE cells support the replication of IBV, two egg-adapted Taiwan IBV strains, 2575/98 and 2296/95, were used in this study. These two IBV viruses cannot infect primary chicken embryonic fibroblast cells or immortalized DF1 chicken fibroblast cells. The ATE cells (5 · 10 4 ) were infected with 50 lL 2575/98 (EID 50 = 10 5 /mL) for 1 h at 37°C. At 24 h.p.i., IBV proteins were detected in 2 500-3 000 cells by staining with chicken anti-serum against IBV (Fig. 3B) . We found that the IBV only infected N-cadherin + tracheal epithelial cells, revealing that neither smooth muscle cells nor fibroblast cells are the major target cells for IBV infection (Figs.  3D and 3E) . The infection rate gradually increased to 55.3 ± 12.8% of the total cells at 72 h.p.i. (Fig. 3C) , as estimated by immunocytostaining for IBV antigens in all adherent cells. Similar results were observed in 2296/95-infected cells (data not shown). In addition, both positive-and negative-sense viral RNA present were detected in the cytosol, and positive-sense viral RNA could be detected in the supernatant of ATE cells at 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 3F) , demonstrating that mature IBV virion could be produced and released from the cells. These results indicate that cultured ATE cells support viral infection, replication and spreading of IBV.
It has been reported that IBV can infect both ciliated cells and goblet cells in the tracheal epithelium [1, 22] . However, whether basal cells are also susceptible to IBV infection remains obscure. We infected isolated intact tracheas with 50 lL 2575/98 (EID 50 = 10 5 /mL) for 48 h and found that IBV protein expression only colocalized with b-tubulin IV-or mucin 5AC-positive cells (Figs. 4A and 4B) . No viral protein was detected in the K14-positive basal cells of the tracheal epithelium (Figs. 4C and 4D). To further examine whether basal cells are resistant to IBV infection in vitro, 5 · 10 4 ATE cells were also infected with 50 lL of IBV 2575/98 strain (10 5 EID 50 /mL) for 48 h. In vitro results consistently showed that viral proteins of IBV were mainly detected in ciliated cells and goblet cells, but not in basal cells (Figs. 4E-4H). Similar cell tropism results were obtained when IBV 2296/95 or a higher dosage of viral loading was used (data not shown). These in vivo and in vitro experiments clearly delineate the cell tropism of IBV in the avian respiratory tract.
Virus binding to host cell surface receptors is critical for determining tissue tropism and viral pathogenesis. It has been shown that H or HS may serve as a coreceptor in fibroblast cells for infection by the IBV Beaudette strain, but not the M41 strain [18] . In this study, highly sulfated GAG, such as H and DS, and common GAG, such as HS and CS, were tested to determine whether they possess different neutralizing effects on binding of Taiwan-isolated IBV to ATE cells. JEV was used as a positive control for the evaluation of the GAG effect [28] . Figure 5A shows that both H and DS at 7.5 lg/mL effectively blocked JEV infection in BHK-21 cells, as previously reported [28] . Complete inhibition of JEV infection was achieved when the concentrations of H and DS were elevated to 30 lg/mL. Although low concentrations of HS and CS did not affect JEV infection, a modest neutralizing effect was observed when the concentrations of HS and CS were elevated to 30 lg/mL. In contrast to the JEV results, even when all of the tested GAG were applied at 2.0 mg/mL, no significant inhibitory effects were observed on the infection of primary ATE cells by TW2575/98 (Fig. 5B ). In addition, the GAG did not alter the cell tropism of IBV on cilia cells or goblet cells (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the binding affinity of GAG for IBV is too low to interfere with viral entry into tracheal epithelial cells. In this study, we showed that primary ATE cells exhibit the same cell composition as tracheal epithelia and can be passaged and amplified in a convenient and efficient way. These cells support IBV viral replication and viral release, providing an ideal system to amplify respiratory viruses and characterize their pathogenesis.
In studies of tracheal infection, ciliated cells and goblet cells have been shown to be the major target cells of IBV [1, 22] . Our results with primary ATE cells also showed that IBV viral protein can be detected in both ciliated cells and goblet cells. This cell tropism may account for the pathogenesis of IBV, such as the ciliostasis in observed IBV-infected TOC and the reduction of sialic acid secretion [3, 22] . In addition, we are the first to demonstrate that IBV does not appear to infect K14-positive basal cells. In an uncomplicated IBV-infected chick, clinical signs such as gasping, coughing, tracheal rales and nasal discharge persist for only 5-to-7 days and disappear within 2 weeks [3, 22] . In the recovery stage, unaffected basal cells may be responsible for epithelial hyperplasia after desquamation of the ciliated and goblet cells and reconstruction of the epithelium of the injured respiratory tract to reestablish normal physiological functioning [12, 13, 22] . The insensitivity of basal cells to IBV infection also suggests that coinfection with other viral or bacterial pathogens is required to disrupt basal membrane integrity and cause hemorrhage in IBV-infected tracheas. At present, quantification of the virulence of IBV is still a problem [3, 22] . Measuring ciliostasis in TOC is not a sensitive approach for determining the severity of respiratory tract injury caused by IBV infection [21] . In addition, different species of chicken may also vary in the vulnerability of their respiratory tissue to IBV infection [2, 22] . In our ATE system, IBV shows high affinity for ciliated cells and goblet cells. Cell tropism, viral replication and viral spread can be determined and quantified by immunocytostaining, suggesting that ATE cells could serve as a quantitative platform to determine the pathogenesis of IBV. It has been shown that sialic acid and HS may help IBV bind to its receptor on the cell membrane of target cells [18, 32] . Receptor binding triggers endocytosis and delivers the viral genome into the cytosol through pHdependent membrane fusion [4] . In this study, we demonstrate that none of the tested GAG interfered with IBV binding to ATE cells. Further investigation is required to test whether this ineffectiveness is due to a lack of the XBBXBX H consensus sequence in the S protein sequences of TW IBV.
In this study, we established a primary ATE cell culture system for the maintenance and amplification of epithelial cells of the chicken respiratory tract. Using these culture conditions, immortalized cell lines could potentially be established by overexpression of oncogenes, telomerase or anti-apoptotic genes. Both primary cells and respiratory cell lines will provide a new window to reveal viral life cycles, viral persistence, virus-cell interaction and the pathogenesis of avian respiratory viruses.",The infection of primary avian tracheal epithelial cells with infectious bronchitis virus,"Shen, Ching-I; Wang, Ching-Ho; Liao, Jiunn-Wang; Hsu, Tien-Wang; Kuo, Shu-Ming; Su, Hong-Lin",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769550/,144,3126,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,9b49622e8c16b0e941616d09e9ccdcfbc5d5ff0c,"While nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (NST) has shown efficacy against several solid tumors, it is untested in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). In a phase II clinical trial, 21 patients with pretreated metastatic NPC underwent NST with sibling PBSC allografts, using CY conditioning, thymic irradiation and in vivo T-cell depletion with thymoglobulin. Stable lymphohematopoietic chimerism was achieved in most patients and prophylactic CYA was tapered at a median of day þ 30. Seven patients (33%) showed partial response and three (14%) achieved stable disease. Four patients were alive at 2 years and three showed prolonged disease control of 344, 525 and 550 days. With a median follow-up of 209 (4-1147) days, the median PFS was 100 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 66-128 days), and median OS was 209 days (95% CI, 128-236 days). Patients with chronic GVHD had better survival-median OS 426 days (95% CI, 194-NE days) vs 143 days (95% CI, 114-226 days) (P ¼ 0.010). Thus, NST may induce meaningful clinical responses in patients with advanced NPC.","Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in southern China and Southeast Asia and long-term survival for patients with advanced NPC remains poor, despite the use of salvage chemotherapy agents. 1-3 Molecular targeted therapies have not yet achieved significant benefit against NPC. Thus, novel approaches are urgently needed. Because NPC in Asia is almost universally associated with EBV, and viral oncoproteins (EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2) are expressed by tumor cells, immunotherapy represents a promising therapeutic strategy. [4] [5] [6] Studies using adoptively transferred EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in NPC have shown clinical responses in patients; [7] [8] [9] however, their overall efficacy is modest, especially in patients with metastatic and/or bulky disease.
Nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (NST) may present another immunotherapeutic approach for patients with advanced stage NPC. Through a potent graft-vs-tumor (GVT) effect, 10 NST has shown some efficacy against a range of solid tumors including renal cell, breast and colon cancers. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Its role in NPC, however, has not yet been evaluated.
To evaluate the role of NST in patients with pretreated metastatic NPC, we conducted a prospective phase II study. We used an NST regimen modified from Spitzer et al., 18 using the comparably more lymphodepleting rabbit antithymocyte globulin, thymoglobulin, aiming to induce stable mixed chimerism, before final conversion to a full donor lymphohematopoietic chimera. Single agent CYA was tapered rapidly in our protocol and donor lymphocyte infusions were used as needed.
Although patients in our study were heavily pretreated, we achieved a reasonable response rate with NST, and several patients had durable disease control.
Patients o70 years and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) of p2, metastatic NPC who had received at least one line of salvage chemotherapy were eligible. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of o45%, active angina pectoris, uncontrolled arrhythmia, hypertension, severe chronic or restrictive lung disease, or corrected diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of p50%, creatinine clearance of o50 mL/min, serum bilirubin of 42 mg/100 mL or ALT or AST 43 Â the upper limit of normal were excluded, as were patients with active uncontrolled infection, active central nervous system disease, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B or C positive serology. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the National Cancer Centre of Singapore.
In dedicated HEPA-filtered BMT rooms, patients received a conditioning regimen of i.v. CY 50 mg/kg/day from day À5 to À3, a single fraction of 7 Gy thymic irradiation (unless there had been previous mediastinal radiation) on day À1, in vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (thymoglobulin; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA), at 2.5 mg/kg/day initially on day À1, þ 1, þ 3 and þ 5 (regimen 1). This schedule was later modified to day À1, þ 1, þ 2 and þ 3 (regimen 2) because of secondary graft loss in patients receiving regimen 1.
Patients received unmanipulated allogeneic PBSC grafts from their HLA-identical or single Ag-mismatch sibling donor. Donor PBMC were collected by leukapheresis and donor leukocyte infusion (DLIs) were considered at least 14 days after complete prophylactic CYA taper provided there was no acute GVHD and/or if the donor T-cell chimerism was not increasing. After the first DLI, at a dose of 1 Â 10 7 per kg CD3 þ T cells, subsequent DLI was considered monthly at incrementally increasing doses. Donor chimerism was analyzed weekly using semiquantitative PCR analysis, until full donor chimerism (495% of donor cells in the mononuclear cell population) was achieved.
All patients received GVHD prophylaxis of CYA (Neoral; Novartis, Singapore) starting at 5 mg/kg/day i.v. divided into two doses from day À1 that was reduced to 3 mg/kg/ day from day þ 4. Once engrafted, patients were converted to daily oral CYA 12 mg/kg, aiming for a therapeutic trough level between 200 and 400 ng/mL. In the absence of acute GVHD, CYA was rapidly tapered.
Prophylactic ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, acyclovir and cotrimoxazole were administered as described previously. 18 For acute GVHD of Xgrade II, methylprednisolone of 2 mg/kg/day was initiated. CMV infection was screened using viral pp65 antigenemia assay weekly after hospital discharge until day þ 100. Pre-emptive i.v. ganciclovir was administered according to institutional practice.
Treatment-related toxicities and GVHD Toxicities were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0) and the severity of acute GVHD according to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry criteria and post-DLI acute and chronic GVHD by the common criteria. 19 Immunophenotyping T-cell subpopulations Peripheral blood was collected from 20 evaluable NPC patients pre-NST and serially up to 1-year post-NST, and from 20 healthy volunteers to serve as normal controls. Immunophenotyping of human T lymphocytes was performed by multicolor flow cytometric analysis by FACS-Calibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) to determine the levels of specific functional T-cell subsets, such as naive, memory/effector T cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. 20 Monitoring cell-free EBV DNA in plasma DNA was extracted from plasma samples collected at monthly intervals. Real-time PCR with EBV-specific probe and primer sets targeted at the Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen region was performed as previously described. 21 
The interval of PFS was calculated from the date of transplantation to the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, or last follow-up; and OS duration from the date of transplantation to the first documentation of death from any cause, or last followup. Duration of response was measured from date of first objective RECIST response to date of disease progression or death, whichever earlier. Time to response was measured from the date of transplantation to the first documentation of response.
Pearson w 2 -test or Fisher's exact test was used to test the association between categorical variables, whereas Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test the difference of continuous variables. Best overall tumor response rate was summarized with 95% confidence interval using the Wilson method. 22 Survival and response curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons between curves were tested by log-rank test.
Between July 2002 and July 2007, 59 advanced NPC patients and their siblings were screened and HLA-typed. Twenty-six patients with histologically confirmed metastatic NPC and available HLA-matched sibling donor allografts (n ¼ 24) or an HLA one-Ag mismatched donor allograft (n ¼ 2) were accrued. Only 21 patients eventually received NST due to rapid progressive disease in 5 patients. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic halted accrual of patients for almost a year.
Median age (n ¼ 21) was 48 (34-57) years, and patients had received a median of two previous chemotherapy regimens (1-8) with a median of four (2-8) chemotherapy agents. All patients had extensive metastases, with a median of four (2-5) organ sites and 17 had previous progressive disease (Table 1) . Seventeen patients (81%) had performance status (PS) of 0-1 and four (19%) had a PS of 2.
The median hospitalization for NST was 25 (12-90) days and the median PBSC dose infused was 5.25 Â 10 6 (2.42-10.18 Â 10 6 ) CD34 þ PBSC per kg. Median time to engraftment was 12 (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) days. Three patients (15%) developed mild engraftment syndrome (pgrade II). Four patients (20%) had secondary engraftment loss, under regimen 1, whereas no patient under regimen 2 experienced graft loss (P ¼ 0.087). One patient on regimen 1 was given i.v. CY before third DLI to augment donor chimerism.
Patients with mixed chimerism who did not have acute GVHD underwent rapid CYA taper. The median time to complete removal of CsA for 19 evaluated patients was on day þ 30 (day þ 16 to þ 42). CYA was subsequently restarted for the treatment of either acute or chronic GVHD in 10 patients, with patients receiving concurrent corticosteroids.
The median level of donor chimerism among patients who had achieved stable mixed chimerism was 50% at day þ 100 and 95% at 6 months post-NST. Sixteen patients received DLIs. The median number of DLIs administered per patient was 2 (1-6), and the mean dose at each administration per patient was 1.53 ± 0.43 Â 10 7 CD3 þ T cells per kg. Immune reconstitution of CD3 þ , CD4 þ and CD8 þ T-cell populations post-NST is outlined in Supplementary Figure 1A and Treg cell data are provided in Supplementary Figure 1B. Patients on study had higher baseline Treg cells (9.41%) compared to normal controls (P ¼ 0.009) though there was no difference in pre-NST CD4 þ Treg numbers between responders and nonresponders.
Transplant mortality and adverse events Two patients died within 100 days of transplant, one of acute GVHD on day þ 91 (patient 5), and one of acute pulmonary embolism on day þ 4 (patient 21). Bacterial infections (grades III, IV and V) constituted the commonest complication, occurring in seven patients (Table 2 ). In most instances, sepsis occurred within 100 days of NST, and was effectively treated with i.v. antibiotics. One patient died from a strongyloides infection on day þ 137 post-NST. One patient developed CMV retinitis and was successfully treated with ganciclovir.
Grade II-IV acute GVHD occurred in five patients (25%), and was controllable with standard immunosuppressive agents in all except in one patient who died on day þ 91, following a second DLI. Chronic GVHD (all limited) was diagnosed in six patients (30%), and only one patient required prolonged CYA treatment. Figure 1a ). Serial evaluation of EBV DNA levels were performed in 11 patients and showed a strong correlation to the observed clinical responses (Supplementary Table 1 ).
At the time of analysis, only one patient was alive. With a median follow-up of 209 (4-1147) days, the estimated median PFS was 100 (95% CI, 66-128) days (Figure 1b ) and the 1-year PFS rate was 5% (s.e., 0.047). Two patients showed prolonged disease control of 344 and 525 days and a third had a second PFS of 550 days. Patient 7, a lady with progressive lung, nodal, and bone metastases pre-NST achieved brief tumor shrinkage post-NST but progressed on day þ 118. Following limited chronic GVHD on day þ 202, she achieved stable disease for approximately 3 months before progressing again. Five DLIs were then administered (Supplementary Figure 2) . Although her disease continued to regress on CT scans, objective PR did not occur until much later on day þ 662. Her response duration was 211 days and the duration of her second PFS was 550 days.
Patient 16 experienced the longest response duration (396 days), even though he had entered the study with an extremely aggressive disease and evidence of impending BM failure. Pre-NST, he was symptomatic with worsening dyspnea and intense bone pain despite NSAID and opioid analgesia. He achieved tumor shrinkage of 34% on day þ 129 when donor chimerism increased from 25 to 87% that correlated with a decreasing EBV DNA titer (Figure 2 ). Upon onset of limited chronic GVHD, his tumor continued to shrink further, and regressed once again when donor chimerism reached 100% (Figure 2b) . One year after NST, he achieved PR and complete resolution of all symptoms with significant improvement in quality of life, and his BM biopsy, that had still been positive at day þ 100, finally showed no detectable NPC.
Patient 19 achieved a chimerism of 60% 6 weeks post-NST but this decreased to 12% by day þ 111. He attained a late PR on day þ 101 with a more than 75% reduction in Table 2 Transplantation-associated adverse events tumor diameter. Chimerism improved from 12 to 62.5%, 18 days after the PR that was related to mild GHVD.
The median OS for patients who underwent NST was 209 (95% CI, 128-236) days, the 1-year OS rate was 29% (s.e., 0.099) and the 2-year OS rate was 19% (s.e., 0.088). Patients with chronic GVHD also had much better survival-median OS was 426 days (95% CI, 194-NE days) vs 143 days (95%CI, 114-226 days) in patients without chronic GVHD (P ¼ 0.010, Figure 2c ). Patients who responded to treatment (PR or stable disease) also had a trend toward better survival than nonresponders; median survival time of 326 (95% CI, 136-782) days against 195 (95% CI, 100-235) days, respectively (univariate P ¼ 0.055). Responders and nonresponders were similar in age, number of disease sites and previous chemotherapy, although pre-NST performance status was poorer in responders.
We report results of the first study exploring NST in advanced NPC. Our results show that NST is feasible, and may induce durable responses in subsets of patients, even in the presence of extensive, bulky disease. In our study, we achieved a response rate of 33% and a clinical benefit of 47%, which compares well with the response rates achieved in second-and third-line chemotherapy against NPC (approximately 11-23%). [1] [2] [3] Our NST regimen was overall well tolerated. The integration of thymoglobulin into the same ATG schedule as the Spitzer regimen 18 (regimen 1) resulted in a high incidence of secondary engraftment loss in 4 out of 10 patients. After we revised to incorporate thymoglobulin earlier into the conditioning timeline (regimen 2), which may have worked better to deplete host than donor T lymphocytes, all 10 evaluable patients achieved stable and full donor lymphohematopoietic chimerism. In our study, engraftment syndrome occurred only in 15% of patients and was mild, requiring no treatment, as compared to 67% in the Boston study 18 in which some patients required high-dose steroids for control of this syndrome.
Although our median PFS was short, PFS may underestimate clinical benefit for several reasons. Patients may experience late responses, which occur only after an initial disease progression-however, because only the first event (progressive disease) is used to construct the Kaplan-Meier graph, it would give the false impression of a lack of benefit. Late responses have been described in earlier NST studies and occur typically 3-6 months post transplant, 23, 24 after conversion to a full donor chimerism, although it may be influenced by factors such as the early withdrawal of immunosuppressants or the use of DLIs. 12 Second, patients on NST may experience more than one response. For example, patient 7 had 2 periods of responses-whereas her first PFS was 127 days, the second PFS was significantly longer at 550 days. Finally, NST through reconstituting the immune system may change the biological and growth characteristics of the disease, and thus OS (which is not reliant on any single time point cutoff) may be a more accurate measure of true benefit.
The median OS in our NST study was 7.4 months, with 1-and 2-year OS rate of 29 and 19%, respectively, which is comparable to the median 7-14 months OS for metastatic NPC patients in literature. [1] [2] [3] More importantly, our subgroup analysis indicates that chronic GVHD significantly predicted for both response and OS. This raises questions regarding the role of mHA in mediating the GVT effect, which could be exploited further as an antitumor strategy. 14, 25, 26 Despite early prophylactic CYA taper, GVHD incidence in our study was acceptable, largely due to the high percentage of patients who achieved mixed chimerism by day þ 100. Still, infections were more commonly observed in our study as compared with other NST studies. [11] [12] [13] This may be related to xerostomia, poor dentition, chronic sinusitis and altered mucosal barriers in our NPC patients, most of whom had previous radiotherapy for primary disease. Future NST studies should consider such local immunosuppressive features when selecting patients for NST.
In summary, our study shows that our thymoglobulinbased NST can induce durable responses in NPC patients and overall allow for early taper of prophylactic CYA with acceptable GVHD rates and evidence of GVT. However regimen-related toxicities require careful patient selection. In the study of NST in Hodgkin's disease, an EBV-related tumor, better outcomes were achieved in patients with induced remission before NST. 27 It is therefore likely that better outcomes may have been achievable if NST were to be performed in metastatic NPC patients who show response to induction chemotherapy.

2,058b7249ce7acc1c14c989cb2d8db27435f81363,Citation Fouchier RAM. 2015. Studies on influenza virus transmission between ferrets: the public health risks revisited. mBio 6(1):e02560-14.,"L ipsitch and Inglesby recently estimated the potential public health risks associated with research on influenza virus transmission via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets, leading them to conclude that such research is too risky to be conducted (1) . The authors of that and other publications (2) (3) (4) estimated the probability of laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) and onward transmission of the viruses under investigation, as well as the potential consequence to public health if such events were to occur. Given the weight assigned to these risk estimates, it is important that potential pitfalls in the underlying assumptions in these analyses be rigorously scrutinized. Importantly, the published estimates were based on historical data and did not take into account the numerous risk reduction measures that are in place in the laboratories where the research is conducted. Here, I provide a critical appraisal of the published work, discussing, challenging, and modifying the estimates based on the specific conditions under which the work is performed and the properties of the viruses under investigation. By doing so, the outcome of the risk assessment changes from serious risks to negligible risks for humans and the environment. As a consequence, a more balanced debate about the research on influenza virus transmission via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets is warranted, in particular given the substantial public health benefits assigned to this type of research (5, 6) .
Initial calculations of the potential risks associated with research on influenza virus transmission via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets (1-4) used reports on select agent theft, loss, and release collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2004 to 2010 (7) to calculate the probability of occurrence of LAIs. Although these reports have limitations (1, 4, 7) , they provide the most recent account of LAIs in the United States and probably reflect the current state of the art in biosafety and biosecurity practices better than older studies on laboratory incidents (8, 9) , e.g., as a consequence of the implementation of the U.S. select agent program and best practices developed in biosafety and biosecurity in general over the last decades. From 2004 to 2010, 11 LAIs in total were reported to the U.S. CDC, 4 of which occurred in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities. During this 7-year period, on average 10,000 individuals per year had access to select agents in an average of 292 laboratories per year, thus totaling 2,044 laboratory-years and 70,000 personyears of follow-up (7) . From these data, the probability of occurrence of LAIs under BSL3 conditions was calculated as 4/2,044 (or 2 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 ) per laboratory-year, or 4/70,000 (or 5.7 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 ) per person-year (1) (2) (3) (4) . These estimates, however, do not take into account specific pathogen types or research settings. This is crucial, because working practices in, e.g., virology and microbiology laboratories are different and because each biosafety laboratory is unique (10, 11) . Research facilities and the experiments that are conducted are therefore appraised through targeted risk assessments, in which the planned studies are scrutinized before any experiment is started. On this note, it is important that none of the LAIs reported to the U.S. CDC from 2004 to 2010 involved viruses (7) , and the risks of LAIs associated with work on viral pathogens should thus be estimated as less than 1 per 2,044 (Ͻ5 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 per laboratory-year), or less than 1 per 70,000 (Ͻ1.4 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 per person-year). Unfortunately, the report by Henkel et al. (7) does not specify how many of the 2,044 laboratory-years and 70,000 person-years were related to BSL3 facilities versus BSL2 and BSL4 facilities. Thus, using 2,044 and 70,000 as the denominators yields an underestimation of the true probability of LAIs under BSL3 conditions, as discussed previously (1, 4) .
Research on influenza virus transmission via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets is performed in facilities and under conditions that are specifically designed for the purpose of such studies (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . In ordinary BSL3 laboratories, including diagnostic laboratories, work is performed in open-front class 2 biosafety cabinets with directional airflow, aimed at protecting the environment from release of pathogens and protecting laboratory workers from exposure. Contrary to ordinary BSL3 conditions for work with viruses, all in vivo and in vitro experimental work on influenza virus transmission in the Erasmus MC facility is carried out in class 3 isolators or class 3 biosafety cabinets, which are airtight boxes with negative pressure (ϽϪ200 Pa), to ensure inward flow in case of leakage (12, 16) . Handling is done through airtight gloves fitted to the front of these cabinets. Air released from the class 3 units is filtered by high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and then leaves directly via the facility ventilation system, again via HEPA filters. Only authorized and experienced personnel that have received extensive training can access the facility. For animal handling, personnel always work in pairs to reduce the chance of human error. Although the laboratory is considered ""clean"" because all experiments are conducted in closed class 3 cabinets and isolators, special personal protective equipment, including laboratory suits, gloves, and FFP3 (class 3 filtering face piece) facemasks, are used, and all personnel are vaccinated with the homologous A/H5N1 vaccine. All equipment in the fa-cilities is monitored electronically, and alarm systems are employed to ensure that workers do not enter the facilities if equipment is malfunctioning. All personnel have been instructed and trained how to act in case of incidents, which are handled upon consultation between a senior staff member, a clinical microbiologist, the institutional biosafety officers, and the facility management. Antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) are used immediately in the event that an incident should occur. Every incident in the laboratory is followed up by actions to prevent such incidents from happening again. The facilities, personnel, and procedures are inspected by the U.S. CDC every 3 years, in agreement with the U.S. select agent regulations for overseas laboratories and by the Dutch government (Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport [ILT] inspection) (12, 16) .
The biosafety conditions in the Erasmus MC facility thus extend well beyond ""normal"" BSL3 conditions for working with viruses, and a number of these biosafety measures should be considered when the probability of LAIs is inferred from the U.S. CDC report. Unfortunately, an exact number for the effectiveness of individual biosafety measures is not available (9) . However, it is reasonable to assume that the effectiveness of the physical separation of personnel from the viruses they work with through the use of class 3 isolator units and class 3 biosafety cabinets, the use of personnel protective equipment, the extensive training program, the use of experienced personnel only, and the application of a two-person rule to reduce human error during animal experiments would yield a decrease in the probability of LAIs. Although the magnitude of this increase in safety is not known, I assume that it is at least a factor of 10. Using the risk analysis done by others and this assumption of reduced risk, the probability of a LAI in the Erasmus MC facility would be reduced to below 0.1 ϫ (1.4 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 ), or Ͻ1.4 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 per person-year. The quantitative risk assessment to be performed upon request of the U.S. government (17) will have the challenging task of a better quantitative assessment of the effectiveness for each of the biosafety measures in individual laboratories, to yield exact numbers instead of the conservative estimates used here.
The vaccination of laboratory personnel against the homologous A/H5N1 virus under investigation produces another layer of safety that results in further risk mitigation. Given the generally accepted efficacy of influenza vaccine of~65% for laboratoryconfirmed influenza in healthy adults (18) , vaccination reduces the probability of an LAI that results in viral escape to below 0.35 ϫ (1.4 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 ), or Ͻ5 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 per person-year. The 65% value is almost certainly an underestimate, because this number is taken from general population studies that include individuals with impaired immunity and nonexact matches between the vaccine antigen and the circulating viruses. It is important to note that the antibody titers in our vaccinated laboratory workers are high (geometric mean titer, 987; range, 160 to 10,240) compared to the titers generally accepted as protective against seasonal influenza (Ն40) (19) and that individuals are revaccinated if and when their antibody titers decrease (12) .
As a consequence of the monitoring of equipment both electronically and by visual inspection, potential exposures to virus are unlikely to go unnoticed. Upon any potential exposures, personnel receive oseltamivir treatment upon consultation with various specialists as indicated above. Such early treatment with drugs has been reported to have~80% efficacy against human influenza virus infection (20) and avian influenza virus infection (21) . Here, it is important to note that viruses under study in the Erasmus MC facility are evaluated for their sensitivity to oseltamivir (12) . The immediate treatment of laboratory personnel with oseltamivir upon any potential exposure to virus is thus expected to reduce the probability of LAI further, to below 0.2 ϫ (5 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 ), or Ͻ1ϫ 10 Ϫ 7 per person-year, given the average 80% efficacy in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza.
From this analysis, the conservative estimate is that when research is performed on transmission of influenza viruses via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets in the Erasmus MC facility, to which 10 persons have access, 1 LAI would be expected to occur less frequently than once every 1 million years.
The second factor in the equation of the previous risk assessments is the probability of onward transmission from each case of LAI. Previous studies used 5 to 60% as the probability of onward transmission (1, 2), which is based on the unlimited spread of a pandemic influenza virus in the general population. It is important to note that onward transmission from LAIs has so far been uncommon (7) (8) (9) . In the case of research on influenza virus transmission via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets, a substantial, scientifically justified reduction from the probability of 0.05 to 0.6 of onward transmission from an LAI can be made, based on the above-mentioned biosafety measures and risk mitigation strategies that are in place (12) .
The first factor that needs to be considered is that laboratory personnel that acquired the LAI were vaccinated against the homologous A/H5N1 virus and treated with oseltamivir upon any incident with potential exposure to the virus. Although the vaccination and treatment may have been insufficient to prevent infection altogether (hence the occurrence of the LAI at a frequency of less than once every 1 million years), the virus shedding in H5vaccinated and oseltamivir-treated individuals is likely to be reduced substantially, compared to the onward transmission in times of spread during an influenza pandemic from untreated immunologically naive individuals. If we assume a conservative 2-log reduction in virus excretion in immunized and treated individuals (20-24) compared to untreated immunologically naive individuals, the range of probability of onward transmission from a case of LAI would be reduced to Ͻ5 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 to 6 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 .
As an important risk mitigation strategy to reduce onward transmission upon any potential LAI, Erasmus MC policy dictates enforcement of quarantine of any laboratory personnel that are potentially virus exposed. This policy would reduce the exposure of nonlaboratory personnel to one (the partner of the laboratory worker) or nil, rather than the~100 contacts human adults would ordinarily have during a 5-day time frame (25) . As a consequence, the transmission probability can be further reduced~100-fold, yielding a probability of onward transmission from the case of LAI of Ͻ5 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 to 6 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 .
A final factor to consider in the calculation of the probability of onward transmission from each case of LAI is the basic reproduction number (R0) of the influenza virus under investigation. As indicated above, the previous risk assessments were based on R0 of pandemic influenza virus. However, laboratory experiments have shown that the efficiency of transmission of the laboratoryderived influenza viruses was lower than that of the transmission of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses in ferrets, as could be Letter to the Editor expected (12, 16, 26) . Moreover, given that the viruses are ferret adapted rather than human adapted, even an extremely conservative adjustment of the transmissibility parameter by a factor of 2 would yield a ""final"" estimation of the probability of onward transmission from a case of LAI of Ͻ2.5 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 to 3 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 .
Multiplying the probability of occurrence of an LAI by the probability of onward transmission from each case of LAI, one can estimate that the probability of an LAI resulting in onward transmission would range between (1 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 ) ϫ (2.5 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 ) (or 2.5 ϫ 10 Ϫ13 ) and (1 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 ) ϫ (3 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 ) (or 3 ϫ 10 Ϫ12 ). From this analysis, the estimate is that when research is performed on transmission of influenza viruses via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets in the Erasmus MC facility, to which 10 persons have access, 1 LAI with onward transmission would be expected to occur far less frequently than once every 33 billion years. This probability could be assigned the term ""negligible,"" given that the age of our planet is only 5 billion years.
In previous work (1) (2) (3) (4) , it was assumed that if a ferret-adapted avian influenza virus caused an LAI and onward transmission, it could cause a pandemic with an attack rate of 24 to 38%, as deduced from previous pandemics, and a case fatality rate ranging from 1 to 60% in a population of 7 billion people, thus leading to millions of, or more than a billion, fatalities. However, I consider an attack rate and case fatality rate of this magnitude to be unrealistic. Given that the avian influenza viruses under investigation are ferret adapted rather than human adapted, it is unlikely that these viruses would spread as efficiently between humans. Of note, this does not mean that the ferret model is therefore useless for studies to increase our fundamental knowledge about airborne virus transmission; it simply means that-just like when the mouse model is used to address fundamentals in immunology-we need to carefully validate any results obtained in animals before extrapolation to humans. Throughout the history of virology, scientists have adapted viruses to cells, chicken embryos, or animal species in order to yield viruses that have increased replication properties in these specific hosts or cells but at the same time lose replication capacity and virulence in others (27) . Examples are the passaging of vaccinia virus in chicken embryo fibroblasts to yield modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which is now in use as a safe vaccine vector (28) , the passaging of measles virus, mumps virus, and rubella virus in various cells to yield the live-attenuated MMR vaccine (29) , and the passaging of influenza viruses in mice, ferrets, and eggs to yield the vaccine strain A/PR/ 8/34 (30) , all of which are highly attenuated in humans.
The higher bound of the range of case fatality rates of 60% stems from the number of deaths recorded among laboratoryconfirmed cases of A/H5N1 influenza reported to the WHO (31). Since mild cases of infection-those individuals that do not consult a physician or remain untested-are not recorded, the true case fatality rate of A/H5N1 virus infections in humans is unknown. Due to intrinsic difficulties associated with serology data to estimate the numbers of previously infected individuals, there is no consensus on the incidence of A/H5N1 infections in Southeast Asia (32, 33) , but case fatality rates orders of magnitude lower than 60% have been inferred (27) . In addition, it is important to note that fatalities in ferrets infected with A/H5N1 virus via respiratory droplets or aerosols have not occurred, contrary to when ferrets received large dosages of A/H5N1 virus directly in the (lower) airways (12, 13, 16) .
On the topic of intentional or accidental releases of viruses from laboratories involved in influenza virus transmission studies, it is important to note that during a decade of transmission studies on pandemic and epidemic strains derived from the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 pandemics and on various wild-type and laboratoryadapted zoonotic viruses of subtypes H1, H2, H5, H7, and H9 (summarized in reference 16), no LAIs have been recorded. There have also been no recorded intentional or accidental releases during more than a century of research with human and animal influenza viruses, including highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, even at times when biocontainment measures were largely nonexistent. Some have argued that the 1977 Russian influenza epidemic was the result of a laboratory accident (2) , but in 1977, influenza research was done under conditions of limited biocontainment, and attenuated and wild type strains were tested in humans. We do not know what happened in 1977, but we cannot conclude that the virus escaped a BSL3(ϩ) laboratory.
Since natural influenza pandemics have occurred on average every 30 years over the last century, the probability that the next pandemic will emerge in nature is orders of magnitude larger than emergence from a laboratory. Given the recently summarized immediate and short-term benefits of research on influenza viruses that are transmitted via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets (5, 6) and the longer-term aims to fully understand and predict and prevent pandemics, combined with the extremely low risk to humans and the environment associated with properly conducted experiments, I conclude that it is sensible and acceptable to restart the research, provided that any laboratory participating in this research adopt biosafety and biosecurity conditions comparable to those that are currently in place (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) .

3,d93f7790f05612e0984dba1bf0e720d2771ac304,"Aims: To better inform medical practitioners on the role of antiseptics in oropharyngeal health and disease, this article focuses on povidone-iodine (PVP-I), an established and widely-available antiseptic agent. Methodology: Review of the anti-infective profile, efficacy and safety of PVP-I in managing common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and tonsillo-pharyngitis, as well as oral complications resulting from cancer treatment (oral mucositis), and dental conditions (periodontitis, caries). Results: Antiseptics with broad-spectrum anti-infective activity and low resistance potential offer an attractive option in both infection control and prevention. While there is some evidence of benefit of antiseptics in a variety of clinical settings that include dental and oral hygiene, dermatology, oncology, and pulmonology, there appears to be discordance between the evidence-base and practice. This is especially apparent in the management and prevention of oropharyngeal infections, for which the use of antiseptics varies considerably between clinical practices, and is in marked contrast to their dermal application, where they are extensively used as both a prophylaxis and a treatment of skin and wound infections, thus minimising the use of antibiotics. Conclusion: The link between oral and oropharyngeal health status and susceptibility to infection has long been recognised. The high rates of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of bacterial resistance (e.g. increasing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) in large parts of the world, especially across Asia Pacific, highlight the need for identifying alternative antimicrobials that would minimise the use of these medications. This, together with recent large-scale outbreaks of, for example, avian and swine influenza virus, further underline the importance of an increasing armamentarium for infection prevention and control.
Data were collected through PubMed using specified search criteria based on efficacy, safety and microbicidal activity of PVP-I. Other health-based search engines that included the Cochrane Library were also used to search for reviews on antiseptic use in defined clinical settings. General searches using Google for non-English articles on PVP-I were also conducted. Expert opinion was sought in areas of limited published information such as optimal duration of PVP-I treatment.
While the current evidence-base for antiseptic use in the oropharyngeal setting per se is limited compared with other settings, studies of PVP-I demonstrated effectiveness against a broad spectrum of common mouth and throat pathogens and minimised the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, certain dental conditions, and severity of cancer therapy-associated oral complications. Use of PVP-I may thereby assist in the rationalisation of antibiotic prescription.
ª","The status of the oral and oropharyngeal cavities, which includes the mouth and throat, is inextricably linked to the general health and well-being of an individual (1) . Colonisation by pathogenic micro-organisms or an imbalance of the physiological microbiome in the oral cavity can play an essential role in the development and perpetuation of disease (2, 3) . Indeed, viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa can give rise to many common oral and oropharyngeal conditions, as diverse as dental caries, periodontal disease, gingivitis, as well as upper respiratory tract infections such as sore throat, common cold and influenza (2) . In the hospital setting, colonisation of pathogens in the oropharyngeal region can result in more serious sequelae in intubated patients, where their spread into the lower respiratory tract can result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (4) . This underscores the importance of exercising good mouth and throat hygiene as a means of minimising risk in the development of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections.
Oral complications are known to develop in cancer patients, either as a direct consequence of the malignancy or because of side effects of therapy (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Appropriate and timely oral care measures have been shown to minimise the severity of complications and improve patient quality of life (10, 11) . Consequently, several clinical guidelines and systematic reviews sup-port preventative oral health regimens that include tooth brushing, use of mouthrinses, gargling and professional oral care, as important components to infection control practices (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) .
Antiseptics appear to be suitable candidates as alternative or adjunctive agents to antibiotics to prevent and treat infections based on evidence of their benefit in dental (17) , dermatology (18) , and general oral health settings (19) . Currently, such practices for oropharyngeal conditions are less well established. The objective of this review was to assess the published evidence on the efficacy and safety of the widely known antiseptic, povidone-iodine (polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine, PVP-I), considered an effective first-line option in the prevention and management of skin infections (20) , in common upper respiratory tract infections, oral complications resulting from cancer treatment and in general dental conditions.
Search methods included electronic databases such as PubMed, library catalogues, the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group; as well as Google using a combination of search terms such as: 'antiseptics', 'microbial', 'clinical trials', 'povidone-iodine', 'oral health', 'throat', 'respiratory infections', 'oral mucositis' and 'dental'. The search was not restricted to English language articles.
The mouth and throat of healthy individuals are known to be inhabited by hundreds of diverse bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses that colonise different surfaces of the oral and oropharyngeal cavities (21, 22) . These micro-organisms may associate to form biofilms, which are resistant to antibiotic treatment. While many micro-organisms can be protective, an ecological shift because of an environmental trigger can initiate a cascade of events that leads to pathogenic changes and ensuing disease (23) . Indeed, the transition from an asymptomatic 'healthy' carrier to invasive disease is reflected by a change in the microbial flora (24) . The exact mechanism of this change is unclear, although poor oral hygiene, a compromised immune response and genetics are thought to play a part (23) . Interestingly, inflammation, the body's defence against injury or infection, has itself been proposed as a mechanism for propagating infection by promoting the growth of dysbiotic microbial communities that have evolved to not only withstand but also exploit the otherwise hostile environment (25) .
The oral and oropharyngeal cavities act as reservoirs for a broad variety of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms (Table 1) . This indicates a need for antiseptic agents with broad-spectrum activity, as well as oral formulations that ensure whole oral and oropharyngeal antiseptic coverage.
Povidone-iodine is considered to have the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial action compared with other common antiseptics such as chlorhexidine, octenidine, polyhexanide (20) and hexetidine (26) showing efficacy against Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, bacteria spores, fungi, protozoa and several viruses (20) . Persistency of effect has also been demonstrated in a study that assessed 1% PVP-I as a preprocedural antibacterial agent in individuals with varying degrees of oral hygiene (27) . Reductions in micro-organism concentrations were found to be sustained for at least 4 h (27) . Furthermore, there is some evidence that PVP-I is able to restore the natural microbial flora following bacterial infection, as observed in the setting of bacterial vaginosis (28) . In a prospective, randomised clinical trial in women with bacterial vaginosis, treatment with PVP-I led to rapid re-colonisation of native lactobacilli (28) .
In a study using gargle and mouthwash samples from healthy volunteers, PVP-I was found to elicit stronger bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than benzethonium chloride (BEC) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) (29) . PVP-I has also been shown in vitro to be effective against highly resistant Enterococcus faecium (30) , as well as coagulase-negative Staphylococci (31), strains of Proteus, Serratia and Pseudomonas (32), and various Mycobacteria strains (33) .
Moreover, in a study comparing the bactericidal activities of PVP-I gargle with CHG and cetylpyridinium gargles against isolate and standard strains of Gram-positive (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia), PVP-I was found to elicit rapid killing of all three strains after 30 s of exposure and at all dilutions. In contrast, chlorhexidine (CHG) failed to kill any of the strains at any time-point and at any dilution; and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) was found to be effective only against Gram-negative strains and only after 60 s of exposure (34) . Hexetidine has been shown to have smaller antimicrobial spectra than PVP-I and even CHG (26) , and considered less effective in reducing the burden of dental plaque bacteria than CHG (35) .
In another comparative study, the bactericidal activity of PVP-I and BEC gargles against Bordetella 
Povidone-iodine has been reported as having the highest virucidal activity profile among several antiseptics such as CHG, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), BEC and alkyldiaminoethyl-glycine hydrochloride (AEG) (37) . Using a standardised in vitro approach, PVP-I gargle was found to inactivate a panel of viruses that included adenovirus, mumps, rotavirus, poliovirus (types 1 and 3), coxsackie virus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, rubella, measles, influenza and human immunodeficiency virus. In this study, CHG, BAC, BEC and AEG were ineffective against adenovirus, polio virus and rhinovirus but generally showed activity against the other aforementioned viruses (37) . In a more recent study, PVP-I products, that included gargle and throat spray, demonstrated rapid virucidal activity against both a highly pathogenic (H5N1) and low pathogenic (H5N3, H7N7 and H9N2) strains of avian influenza A viruses, with viral titres falling below the detection limits of the assay with only 10 s of PVP-I incubation (38) . Similarly, these formulations also showed efficacy against a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain, with PVP-I mediating rapid inactivation of the virus (2 min of treatment) (39) . Furthermore, the results of a study confirmed the virucidal efficacy of PVP-I products including PVP-I gargle against swine influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2) (40) .
Povidone-iodine has also shown rapid activity against Candida species in vitro, ranging between 10 and 120 s from contact to kill time (41) . Candida albicans, a major opportunistic pathogen and cause of recurrent oral thrush and oropharyngeal candidiasis, which is a particular problem in HIV/AIDS patients, can require expensive treatment with antifungal medications. PVP-I has been shown to be highly active against this species and its use has been reported to reduce medical costs associated with fungal infections (42) .
Taken together, these data support the in vitro efficacy of PVP-I in eradicating a broad range of pathogenic micro-organisms that are likely to play an aetiological role in the development of common oral infections.
The active moiety, non PVP-bound ('free') iodine is released into solution from the PVP-I complex. PVP itself has no microbicidal activity but rather delivers the free iodine to target cell membranes. It is this free iodine that mediates the basic mechanism of action (oxidation of amino acids and nucleic acids in biological structures), which is difficult, if not impossible, to counteract. This basic mechanism of action leads to strong microbicidal activity expressed by multiple modes of action that include the disruption of microbial metabolic pathways, as well as destabilisation of the structural components of cell membranes, causing irreversible damage to the pathogen. Consumed free iodine is then replaced by PVPbound iodine. The concentration of free iodine is the determining factor of the microbicidal action of PVP-I (43) (44) (45) . PVP-I exposure leads to destruction of cytosolic and nuclear structures in bacteria and damage to the cell wall in fungi (26, 46) . In a study investigating the virucidal activity of different disinfectants, electron micrographs revealed how exposure to iodine led to degeneration of the nucleoproteins of viral particles, which was the main mechanism of action (47) . However, disruption of surface proteins essential for the spread of enveloped viruses has also been noted (48) . In addition to a direct killing action on bacteria, PVP-I also inhibits the release of pathogenic factors such as exotoxins, endotoxins and tissue-destroying enzymes (49) . Furthermore, iodine is a scavenger of free radical oxygen species, contributing to anti-inflammatory properties (50) .
Given the issue of antibiotic resistance, a critical characteristic of an antiseptic is one that has no or low resistance potential (20, 51) . From our extensive review of the literature, there have been no clinical reports of microbial resistance development in response to PVP-I treatment. This is likely due to its action on multiple pathogenic targets (52). In contrast, bacterial resistance to chlorhexidine has been documented (53) . Resistance may result in alteration in bacterial susceptibility, in part, by altering the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and preventing antiseptic adsorption (20) . Genes conferring resistance to chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium compounds have been identified in up to 42% of S. aureus isolates in Europe and Japan (54, 55) ; and while there are reports of cross-resistance between antiseptics, PVP-I has remained unaffected (46, 52) .
Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are one of the most common reasons for presentation to primary practice by adults and children, and are a major cause of mild morbidity (56) . Symptoms range from the common cold, cough, pharyngitis and fever to occasionally more serious complications, and are associated with high societal costs due to loss in productivity, absenteeism from school and medical resources (57) . Most URTIs are caused by viruses, such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza, coxsackievirus, herpes simplex virus, coronavirus and respiratory simplex virus (58) . However, current practices do not often consider the aetiological basis of the URTI, leading to inappropriate antibiotic prescription for URTI that are of viral origin (59) . This is particularly evident in the treatment of pharyngitis or sore throat, where only 5-30% of cases are because of bacterial infections (60) . Inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics further reinforce the importance of identifying alternative anti-infective agents (61) to complement physical and barrier interventions e.g. handwashing and wearing of masks to prevent and interrupt the spread of respiratory pathogens. The first step in the development of URTIs is the adherence and colonisation of the respiratory pathogen to the oropharyngeal mucosa. Assuming oral entry of such pathogens, gargling offers a practical measure for their eradication (62) . Gargling has been strongly advocated for both prevention and treatment of URTIs in Japan, a practice supported by findings from studies that looked at the role of gargling in both healthy individuals and those with frequent or persistent respiratory infections (62) (63) (64) . In these studies, gargling with either water or PVP-I (four times daily), respectively, were found to reduce the incidence of URTIs. Furthermore, in patients experiencing chronic respiratory infections, PVP-I was found to reduce the episodes of infections with P. aeruginosa, S. aureus (including MRSA) and H. influenzae by half (62) . These findings were further corroborated by a non-randomised study in which gargling with diluted PVP-I reduced the incidence of influenza-like illnesses or the common cold and subsequent absenteeism from school and the work place (65) . While the mechanism of gargling in the prevention of respiratory infections requires further investigation, an early study suggests that gargling may lead to the removal of oral/pharyngeal house dust mite protease which has been shown to increase infectivity of the influenza virus (64, 66) . Gargling, intensified by the presence of PVP-I, may therefore play an important role in the prevention or reduction in the incidence of infection through droplet transmission.
Indeed, the benefit of gargling with PVP-I has been noted in Japanese clinical respiratory guidelines that recommend gargling with PVP-I (four times a day) in both inpatients and healthcare workers for the prevention of hospital-acquired pneumonia (67) . PVP-I has also been recommended as a preventative measure against pandemic influenza (68, 69) .
The bactericidal activities of PVP-I gargle were further explored in a study of children attending middle schools in Japan and their effects on absenteeism because of colds or influenza were assessed (34) . The mean reduction rate in bacterial count immediately after gargling with PVP-I was 99.4% vs. 59.7% and 97.0% with CHG and CPC respectively. Furthermore, the more effective reduction in bacteria count with PVP-I correlated with lower absence rates because of cold and influenza compared with the other schools where the use of other gargles were encouraged (34) .
Respiratory infections in the hospital setting such as aspiration pneumonia or VAP are major issues, especially in elderly people and immunocompromised patients and are associated with high rates of mortality (70, 71) . Moreover, individuals with gastrooesophageal reflux disease (10-20%) can develop recurrent or chronic aspiration pneumonia because of aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs (72) . Pneumonia is also common in patients on mechani- cal ventilation resulting from aspiration of salivary bacteria into the lower respiratory tract (73) . In a prospective, randomised study, the efficacy of a PVP-I rinse on the prevalence of VAP in patients with severe head trauma who were expected to need ventilation, was assessed. When compared with those who received saline and control (no rinsing), significantly fewer patients in the PVP-I group (p = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively) developed VAP (74) .
In another randomised study, the efficacy of PVP-I in mechanical and chemical prophylactic oral cleansing in reducing oral respiratory pathogens in patients requiring endotracheal intubation was assessed. Cleaning with PVP-I resulted in significant reductions in microbial counts of S. pneumoniae (p < 0.05) and H. influenzae (p < 0.05) (75) . In a separate study assessing the prophylactic use of PVP-I gargle in reducing the risk of nosocomial pneumonia, PVP-I was found to eradicate both general bacteria and MRSA colonies in the pharynx before intubation and at the tip of the tube after extubation (76) .
These studies provide a strong rationale for the use of PVP-I as an effective oral care measure to reduce the burden of potential pathogens and minimise the risk of infection in both community-acquired and hospital-acquired settings.
Oral mucositis (OM) is a common and debilitating complication of cancer therapy, affecting 80% of patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies (77) , and over 40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy (78) . Significant associations between mucositis and the development of serious clinical outcomes such as pain, infection, impaired nutritional status and weight loss have been observed (79) . Importantly, these symptoms can lead to disruption in cancer therapy (80) . In a retrospective sample of patients with solid tumours or lymphoma who developed chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, episodes of infection were significantly more common during cycles with OM (any grade) than during cycles without OM (68% vs. 36%, respectively), and this was directly proportional to the severity of OM (81) .
The pathogenesis of oral mucositis involves direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct mucosal injury by radiation and chemotherapy interfere with the average 5-to 14-day turnover time of the oral epithelium and induce apoptosis. Indirect stomatotoxic effects that result from the release of inflammatory mediators, loss of protective salivary constituents and therapy-induced neutropenia have been postulated to contribute to the development of oral mucositis and also to promote the emergence of bacteria, fungi and viruses on damaged mucosa (82) .
Several studies have demonstrated that maintenance of good oral hygiene through prophylactic and therapeutic approaches reduces the severity of OM (83) (84) (85) (86) . Oral decontamination may assist in reducing bacteraemia and infection by opportunistic pathogens (87) . The MASCC/ISOO guidelines recommend a combination of toothbrushing, flossing and at least one mouth rinse (88) .
The efficacy of PVP-I preparations on radiationinduced OM have been explored in numerous studies. A reduction in the onset (2.25 weeks vs. 1.5 weeks; p < 0.05), severity (mean grade 1.0 vs. 3.0; p < 0.005) and duration (2.75 weeks vs. 9.25 weeks; p < 0.001) of oral mucositis was demonstrated when PVP-I was used four times daily as part of a standard prophylactic mucositis regimen compared with the standard regimen (nystatin, dexpanthenol, rutoside and immunoglobulin) alone (89, 90) . Similarly, when PVP-I was used in a multi-agent mouthrinse, the incidence and severity of OM was reduced (91) . It is therefore legitimate to speculate that anti-inflammatory properties support the antimicrobial characteristics of PVP-I in OM treatment.
In a randomised controlled trial, the effect of three mouthwashes that included PVP-I, chlorhexidine and salt/sodium bicarbonate were assessed on patients with head and neck malignancies undergoing radiation-induced oral mucositis. PVP-I significantly reduced mucositis scores from the first week of radiotherapy compared with the control group. By weeks 4 and 5, mucositis scores in patients treated with PVP-I were significantly lower than the salt/ sodium bicarbonate group and the chlorhexidine group respectively (92) . These findings are further supported by a systematic review assessing the effectiveness of commonly used mouthwashes in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. No beneficial effects of chlorhexidine were noted, while PVP-I was found to reduce the severity of OM by as much as 30% compared with sterile water (93) .
While there are no specific recommendations on using mouthwashes for the prevention of oral mucositis in the 2013 MASCC/ISOO guidelines (94) , neither the use of chlorhexidine nor antimicrobial lozenges are recommended for OM prevention in patients undergoing radiotherapy. Furthermore, chlorhexidine is not recommended for treatment of established OM. These recommendations are based on conflicting trial results and insufficient evidence respectively (95) . The role of PVP-I in oral surgery and dental conditions
In addition to its broad-spectrum microbial activity and low potential for resistance, PVP-I has also demonstrated haemostyptic and anti-inflammatory effects during minor oral surgery (96) (97) (98) . In a singleblind randomised study, alveolar sockets of patients following tooth extraction were irrigated with either PVP-I plus saline or saline alone. Significantly, more patients in the PVP-I group experienced spontaneous bleeding cessation than those in the control group (p < 0.001). This study highlighted, for the first time, the haemostatic action of PVP-I. This effect was further demonstrated in a prospective pilot study assessing the time to optimal haemostasis in patients undergoing periapical surgery for single-rooted maxillary anterior tooth lesions (97) . Compared with saline, when PVP-I was used to irrigate the periapical surgical field with cotton, there was a significant reduction in the time to bleeding cessation at the apex (p = 0.004). There were also marked reductions in visual analogue scale scores of oedema on the first two post-operative days and in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (97) .
The efficacy of PVP-I as an anti-oedematous agent was also evident in a randomised controlled clinical trial of 30 patients undergoing mandibular third molar removal (split mouth design) (99) On assessing the postoperative effect of PVP-I (0.5 mg/ml) when used as an irrigant and coolant, a significant decrease in swelling and trismus was observed compared with saline control (p = 0.001). No significant difference was observed in pain scores between the treatment groups (99) . Similar observations were reported in another study in which the reduced postoperative swelling by PVP-I was attributed to the inhibitory effect on leukotriene B4 and leucocyte extravasation (98) .
Use of PVP-I as a prophylactic measure in dental surgery has also been demonstrated. A preprocedural rinse of PVP-I was shown to reduce the level of micro-organisms generated in aerosol and spatter during dental procedures with rotary instruments (100) .
Although largely preventable, the most common oral diseases that affect the general population are dental caries and periodontal disease (43) . In children with severe early childhood caries, PVP-I led to a significant reduction (p = 0.001) in the major cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans from postoperative baseline levels to 12 months of oral rehabilitation (101) . The reduction in bacterial count subsequently resulted in a decrease in caries relapse, defined as the presence of one or more new smooth surface caries lesion in a primary tooth (101) . These data supported earlier evidence of the effectiveness of PVP-I in the prevention of dental caries in 'high-risk' children who required general anaesthesia during oral rehabilitation (102) .
The efficacy of PVP-I has also been assessed in the settings of periodontitis and gingivitis. In a systematic review of chronic periodontitis, PVP-I as an adjunct to scaling and root planing was reported to have a small but significant beneficial effect on the enhancement of probing pocket depth reduction (103) . Use of PVP-I as an adjunct to non-surgery therapy (using an ultrasonic device) and in retreatment of patients for long-term management of advanced periodontitis was further demonstrated and shown to result in improved gingival conditions, reduced probing pocket depth and significant reductions of probing attachment level losses for up to 13 years (104) . In a separate study, PVP-I in combination with hydrogen peroxide as an adjunctive to normal oral hygiene led to marked reductions from baseline in gingival inflammation as reflected in lower plaque and papillary bleeding scores than the water comparator at 24 weeks (105) . Use of PVP-I has also been shown to extend to the management of odontogenic and deep fascial space infections such as dento-alveolar abscesses (106) .
The role of PVP-I in endodontic practice has also been reported (107, 108) . Two studies that assessed the effectiveness of a range of antiseptics that included 10% PVP-I in the rapid decontamination of gutta-percha cones artificially contaminated with bacterial cells and spores demonstrated bactericidal effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis spores approximately 5 min following PVP-I treatment (107) . Rapid decontamination was also demonstrated in a separate study in which 3-s treatment with 10% PVP-I was found to be efficient (108) .
More recently, the application of PVP-I to an artificial biofilm of two periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, showed effective suppression of these microbial constituents at concentrations indicated for daily oral rinse (109) . Notably, periodontal pathogens, P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, can be transmitted within family members. Periodontal treatment therefore involves elimination or significant suppression of the pathogen in diseased individuals by a high standard of oral hygiene (110) . These findings further reinforce the recommendations for preprocedural mouth rinsing in patients undergoing dental procedures to assist in the reduction in oral bacteria load (13, 27) . This is a particularly important consideration in patients who are at-risk of bacterial endocarditis (111) . Importantly, short-term use of PVP-I has not been shown to irritate healthy or diseased oral mucosa, or exhibit adverse effects, such as discoloration of teeth and tongue and change in taste (16) . Other studies reported an absence of irritation or damage to the oral mucosa with PVP-I rinsing over a period of 8 or 10 weeks (89, 112) ; and no discoloration of composite restorations were observed in children receiving PVP-I solution following dental rehabilitation (102) .
After almost 60 years on the market, the safety profile of PVP-I is well-established. Although measurable systemic absorption may occur with the long-term use of PVP-I, its clinical manifestation as thyroid dysfunction is not very common (51) . Previous studies reported PVP-I mouthwash used four times daily for a short period (2 weeks) or once-daily for a prolonged period (24 weeks) did not affect thyroid function (113, 114) . However, increases in serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations that may occur with prolonged PVP-I treatment (24 weeks), may benefit from a 3-week drug holiday to allow the serum TSH levels to return to baseline levels (114) . PVP-I is therefore not to be used in those with hyperthyroidism and other diseases of the thyroid. In addition, the use of PVP-I gargle should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if strictly indicated, and should be kept to the absolute minimum (115) . PVP-I was found to be favourably tolerated by children receiving PVP-I for dental conditions (102), and in general was shown to be 20 times better tolerated than other common antiseptics (116) . While a few cases of allergic dermatitis after prolonged skin contact with PVP-I have been reported (117) , this is considered to be a rare complication and differs to local pruritus and skin irritation (117, 118) . Overall, the allergenic profile of PVP-I compares well to those of other antiseptics (118) .
From a clinical practice perspective, the choice of an appropriate antiseptic product for topical oral use is likely to depend on the oropharyngeal site of disease and infection, as well as the active ingredient and patient preference. While lozenges with analgesic/ anaesthetic properties are becoming increasingly popular for use in URTIs for example (119) , their perception as being a 'throat sweet' may lead to unintentional over dosing (120, 121) .
Large, well-designed randomised clinical trials are considered the gold standard for assessing a treat-ment intervention (122) . However, their findings can have limited applicability to patients in clinical practice (122) , who are likely to be more heterogeneous. For PVP-I, the number of studies required for the various oropharyngeal conditions and the possible comparators make this an impractical task. Nevertheless, several studies that include in vitro, 'real-world' and small-scale randomised studies of PVP-I provide evidence of its efficacy in preventing and treating common oral and oropharyngeal disorders. The benefits of PVP-I are reflected in its broad-spectrum anti-infective profile, its low potential for resistance as well as its haemostatic and antiinflammatory properties. Furthermore, PVP-I is available in different strengths and formulations: as a 10%, 7.5% and 1% PVP-I gargle and mouthwash across Asia; and e.g. in Japan it is also available as a throat spray (0.45% w/v formulation), thereby allowing flexibility in dosing regimens to suit individual patient's needs.
The regimen and length of PVP-I use will depend on the condition to be treated or prevented, as well as the susceptibility of the offending micro-organisms towards PVP-I. Clearly, the desired effect, the concentration of the solution and the time of exposure need to be balanced. Patient compliance and motivation are essential, especially if longer gargling or rinsing times are necessary. In general, gargling and rinsing with 10-15 mL undiluted PVP-I followed up for a minimum of 30 s is appropriate for the treatment and prevention of sore throats (34) and for prophylactic use before, during and after surgery. Longer rinsing (2 min) is suggested for the treatment of existing mouth lesions; and for oral mucositis, rinsing the mouth with undiluted PVP-I for up to 3 min and after meals is considered optimal (90, 92) . Given the potential of PVP-I in reducing the incidence of airborne or droplet-transmitted respiratory infections (e.g. SARS, avian flu, swine flu) (38, 39) , undiluted PVP-I can be used as a protective measure by rinsing the mouth for 2 min up to four times a day.
PVP-I can also be used as part of routine hygiene practices, for which gargling followed by rinsing of the mouth for 30 s using 10-15 ml of diluted or undiluted mouthwash is suggested. While PVP-I gargle or mouthwash can be diluted in defined clinical settings, if done by a patient, careful instructions on proper dilution should be strongly advised.
While there has been no formal study assessing the optimal length of treatment with PVP-I gargle or mouthwash, clinical practice and expert opinion suggests 14 days for URTIs and between 4-10 weeks for oral mucositis. In the oncology setting, patients with laryngeal cancer undergoing radiotherapy are typi- cally treated with PVP-I for 6 weeks and nasopharyngeal cancer patients are recommended PVP-I for 8 weeks.
Antiseptics, such as PVP-I, address the challenges in many clinical settings, where infectious conditions must be prevented or treated. By mediating a localised effect and sparing or preventing the use of antibiotics, they provide a viable option in the therapeutic armamentarium against common oropharyngeal infections.",Practical use of povidone‐iodine antiseptic in the maintenance of oral health and in the prevention and treatment of common oropharyngeal infections,"Kanagalingam, J.; Feliciano, R.; Hah, J.

4,6ff8826ca04c185f3a88ab4b0d5a912aea4ab1a6,"The synthesis and characterization of isotopomer tandem nucleic acid mass tag-peptide nucleic acid (TNT-PNA) conjugates is described along with their use as electrospray ionisation-cleavable (ESI-Cleavable) hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of target DNA sequences by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). ESI-cleavable peptide TNT isotopomers were introduced into PNA oligonucleotide sequences in a total synthesis approach. These conjugates were evaluated as hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of immobilized synthetic target DNAs using ESI-MS/MS. In these experiments, the PNA portion of the conjugate acts as a hybridization probe, whereas the peptide TNT is released in a collision-based process during the ionization of the probe conjugate in the electrospray ion source. The cleaved TNT acts as a uniquely resolvable marker to identify and quantify a unique target DNA sequence. The method should be applicable to a wide variety of assays requiring highly multiplexed, quantitative DNA/RNA analysis, including gene expression monitoring, genetic profiling and the detection of pathogens.","Mass spectrometry has much to offer the field of genomic analysis, particularly in terms of multiplexed analysis and accurate quantification. To date, many mass spectrometry-based approaches for genomic analysis have been based on direct detection of nucleic acids particularly using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-offlight (MALDI TOF) MS analysis. MALDI TOF is well suited to this approach due to the high mass range achievable by TOF analysis, however, MALDI TOF instrumentation is relatively expensive and sample preparation can be quite laborious. In addition, direct analysis of nucleic acids by mass spectrometry suffers from problems such as depurination leading to fragmentation (1) or cation adduct formation (2, 3) . These issues notwithstanding, MALDI TOF analysis of nucleic acids has been applied to DNA sequencing (4, 5) , RNA sequencing (6, 7) , analysis of DNA tandem repeats (8) . In particular, PNA probes, with and without noncleavable mass modifiers, have been used for characterization of genomic DNA libraries (9) , detection of DNA methylation (10) and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (11, 12) by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry.
Electrospray ionisation (ESI) mass spectrometry has also been used for direct detection of nucleic acids (13) (14) (15) . ESI-MS has some advantages over MALDI TOF MS particularly the availability of lower cost instrumentation. Moreover, sample handling can be simpler since most molecular biology assays are carried out in solution and such liquid samples are injected directly into the instrument. Furthermore, very high molecular weight species can be analysed due to the propensity for large molecules, such as PCR products, to form multiply charged ions that have relatively low overall mass-to-charge ratios under electrospray ionisation conditions. However, direct analysis of nucleic acids by ESI-MS still suffers from the same problems as MALDI TOF MS such as cation adduct formation (14) . In addition, the multiply charged ion spectra that are generated for large nucleic acid fragments can be very complicated reducing sensitivity and making multiplexing difficult (16) .
As an alternative to direct analysis of nucleic acids, mass spectrometry can also be used to detect nucleic acids indirectly through the use of cleavable mass tags, which avoids many of the limitations of direct analysis of nucleic acids while also offering numerous advantages such as ease of multiplexing, more robust detection of tag species and higher sensitivity and less demanding workup and sample preparation for analysis. Mass spectrometric analysis of mass tags, by ESI or MALDI also offers the possibility of accurate quantification through the use of isotopic tags. This capability of mass spectrometry has not really been exploited in genomic analysis but has been quite widely used in proteomic analysis (17) (18) (19) and is a key advantage of the mass spectrometric approach.
Again MALDI TOF analysis of nucleic acids with cleavable mass tags has been demonstrated by various groups (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) but it would be advantageous to be able to take advantage of lower cost ESI-MS/MS instruments and to avoid the laborious sample workup requirements of most MALDI approaches. A matrix-free laser desorption approach, which has reduced workup requirements has been demonstrated (21, 25) but this still requires that the sample be spotted onto a MALDI target or hybridized to an array. To our knowledge, only one mass tagging approach employing ESI-MS analysis has been demonstrated (26) . In this approach, mass tags are photocleavably linked to oligonucleotides and tag detection requires a photo-cleavage step and a tag isolation step outside of the mass spectrometer prior to tag detection, i.e. the workup is not much simpler than that required for MALDI TOF analysis.
Here, we describe the synthesis of novel ESI-cleavable Tandem Nucleic acid mass Tag-peptide nucleic acid conjugates and their analysis by ESI-MS/MS. We demonstrate a novel mass tag cleavage method in which source voltages in the electrospray ionisation source are used to cleave an ESI-cleavable linker, by a collision-based process, releasing the mass tag from the oligonucleotide during ionization. This method allows for direct analysis of assay solutions without requiring complex workups to cleave and isolate tags. In principle, this cleavage method would also allow in-line separation, by capillary electrophoresis for example, of labelled nucleic acids with direct spraying of the separated material into the ion source where tag cleavage would take place automatically.
In addition, we demonstrate a novel MS/MS-based tandem nucleic acid mass tag (TNT) design and detection process that allows highly specific detection of TNTs in a complex background. The Tandem Nucleic acid mass Tag design also allows easy synthesis of large sets of isotopic tags supporting the development of multiplexed and quantitative assays. We demonstrate the quantitative nature of the TNT approach. Furthermore, we evaluate ESI-cleavable TNT-PNA conjugates as hybridization probes for the detection of target DNA sequences via the use of ESI-MS/MS.
The TNTs described here are constructed using FMOC peptide synthesis chemistry. Synthesis of peptide nucleic acid-TNT peptide conjugates is relatively straightforward as PNA synthesis can be achieved using the same FMOC protection groups that are used in peptide synthesis (27) . This means that peptide TNT-PNA conjugates can be synthesized on the same resin in a continuous process. PNA is a useful analogue of DNA and is advantageous for this application due to its high specificity and its neutral backbone, which means that it does not require high concentrations of salt to hybridize making it highly compatible with mass-spectrometry-based detection methods (28) (29) (30) .
The outline of the general approach for the detection of DNA sequences via ESI-cleavable TNT-PNA conjugates is presented in Figure 1 . The ESI-cleavable TNT-PNA conjugates consist of a PNA probe portion, which interacts with the immobilized target sequence (DNA or RNA) and a peptide tandem nucleic acid mass tag portion, which is ultimately detected. Note that the TNT shown is merely a representation of the tag and not a real structure ( Figure 2 ). An ESI-cleavable linker connects the PNA probe portion of the conjugate to the tandem nucleic acid mass tag peptide. The complete TNT 'Parent Tag' comprises the red 'Tag Fragment' portion and the blue 'Mass Normalizer' portion shown in Figure 1 . The TNT marker is designed to have a unique combination of parent tag mass and tag fragment mass, released during collision induced dissociation (CID), and it is this pair of masses that serves as the sequence identifier. In a typical scenario (Figure 1 ), a set of PNA hybridization probes labelled with different TNTs is first hybridized to the captured target nucleic acids of interest (step (1)). After stringent washes to remove the non-hybridized probes (step (2)), the probes are denatured from the target (step (3)) and injected into an ESI-MS/MS instrument for detection (step (4)). In the mass spectrometer, the TNTs cleave from the PNAs during electrospray ionization (step (5)). The TNT parent tag ions are then selected from the background, fragmented by CID and finally, daughter, tag fragment ions from the fragmentation are detected (step (6)), confirming that the signals are indeed due to the presence of tagged probes, thereby detecting the presence of the target sequences.
The use of this MS/MS-based approach offers high specificity allowing TNT labels to be detected in a background of fragmentation noise. In addition, the MS/ MS detection means that tags can share the same mass as long their tag fragment ions are distinguishable from each other. This means that many TNTs can be detected in a compressed mass range. This feature combined with the relatively low overall mass required for TNTs, means that TNT technology will be able to exploit lower cost compact and portable ESI-MS/MS instrumentation that is currently under development (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) .
FMOC-protected peptides were custom synthesized by PepSyn Ltd (Liverpool, UK) using commercially available FMOC-protected amino acids on a Beckman synthesizer.
4-FMOC-piperazin-1-ylacetic acid was obtained from Fluka (Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK). The amino acid isotope 13 C 3 , 15 N-FMOC-L-alanine was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc (Andover, MA). The sequences of the TNT peptides used for the preparation of ESI-cleavable TNT-PNA probes are shown in Table 1 .
Peptide nucleic acid oligonucleotide syntheses were carried out using a 2-mmol cycle on an Expedite 8900 synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For the preparation of peptide-PNA conjugates, the FMOCprotected peptide TNT sequence was synthesized and left on the resin by PepSyn Ltd with the N-terminal FMOC left intact. The resin was extracted from the peptide synthesizer column and was then loaded into the Expedite synthesizer column (2 mmol per column). PNA synthesis was carried out as normal on the preloaded resin. The yield of each purified conjugate was in the range 4.3-32 OD 260 , which corresponds to a 1.5-21% yield based on the 2-mmol synthesis scale. The sequences and yields of the TNT-PNA probes are shown in Table 2 .
Biotinylated, fully complementary target 50-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides for the hybridization experiments were synthesized by Yorkshire Bioscience (York, UK) on a 1-mmol scale. Target sequences are shown in Table 3 .
TNT-PNA stock solutions were made up at a concentration of 20 pmol/ml in water. Biotinylated target sequences were made up in stock solutions of 50 pmol/ml in water.
Six aliquots of 20 ml of stock solution of the first TNT-PNA probe was mixed with 20, 10, 4, 2, 1 and 0.5 ml of the second TNT-PNA, respectively. To these, water was added to make up the solution to a total of 40 ml. The aliquots were then made up to 80 ml with methanol and formic acid to give a final solution of the TNT-PNA probes in 50:50 water:methanol with 1% formic acid. These samples were then analysed by direct injection ESI-MS/MS.
Five aliquots of 50 ml of MyOne Streptavidin C1 Dynabeads (10 mg/ml suspension) were separated from their storage buffer and washed with twice with 50:50 methanol:water to remove potential mass spec contaminants. The beads were then washed with 1 Â Bind & Wash (B&W) buffer. B&W buffer for Dynabead incubation was made up according to the manufacturer's instructions: 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl. Six aliquots of 20 ml (1 nmol) of stock solution of one biotinylated target was incubated with the Dynabeads. These aliquots were all made up to 40 ml with the addition of 20 ml of 2 Â B&W buffer. The biotinylated targets were then incubated at room temperature with the streptavidin beads for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions to immobilize the targets on the beads. The target solution was then removed from the beads and the beads were washed twice with hybridization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM NaCl). A sixth aliquot of 100 ml of MyOne Streptavidin C1 Dynabeads was made up in the same way but this aliquot was incubated with 40 ml (2 nmol) of stock solution of the same biotinylated target and 40 ml of 2 Â B&W buffer.
Each aliquot of the first five aliquots of bead-captured target was then incubated with 50 ml of a TNT-PNA probe solution comprising 1 nmol of the TNT-PNA probe complementary to the target on the beads. Similarly, the sixth aliquot was then incubated with 100 ml of a second TNT-PNA probe solution comprising 2 nmol of the TNT-PNA probe complementary to the target but with the alternative TNT tag on the probe. Hybridization of all the aliquots was carried out at room temperature for two hours. After hybridization, the probe solution was removed from the beads and the beads were washed three times with ice-cold 70 mM aqueous ammonium citrate solution. After the wash step, the sixth aliquot was resuspended in 100 ml of ammonium citrate. Aliquots of the sixth aliquot were then pipetted into the first six aliquots: 20, 10, 4, 2, and 1 ml, respectively. The mixtures The TNT tags, outlined by the red broken line, are modular comprising different functional components that correspond to individual synthetic components in the automated synthesis of these reagents. Each TNT is composed of two parts. The first part is a tag fragment, drawn in red, that comprises a charge-carrying group, the piperazine moiety outlined by the black broken box, and an alanine mass modifier group, outlined by the green broken box. The tag fragment is linked to the second part of the tag, which is a mass normalization group, drawn in blue, that ensures that each tag in a pair of tags shares the same overall mass and atomic composition. Note that the tags shown above are not strictly isobaric due to an issue with the synthesis discussed in the text. The mass normalization group is essentially uncharged and comprises a second alanine mass modifier group to adjust the overall mass of the tag and a proline group that is part of the electrospray cleavable linker. The ESI-cleavable linker is outlined by another black broken box and comprises an aspartic acid proline linkage. Part (ii) of Figure 2a Tables 1 and 2. were then mixed thoroughly. The hybridized TNT-PNA probes were then denatured from their captured target by incubating the beads at 858C for 20 min in 50:50 water:methanol with 1% formic acid. The elution solutions were then analysed by direct injection ESI-MS/MS.
Six aliquots of 125 ml of MyOne Streptavidin C1 Dynabeads (10 mg/ml suspension) were separated from their storage buffer and washed with twice with 50:50 methanol:water to remove potential MS contaminants. The beads were then washed with 1 Â B&W buffer. Six aliquots of 20 ml (1 nmol) of stock solution of one biotinylated target was mixed with 20, 10, 4, 2, 1 and 0.5 ml, respectively of the other biotinylated target. To these, water was added to make up the solution to a total of 40 ml. The aliquots were then made up to a volume of 80 ml by addition of 40 ml of 2 Â B&W buffer. These aliquots were then added to the aliquots of washed beads. The biotinylated targets were then incubated at room temperature with the streptavidin beads for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions to immobilize the targets on the beads. The target solution was then removed from the beads and the beads were washed twice with hybridization buffer.
Each aliquot of captured target was then incubated with 100 ml of TNT-PNA probe solution comprising 1 nmol of each of two TNT-PNA probes of the same length in hybridization buffer, i.e. 1 nmol of ANTHRAX-12 would be mixed with 1 nmol MOMP-12. Hybridization was carried out at room temperature for two hours. After hybridization, the probe solution was removed from the beads and the beads were washed three times with ice-cold 70 mM aqueous ammonium citrate solution.
The hybridized TNT-PNA probes were then denatured from their captured target by incubating the beads at 858C for 20 min in 50:50 water:methanol with 1% formic acid. The elution solutions were then analysed by direct injection ESI-MS/MS.
ESI-MS/MS spectra were obtained on a Micromass Q-TOF Micro mass spectrometer (Micromass (Waters), Wythenshaw, UK). The TNT-PNA oligonucleotides were denatured from the Dynabeads into 50:50 Methanol:Water with 1% formic acid. Mass spectra were externally calibrated using the manufacturer's standards and calibration protocols.
Tandem nucleic acid mass tag-PNA oligonucleotide probe design and synthesis Two pairs of example TNT-PNA oligonucleotide probes are shown in part (i) of Figure 2a and b. The TNTs are peptides comprising two parts, the tag fragment portion, which carries a charge due to the presence of a tertiary amino-functionality and the mass normalization portion, which remains essentially uncharged. These two portions of the tag are linked by a cleavage enhancement group, a piperazine ring, which also carries the charge of the tag fragment on its tertiary amino-group. The two tag portions both comprise a mass modifier component, which are isotopes of alanine in this tag although a large number of different mass modifiers could be used. It can be seen from Figure 2 that the two tags shown employ the same mass modifier components but the order differs Beta Alanine -Aspartic Acid -Proline -13 C 3 , 15 N-Alanine -Piperazin-1-ylacetic acid -Alanine TNT2
Beta Alanine -Aspartic Acid -Proline -Alanine -Piperazin-1-ylacetic acid -13 C 3 , 15 N-Alanine between the tags. Thus, the overall masses of the tags are the same but the tag fragments have different masses, which are equalized by the mass of the mass normalization portion. These tags are designed so that on analysis by collision-induced dissociation (CID), the tag fragment is released to give rise to a uniquely resolvable ion. Thus, this pair of tags allows a pair of PNA probes to be distinguished by MS/MS analysis. Each tag is linked to a PNA oligonucleotide probe by a second linker, comprising aspartic acid and proline that is easily cleaved by CID (37) . As shown in Figure 2 , the aspartic acid/proline linker is used to cleave the tags from their oligonucleotides during electrospray ionization of the tagged oligonucleotides. The expected structures and mass-to-charge ratios of the cleaved parent tag ions generated by dissociation of the aspartic acid/proline linkage are shown in part (ii) of figure 2a and b (37) . Similarly, the expected structures and mass-to-charge ratios of the tag fragment ions and the structures of the neutral mass normalizer fragments, based on the predictions of the 'mobile proton' model of peptide fragmentation (38, 39) , are shown in part (iii) of Figure 2a and b. The use of FMOC peptide synthesis chemistry to synthesize the TNTs combined with FMOC PNA chemistry to synthesize the oligonucleotide probe sequence means the same resin can be used to synthesize both portions of the tagged probe in a single total synthesis approach. For the probes discussed here, the TNT portion of the probe was synthesized in a commercial peptide synthesizer using standard peptide synthesis resin cartridges. The cartridge was then opened and the resin within was loaded into a cartridge suitable for a commercial oligonucleotide synthesizer that supports PNA synthesis (Expedite DNA/PNA synthesizer), allowing the completion of the synthesis of the probe. The completed probe was then cleaved from the resin and deprotected in one step (TFA/cresol) and then purified. With this approach, only one purification step is required resulting in better yields of finished probe than multi-stage processes. Figure 3 illustrates the ease with which a substantial number of tags can be synthesized from a small set of mass modifier components: nine tags, shown in Figure 3b can be made from three mass modifiers, which are the three commercially available isotopes of alanine shown in Figure 3a . In fact, the number of tags that can be synthesized increases as the square of the number of mass modifier components, e.g. there are at least five isotopes of alanine with different masses that are commercially available which would actually allow the synthesis of 25 tags using the design presented here.
One issue that emerged from the experiments presented here was a loss of 13 C isotope from the carboxylic acid of alanine when the alanine isotope was present at the C-terminus of the peptide TNT, i.e. in TNT2 shown in Table 1 . This loss is consistent across every TNT-PNA synthesized with TNT2 and may be an effect of the resin used, which relied on a 4-HydroxyMethyl-Phenoxy Acetic acid (HMPA) linker to the carboxylic acid group of the first amino acid to allow the peptide to be cleaved from the resin at the end of the synthesis. Other resins will be tested in future to avoid the loss of isotope. This has meant that the TNTs synthesized were not completely isobaric as shown in Figure 2 . The mass of the singly charged parent tag ion of TNT1 is 388.2 while that of TNT2 is 387.2. For the MS/MS analysis of these tags, both tags could still be selected simultaneously by the first quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument, as the mass range that is gated is actually about 3 daltons for the default setting of The TNT approach is similar in principle to other mass tagging techniques and enjoys the same features as other approaches, such as ease of multiplexing and the ability to design tag masses to suit applications, with some additional advantages. TNT tags can be made chemically identical, even sharing the same mass as long as the tag fragments are different, so they can act as more precise reciprocal internal standards, which leads to more accurate quantification and the same behaviour in analytical separations, hybridizations and labelling reactions thus avoiding 'dye effects' that plague fluorescent methods (40, 41) . The use of an MS/MS-based detection method allows TNTs to be selected from background noise thus improving signal to noise ratios. This allows untagged material to be ignored, greatly improving data quality.
To confirm that the TNT-PNA oligonucleotide conjugates cleave as they are expected to (see expected fragment structures and mass-to-charge ratios in Figure 2 ), the TNT-PNA oligonucleotides were analysed by ESI-MS/MS on a micromass quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer. The complete TNT-PNA probe molecules were initially ionized with the cone voltage (an accelerating voltage in the ESI source that can be varied on the micromass instrument to control the levels of collision induced dissociation) set to minimize fragmentation of the whole TNT-PNA probe conjugate ions. The whole molecular ions were selected using the first quadrupole of the instrument and were then subjected to collision induced dissociation at different collision energies. Fragmentation of the complete TNT-PNA conjugate ions was carried out as it allows both the cleavage of the TNT parent tag from the PNA and the cleavage of the tag fragment from the parent tag to be seen simultaneously in the TOF analyser of the Q-TOF instrument thus demonstrating both cleavage processes and their relative efficiencies. Typical results are shown in Figure 4 , in which it can be seen that, as the collision energy is increased, the whole TNT-PNA probe ion fragments to release the parent tag ion as the predominant fragmentation product. As the fragmentation energy is increased further, the parent tag ion undergoes subsequent consecutive fragmentation to give the desired daughter fragment ion. As the collision energy increases further, the intensity of the parent tag ion increases. Similarly, the ratio of the daughter ion to parent ion increases more. These results show that the TNT-PNA probe molecules fragment as anticipated with the aspartic acid/proline linkage cleaving more easily than the piperazine linkage. The higher collision energy spectra are quite noisy as these also contain other products from the fragmentation of the TNT-PNA probe molecule, which would not normally be present when the TNT parent tag ions are analysed by themselves.
The normal mode of analysis is shown in Figure 5 . Here the cone voltage in the electrospray ion source is increased to 25 V increasing the level of fragmentation during ionization thus releasing the parent tag ion from the TNT-PNA conjugate. The parent tag ion is then selected from background by the first quadrupole in the Q-TOF instrument. The parent tag ion is subsequently subjected to CID in the second quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument. A collision energy of 25 V was used for CID. MS/MS spectra showing the detected tag fragment ions are shown in Figure 5 . These spectra show ratios of two tags and demonstrate the accuracy of quantification of the TNT technology, which is discussed in the next section.
A brief experiment to determine whether there were any obvious size dependent effects on the efficiency of the cleavage of the TNT from the TNT-PNA conjugate during electrospray ionisation was carried out. In this experiment, pairs of TNT-PNA oligonucleotides of different lengths were mixed together in 1:1 concentrations. It might be expected that the larger TNT-PNA probes would fragment somewhat less easily due to their greater size and the consequent ability to dissipate kinetic energy from collisions over many more different modes of vibration. This would mean that the larger probes should be detected with less sensitivity. It turned out that the larger sequences gave slightly more sensitivity with the 16-mer being almost twice as sensitive as the 8-mer in this experiment. This result may reflect the mechanisms of cleavage and detection, which are dependent on protonation of the aspartic acid and the piperazine groups in the tags. The larger probes tend to adopt higher charge states (not shown), i.e. they are more heavily protonated and the availability of more free protons on the larger probe ions may facilitate the cleavage of the tags, masking steric effects. However, only three different size molecules were evaluated, and this will be explored more fully in future.
A key feature of the Tandem Nucleic acid mass Tag design is the ease with which large numbers of chemically identical, isotopomeric tags can be made (Figure 3) . Sets of TNT isotopes should have almost identical behaviour in analytical separations (17) and during the ionization process. This means that it should be possible to use these tags to accurately quantify their associated oligonucleotide sequences as the ratios of the intensities of the TNT isotopomer fragments should reflect the ratios of the concentrations of the probes in solution or hybridized on their targets ( Figure 5 ). To demonstrate this feature of the TNT design, various experiments were conducted. In these experiments, pairs of TNT-PNA conjugates are analysed by ESI-MS/MS, where the parent tag ions are cleaved from their probes in the ESI ion source using a cone voltage of 25 V. The cleaved parent tag ions are subsequently selected from background by gating both 387.3 and 388.3 ions with the first quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument. The gated parent tag ions are then subjected to CID in the second quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument using a collision energy of 25 V followed by mass separation and detection in the TOF analyser to determine the ratios of the tag pairs. In the first set of experiments, pairs of TNT-PNA oligonucleotide probes of the same length and sequence, but with different tags were mixed in a predefined ratio and diluted to determine how well the ratios are conserved as the concentration of probes is decreased. Results are shown in Figure 6 . It can be seen that the ratios of the isotopic TNT-PNA probes are conserved over the range of concentrations investigated.
In a second experiment, pairs of TNT-PNA probes of the same length were mixed in various different ratios. The correlation between the expected and measured quantities of these different TNT-PNA ratios is shown in Figure 7 . It can be seen that there are simple linear correlations between the expected and measured ratios. The blue crosses in Figure 7 indicate the results of experiments where the two TNT-PNA probes with the same sequences but with different isotopomeric tags were mixed, i.e. the whole TNT-PNA probes were isotopes of each other. The measured ratios for these probes closely match the expected ratios.
The red squares in Figure 7 indicate the results of experiments where the two different probe sequences of the same length were mixed, i.e. although their TNT labels were different isotopes of each other, the complete TNT-PNA probes were not isotopes of each other. The red line represents a linear regression through these data points. Although the predicted and expected ratios do not match exactly, there is a good correlation between the results indicating that the measurements are quantitative. Since the TNT-PNA probes were actually different in these experiments, it is pleasing to see that there is correlation between the measured and expected quantities and the result suggests that, in future use, the measurements of the quantity of different targets in a sample could be calibrated against an internal control such as a housekeeping gene or, preferably, a known quantity of a spiked target sequence.
Quantification of hybridized probes was also evaluated. In the first experiment, external calibration of the quantities of hybridized probes was assessed, i.e. the amount of target in one sample was probed with a TNT-PNA whose abundance was then determined by comparison with a second reference sample comprising a predefined quantity of the duplex of the same target sequence and PNA probe sequence, but with a different TNT isotope conjugated to the probe, after the hybridization. In these studies, aliquots of a synthetic biotinylated 50-mer DNA oligonucleotide target was captured onto avidinated magnetic beads and hybridized with TNT-PNA probes with identical probe sequences but different tags. The hybridized beads were then mixed in different ratios. The target, arbitrarily selected, was a fragment of a sequence from the MOMP gene from Chlamydia pneumoniae. A fixed quantity of one TNT-PNA probe complementary to one of the targets was hybridized to the captured target sequences. The aliquots of beads were then washed extensively to remove probe that had not hybridized. The captured TNT-PNA probe mixture was then eluted into 50:50 water:methanol with 1% formic acid (a solvent suitable for ESI-MS/MS analysis) by thermal denaturation. The eluted TNT-PNA and the spike were then injected directly into the Q-TOF instrument for MS/MS analysis. The ratios of the intensities of the two tags derived from the TNT-PNAs should allow the amount of the target sequences in the pooled samples to be determined. Figure 8 shows the actual correlation between the expected and measured quantities of the target sequences. The results are very similar to the experiments where TNT-PNA probes with the same sequence but different tags are simply mixed together: the measured ratio matches very closely the expected ratio. Negative controls in which the target was absent do not show significant binding of TNT-PNA conjugates to the beads so the probe binding is sequence specific. This gives a clear indication that the probes behave quantitatively in hybridization assays and that TNT-PNA probes can be used for accurate quantification.
A further evaluation of the quantification of the TNT-PNA conjugates was carried out to determine whether accurate relative quantification can be derived from TNT-PNA pairs with different PNA sequences, i.e. can a reference sequence in a sample probed with one TNT-PNA be used to quantify a second sequence with a different PNA probe as long as the TNTs used in the probe pair are isotopes of each other. This would enable quantification by internal calibration using spiked sequences, housekeeping genes or similar controls in quantitative expression profiling or diagnostic assays. In these experiments, a pair of biotinylated 50-mer target oligonucleotides was used (MOMP-50 again and a sequence from B. anthracis, ANTHRAX-50; see Table 3 ). These were captured onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The quantity of one target was fixed while the relative quantity of the second was varied. The captured targets were then hybridized at room temperature with a probe solution comprising equal quantities of MOMP-12-TNT1 and Anthrax-12-TNT2 probes (see Table 2 ). Probes of the same length were used together. After the hybridization, the magnetic beads were washed as before and the hybridized TNT-PNAs were eluted from their targets on the beads into 50:50 methanol:water with 1% formic acid and analysed as described earlier. Typical results are shown in Figure 8 . As observed in the simple mixture experiments, the measured TNT ratios show a linear relationship with the expected ratios but the measured quantities do not exactly match the expected ratios when the TNT-PNA probes being compared are not true isotopes but the linear relationship does mean that the measurements are quantitative. These data suggest that with appropriate choice of reference sequences, quantitative internal calibration should be achievable, which would be very useful in situations where suitable reference samples are not available for external calibration.

 quantitative detection of target DNA sequences by ESI-MS/MS has been described. The conjugates were prepared by first synthesizing the TNT tag peptide sequence in a peptide synthesizer, after which the peptide synthesis resin was transferred to a column compatible with a DNA synthesizer in which PNA can be prepared. The PNA sequence was extended directly from the peptide TNT. The use of PNA has several advantages for this application: (i) the oligonucleotide and the peptide TNT are generated in a single synthesis on the same resin, which means only a single purification step is required after the synthesis is completed; (ii) PNA is approximately 15% lower in mass than a corresponding DNA sequence, which Figure 8 . The relationship between the expected and measured ratio of mixtures of captured target sequences probed with 12-mer TNT-PNA probes.

We have shown that these TNT-PNA probes hybridize quantitatively and specifically to their targets and that the probes perform reliably over a wide dynamic range providing a new platform for multiplexed and quantitative genomic analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ESI-cleavable TNT mass markers described in this article have several properties that make them very useful for quantitative, multiplex assays, including the following: (i) The TNT portion can be elaborated into very large arrays of tags using only small numbers of starting components. The 20 standard amino acids as well as the large number of isotopic variants of these amino acids that are available provide the possibility of synthesis of numerous marker molecules that are easily resolved by the unique combination of parent and daughter ion massto-charge ratios; (ii) The ESI-cleavability allows direct analysis of solution phase assays without complex workup of the samples unlike MALDI, which requires that samples are spotted onto targets; (iii) The ESI-cleavable linker connecting the DNA and the TNT components cleaves virtually instantaneously during electrospray ionisation that will allow separations such as capillary electrophoresis to be performed in-line with the MS/MS analysis; (iv) In-line separation allows for a further level of multiplexing over and above the large numbers of available tags since the probes can be identified by their elution time as well as by their tag and in future work, we will explore the use of this feature to enable in-line coupling of analytical separations such as capillary electrophoresis; (v) sets of isotopic TNTs can be synthesized that behave identically during separations, hybridizations and labelling reactions enabling accurate measurements of quantities of target nucleic acids without 'dye effects' widening the range of applications for which mass tags can be employed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The use of TNT-PNA oligonucleotide conjugates offer many of the advantages of fluorescent detection such as high specificity, ease and safety of handling and high sensitivity with the additional unmatched advantages that result from being able to generate large numbers of tags with predefined masses and from being able to construct these sets of tags with stable isotopes generating chemically identical entities that will behave the same in labelling reactions and in separation steps. This means that multiplexed analyses with accurate quantification are now enabled in a user-friendly format. Future experiments will be directed towards evaluation of the TNT-PNA probes for post-PCR amplicon detection. In addition, the development of TNT-DNA oligonucleotide conjugates and evaluation of these probes as primers for multiplexed PCR amplification and subsequent detection of PCR amplicons will also be pursued. The ability to employ in-line capillary electrophoresis with immediate cleavage and detection of tags will be of particular interest as many genomics assays, such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms," satellite marker analysis and multiplexed PCR employ size separations and the ability to perform such analyses with the higher levels of multiplexing enabled by this technology will be of great advantage.""",Electrospray ionisation-cleavable tandem nucleic acid mass tag–peptide nucleic acid conjugates: synthesis and applications to quantitative genomic analysis using electrospray ionisation-MS/MS,"Thompson, Andrew; Prescott, Mark; Chelebi, Noorhan; Smith, John; Brown, Tom; Schmidt, Günter",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1994780/,159,5985,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,0994b9aa851f17dc1c6af309973fe189118ab6c5,"The distribution of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) at entry portals indicates its involvement in defending the host from pathogens, consistent with the ability of SLPI to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by an unknown mechanism. We now demonstrate that SLPI binds to the membrane of human macrophages through the phospholipidbinding protein, annexin II. Based on the recent identification of human cell membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer coat of HIV-1, we define a novel role for annexin II, a PS-binding moiety, as a cellular cofactor supporting macrophage HIV-1 infection. Moreover, this HIV-1 PS interaction with annexin II can be disrupted by SLPI or other annexin II-specific inhibitors. The PS-annexin II connection may represent a new target to prevent HIV-1 infection.
Abbreviations used in this paper: LC-MS/MS, nano-capillary HPLC ion trap mass spectrometry; PS, phosphatidylserine; rhSLPI, recombinant human secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SLPI, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor.","Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), originally identified as a serine protease inhibitor at portals of pathogen entry and in mucosal fluids (1) , has more recently been associated with multiple functions relevant to innate host defense (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . One of the first novel non-antiprotease functions identified for SLPI was its ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection of macrophages, which appeared to be effected through interaction with unidentified host cell molecules and not the virus (2, 3) . In addition to CD4, macrophages express CCR5 and CXCR4 that function as HIV-1 envelope gp120 coreceptors (10) , and once colonized by HIV-1, can function as stable reservoirs of the virus, thereby facilitating transmission of HIV-1 to CD4 ϩ lymphocytes (11, 12) . Persistent evidence favors the existence of additional cofactors for binding and/or entry of HIV-1, including components of the host cell membrane acquired during viral budding (13) . Among these host-derived constituents in the viral envelope is the phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS; reference 14) , which predicts a potential interactive molecule on the receptive host cell that may facilitate virus binding, entry, and/or fusion.
Despite tremendous efforts over the last decade, a cell surface receptor for SLPI has remained elusive. To decipher the mechanisms by which SLPI regulates target cell functions independent of protease inhibition, we searched for a membrane-binding protein/receptor for SLPI on mononuclear phagocytes that are susceptible to its antiinflammatory and antiviral activities (2) (3) (4) (6) (7) (8) . In this study, we document that SLPI binding to the macrophage cell membrane involves annexin II. Annexin II is a member of the larger annexin gene family and contains a variable NH 2 -terminal tail, a COOH-terminal region with heparin and plasminogen-binding sites, and the core domain, which includes binding sites for Ca 2 ϩ , phospholipids, and F-actin (15) (16) (17) (18) . Characterized by a highly conserved set of ␣ -helical repeats that mediate membrane binding, annexin II exists as a monomer (p36) or a heterotetramer constructed of two p36 and two p11(S100A10) subunits, and traffics to the cell surface by an unknown mechanism (18) . Although implicated in exocytosis and endocytosis pathways, as well as in ion channel activity and stimulation of DNA replication (17) , annexin II has not previously been linked to HIV-1. Nonetheless, annexin II has recently been identified as a receptor for CMV (19) and respiratory syncytial virus (20) , prompting our exploration of a potential role for annexin II in HIV-1 infection and as a conduit for inhibition by SLPI and/or other targeted interventions in the battle against AIDS.
Isolation of Monocytes. Human PBMCs, obtained by leukapheresis of healthy volunteers (Dept. of Transfusion Medicine, NIH), were diluted in endotoxin-free PBS without Ca 2 ϩ and Mg 2 ϩ for density sedimentation. Monocytes and T cells were purified by elutriation (2, 3) . Monocytes were cultured in DMEM (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 2 mM l -glutamine and 10 g/ml gentamicin. For monocyte-derived macrophages, monocytes were adhered and cultured in supplemented DMEM and 10% FBS for 7-10 d. The human myelomonocytic U937 cell line (American Type Culture Collection) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM l -glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS at 37 Њ C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 .
Biotinylation of Recombinant Human SLPI (rhSLPI). rhSLPI (R&D Systems) was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LCbiotin (Pierce Chemical Co.). rhSLPI and NHS-LC-biotin were diluted in PBS on ice and incubated for 2 h. To remove unreacted biotin, the mixture was centrifuged using centricon filters (YM-3; Millipore). After centrifugation, the sample was diluted in PBS, centrifuged twice, and the biotinylated protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Flow Cytometry. Cells were incubated with 10 g/ml rhSLPI for 60 min in DMEM at 37 Њ C, washed, and stained using 1 g/ ml of goat polyclonal anti-SLPI (R&D Systems) for 30 min at 4 Њ C. Antibody-treated cells were rinsed, incubated with FITCconjugated secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat; Jackson Im-munoResearch Laboratories), washed, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) before analysis on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CELL-Quest software (21, 22) . Additionally, cells were incubated with 1 g/ml of biotinylated rhSLPI for indicated intervals, washed, and then treated with streptavidin-FITC (Pierce Chemical Co.) in staining buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.01% sodium azide). For additional staining, elutriated T cells, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages detached from plastic with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) were suspended in PBS with 2% FBS and stained with 10 g/ml of polyclonal goat annexin II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat FITC; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Single and double labeling with PE-CD14, FITC-CCR5, PE-CD11c, or PE-CD4 (BD Biosciences) confirmed cell specificity in flow cytometry analysis.
Fluorescence Microscopy. 10 6 cells cultured in four-chamber glass slides (Nunc) were incubated with biotinylated rhSLPI from 5 s to 60 min at 37 Њ C, washed, and neutravidin-FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS was added for 30 min at 4 Њ C. Slides were rinsed, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, incubated with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min, rinsed, and mounted with SlowFade (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) for fluorescence microscopy. In additional experiments, monocytes were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (2 ϫ 10 6 per well) and cultured as described above for 7-10 d. Before staining, coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and then incubated in 100 mM glycine in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were rinsed in PBS, methanol permeabilized at Ϫ 20 Њ C for 5 min, and then blocked in 10% donkey serum for 30 min. 2 g/ml of primary antibody (mouse anti-annexin II; Transduction Labs) was added in 2% donkey serum in PBS, washed, and incubated for 1 h in 20 g/ml Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed twice in PBS, twice in dH 2 O, mounted using Fluormount G (Electron Microscopy Services), and visualized using the PerkinElmer UltraView LCI confocal system with a Nikon Eclipse microscope. For phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, Jurkat cells (200,000/ml) were treated with 0.2 M staurosporine at 37 Њ C for 7 h, washed, stained with 1 M carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20 min, and washed before being added (4 ϫ 10 6 ) to macrophages on coverslips. After 10 min at 37 Њ C, the coverslips were vigorously washed, fixed, and stained for annexin II as described above.
Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot. 200-300 ϫ 10 6 monocytes in suspension or 7-10-d adhered macrophages were washed with PBS. Cell pellets were collected and incubated in sucrose lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche Applied Science) on ice, and then sonicated. The nuclear fractions were discarded after centrifugation (2,000 rpm at 4 Њ C) and the membrane fraction was resuspended in PBS with protease inhibitors, centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 30 min), and then the cytosol fraction was discarded. Membrane protein fractions were sonicated and proteins were quantitated (Bio-Rad Laboratories) before being precleared with normal IgG and UltraLink immobilized protein A/G beads (Pierce Chemical Co.) with rotation (30 min at 4 Њ C). The beads were pelleted (2,500 rpm) for 5 min at 4 Њ C. The supernatant was incubated with rhSLPI for 5-10 min on ice and rotated for 1-2 h at 4 Њ C with polyclonal goat anti-rhSLPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse monoclonal anti-annexin II (IgG1; BD Biosciences), or anti-actin (IgG1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). UltraLink beads were added to this mixture and rotated overnight at 4 Њ C. The immunoprecipitates were boiled in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer after PBS wash and subjected to SDS-PAGE in Tris-glycine gels. For Western blot, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with 1 g/ml of polyclonal anti-SLPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-annexin II, anti-actin, or anti-␣ -tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Chemiluminescent signal was detected using the Supersignal West Pico system (Pierce Chemical Co.). Whole cell lysates from A431 or Jurkat cell lines were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories.
Nano-Capillary HPLC Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Membrane protein fractions from monocyte (2-10 ϫ 10 9 ) or macrophage (2-10 ϫ 10 9 ) coimmunoprecipitations were pooled and separated on SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with colloidal blue, destained, photographed, and the desired protein band(s) was marked before storage at 4 Њ C. The gels were analyzed with LC-MS/MS of in-gel tryptic digests for subsequent protein identification by database searching (Wistar Institute). The output from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and nonredundant database search using SEQUEST consists of peptide sequences matched to protein(s) in the database searched by correlated predicted and observed peptide fragmentation patterns.
RT-PCR. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN). 2 g RNA was reverse transcribed by oligodeoxythymidylic acid primer (Promega) and the resulting 1 l cDNA was amplified by PCR. The primer sets for annexin II were ATGTCTACTGTTCACGAAATC (sense) and AAT-GAGAGAGTCCTCGTCGG (antisense). For normalization, GAPDH primer sets were GTGAAGGTCGGGAGTCAACG-GATTT (sense) and CACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT (antisense). PCR was performed using 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 200 M deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 10 pmol of each primer, and 1 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified for 25 cycles with the following settings: 94 Њ C for 30 s, 55 Њ C for 30 s, and 68 Њ C for 30 s.
Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Inhibition of Annexin II. Annexin II siRNA 1 and 2 were synthesized based on the sequence r(GCACUGAAGUCAGCCUUAUUU)/r(AUAAGGCUG -ACUUCAGUGCUG) and r(CGGUGAUUUUGGGCCUAU-UUU)/r(AAUAGGCCCAAAAUCACCGUC; QIAGEN). An unrelated control siRNA was also purchased from QIAGEN. SiRNA was transfected into monocytes using the Amaxa Human Dendritic Cell Nucleofector kit following the protocol for nucleofection of suspension cells. The cells were incubated 6 d before analysis of annexin protein by Western blot and infection with HIV-1.
HIV-1 Infection. Adherent macrophages were infected with R5 HIV-1 BAL grown in primary human macrophage cultures (50 l TCID 50 ϭ 10 4 /ml; Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.) for 2 h at 37 Њ C, unbound virus was washed away, and the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS at 37 Њ C for 1-14 d (2, 3). One half of the supernatant was collected every 2-3 d and replaced with fresh medium. Supernatants were tested for HIV-1 p24 antigen by ELISA (PerkinElmer). For preparation of additional isolates, 60 ϫ 10 6 PHA-activated PBMCs were pelleted for 10 min at 1,500 rpm in a 15-ml conical tube, the supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of virus seed stock (HIV-1 JRCSF, ADA, and primary isolate Clade B 92US712; NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) was added to the target cells with gentle mixing. After 1-2 h of incubation, the cell/virus mixture was diluted to 30 ml with complete media (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 1% gentamycin, and 5% IL-2) and transferred to a T-25 tissue culture flask. On days 2, 4, 6, and 8 after infection, the cells were pelleted, the media was replaced, and day 6 and 8 culture supernatants were tested for p24 and RT activity, filtered through a 0.45-mm filter, vialed as 1.0-ml aliquots, and stored at Ϫ 70 Њ C before infection of macrophages.
In indicated experiments, macrophages were pretreated for 1 h with 25 g/ml rabbit anti-annexin II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 25 g/ml rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), or 10 g/ml SLPI before the addition of virus. Alternatively, the HIV-1 was preincubated with 10 g/ml annexin II tetramer (US Biological) for 1 h before being added to the macrophages. After HIV-1 coculture for 2 h, virus and/or added reagents were removed by washing cells with DMEM and fresh complete medium was added. For cell-binding experiments, macrophages were treated with anti-annexin II, control antibody, or SLPI for 30 min, washed, and virus was added for 30 min at 37 Њ C. The cells were washed extensively, lysed (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS), and p24 bound to the cells quantitated by ELISA. For infection of elutriated T cells, PHA-blasted T cells were infected with HIV-1 IIIB (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.) for 2 h, washed, cultured for 2-8 d, and supernatants were collected every 2-3 d for p24 ELISA. In some experiments, T cells were pretreated with rabbit anti-annexin II or rabbit IgG before infection.
Cell-free Binding Assay. 96-well plates (Nunc immunoplates with maxiSorp surface; Nunc) were coated with 60 g/ml BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), annexin II tetramer, IgG, or gp120 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) overnight at 4 Њ C, washed with PBS, and blocked or not with 1% BSA for 1-2 h. After two PBS washes, 100 l HIV-1 BaL (10 4 /ml) was added for 1 h at 4 Њ C (3). After multiple washes with PBS, 100 l of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100) was added. Virus was quantified by p24 ELISA.
PCR for Viral DNA. For a PCR-based assay for newly synthesized viral DNA (3), 200 l of DNase-treated HIV-1 BaL (10 4 / ml) was added to macrophages preincubated with anti-annexin II or control antibody for 30-60 min at 37 Њ C. After 2 h of coculture, the cells were washed three times with PBS, treated with trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mmol/l EDTA for 5 min at 24 Њ C) to remove noninternalized virus particles, washed twice with DMEM and 10% FCS, and incubated for 18-36 h. Cells were then washed, harvested in lysis buffer (100 mmol/l KCl, 10 mmol/l Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmol/l MgCl 2 , 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.5% NP-40), and 1 g of DNA was subjected to nested primer PCR amplification (25 l total volume). The first 35cycle round of amplification used primers corresponding to the env gene (nucleotide 8838 to 8358, HIV-1HXB2 sequence) and the U3 region of the 3 Ј long terminal repeat (nucleotide 9533 to 9558). Each cycle consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 94 Њ C, annealing for 1 min at 55 Њ C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 Њ C. PCR reactions (2.5 l each) from the first amplification were then subjected to a second 30-cycle amplification round using primers (5 Ј primer, nucleotide 8754 to 8782; 3 Ј primer, nucleotide 9436 to 9457) located within the nef gene. PCR products ( ‫ف‬ 730 bp) from the second amplification were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis.
In previous studies (3), we documented that 125 I-rhSLPI binds to human monocytederived macrophages in a specific, concentration-dependent, and saturable manner. In the current studies, SLPI binding was detected on SLPI-treated human monocytes and macrophages with anti-SLPI antibody or using 1 g/ ml of a biotinylated rhSLPI and streptavidin-FITC with enhanced sensitivity. Direct binding of SLPI to macrophage membranes was detected in Ն 85% of macrophages by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 A) . By fluorescence microscopy, cell surface rhSLPI-biotin-neutravidin-FITC complexes were evident within 1 min, peaked at 15-30 min (Fig. 1  B) , and frequently appeared to polarize before emerging in the cytosol, all consistent with a cell membrane-binding molecule/receptor.
Identification of the SLPI Membrane-binding Protein. To identify such a receptor, macrophage membrane proteins were isolated and SLPI immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. RhSLPI reproducibly coimmunoprecipitated with protein bands at 36 and ‫24ف‬ kD (Fig. 2  A) , which, being similar to previously described binding activity (3), were selected for further analysis. After in-gel tryptic digestion of these bands, the resultant peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and database searching (SEQUEST; Wistar Institute) revealed annexin II as the p36 SLPI-binding partner/receptor. Annexin II was confirmed with monoclonal anti-annexin II and rhSLPI coimmunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting (Fig.  2, B and C) . The p42 SLPI-binding protein band was identified by mass spectrometry as actin, which we determined does not interact with rhSLPI directly, but rather associates with annexin II as part of a trimolecular complex (not depicted).
The detected binding between annexin II and rhSLPI was typically higher on differentiated macrophages than on freshly isolated blood monocytes or an undifferentiated monocytic cell line (Fig. 2 C, U937) , consistent with labeling studies and with PCR analysis (Fig. 3 A) of annexin II mRNA expression in these populations. Although annexin II protein was not detected in lysates of a T cell line (Fig. 2 C, Jurkat), it was evident in epithelial cell lysates (Fig. 2 C,  A431) . Importantly, assessment of annexin II on CD4 ϩ blood mononuclear cells revealed differential membrane expression between freshly isolated resting CD4 ϩ T cells and CD14 ϩ monocytes (Fig. 3, B and C) . The absence of fluorescence staining of annexin II on CD4 ϩ T cells was confirmed by their lack of detectable annexin II membrane protein by Western blot (Fig. 3 D) . Collectively, these data identify mononuclear phagocytes as the predominant population expressing the SLPI membrane-binding protein, annexin II.
Annexin II Is a Cofactor for HIV Infection. Based on the link between SLPI, a known antagonist of HIV-1 infection (2, 3) , and annexin II, we attempted to abort infection by directly blocking annexin II. A single treatment of adherent macrophages with an antibody targeting the NH 2 -terminal tail of annexin II (Fig. 4, A and B) , but not the carboxy terminus (not depicted) nor an IgG isotype control (Fig. 4 B) , during the initial infection process resulted in significant (Ͼ90%) and durable (Ͼ14 d) suppression of R5 HIV-1 BaL infection. Infection was monitored by HIV-1 p24 antigen levels (Fig. 4) and by ultrastructural evidence of viral replication (not depicted). Furthermore, decreased expression of annexin II using RNA-mediated interference (RNAi; Fig.  4 C, inset) dramatically suppressed macrophage viral infection (Fig. 4 C) . Although suppression of annexin II protein by RNAi was not absolute, likely related to inability to transfect all cells and/or due to stability of intracellular annexin II, the reduced levels of annexin II were sufficient to interrupt the HIV-1 infection process, with the implication that there might be a threshold level of annexin II necessary for optimal infection. Furthermore, to establish that the suppression of viral infection was specific to annexin II levels, we monitored the macrophages treated with annexin II RNAi for CD4 and CCR5 expression in parallel. As evident by Western analysis (Fig. 4 D) and by flow cytometry (not depicted), no substantive change in these essential viral recognition and binding receptors was evident, consistent with a contributing role for annexin II in the macrophage infection process.
To determine whether annexin II played a role in infection of macrophages by viral isolates other than the laboratory-adapted BaL strain, macrophages were treated with an antibody to annexin II at the time of infection with two additional laboratory-adapted M tropic isolates (ADA and JRCSF) and a primary clinical isolate (Clade B 92US712). As evident in Fig. 4 E, by blocking access to annexin II with an annexin II-specific antibody, infection by all three viral strains was dramatically inhibited, paralleling the effect seen with BaL and underscoring the contribution of annexin II to the macrophage infection process. Moreover, in CD4 ϩ T cell infection with IIIB, antibodies to annexin II were not effective in blocking the virus (Fig. 4 F) . In additional stud-ies to establish whether annexin II represented a pathway unique to HIV-1 or supported infection with other viruses, we determined in preliminary experiments that annexin II appears to play no role in infection of cells with either Ebola virus or with SARS coronavirus (not depicted). Thus, annexin II appears to selectively contribute to the pathway by which HIV-1 infects human macrophages.
Annexin II Interacts with PS. How annexin II might support HIV-1 infection of macrophages was a mystery, but a recent study reporting that HIV-1 membranes contain PS (14) provided a potential clue. Although no binding partner for HIV-PS had been identified, we surmised that annexin II, a phospholipid-binding protein, might be a candidate. In this regard, direct binding of HIV-1 to platebound annexin II, but not irrelevant proteins, was demonstrated (Fig. 5 A) . Moreover, to verify an HIV-PS-macrophage annexin II connection, we exposed HIV-1 to excess soluble annexin II to bind/coat viral PS before addition to macrophages, and this markedly suppressed subsequent in- By RT-PCR, annexin II mRNA expression was higher in macrophages than freshly isolated blood monocytes (representative RT-PCR shown; graph represents mean Ϯ SD; n ϭ 3; *, P Ͻ 0.002). (B and C) By flow cytometry, purified CD4 ϩ CD14 ϩ monocytes expressed surface annexin II, with minimal expression on CD4 ϩ T cells. Shaded histograms represent annexin II fluorescence and white histograms represent cells stained with the isotype control antibody. (D) By coimmunoprecipitation and Western analysis, annexin II was detected in macrophage, but not T cell, membrane preparations. fection (Fig. 5 B) , compatible with inhibition of infection by soluble annexin V and/or PS vesicles (14) .
Annexin II Is Associated with Entry/Fusion of HIV-1 in Macrophages. Next, we focused on when in the virus life cycle annexin II cooperates with HIV-1 to promote infection. Consistent with SLPI (2, 3), blockade of annexin II on macrophages did not significantly interrupt HIV-1 binding to the cells (Fig. 5 C) , likely dissociating it from a direct interaction with CD4 and/or CCR5. In confirmatory studies, anti-annexin II was incorporated into a fusion assay in which effector cells expressing recombinant Env, but lacking viral PS, were cocultured with target cells expressing recombinant CD4 and coreceptors (23) . In the absence of PS, anti-annexin II was ineffective in interrupting this fusion process (not depicted), ruling out a specific interaction with Env, CD4, and/or coreceptors. These data emphasize the potential unique constraints of macrophage-HIV-1 entry events that might be optimized through an annexin II-PS cofactor linkage. Although the role of annexin II in viral entry may involve participation in internalization or structural/functional facilitation of fusion events, it was unclear whether membrane annexin II had intracellular access. Because apoptotic cells also bind through PS to annexin II on macrophages (24, 25), we exposed macrophages to apoptotic Jurkat cells (PS ϩ ) as a model of annexin II-dependent internalization. By immunofluorescence, annexin II could be found within the early phagosome membrane, consistent with surface membrane internalization (Fig. 5 D) . Whether internalization is essential to viral entry is under investigation, but by multiple criteria, the role of annexin II appears instrumental early in the infection process. To confirm that disconnecting the HIV-annexin II bond inhibits the virus Figure 4 . Annexin II as a cofactor in HIV infection. (A) Adherent macrophages in 48-well plates were treated or not with 25 g/ml anti-annexin II for 60 min at 37ЊC before infection with M tropic HIV-1 BaL for 2 h, the unbound virus was washed away, and the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Every 2-3 d, aliquots of supernatants were removed, replaced with fresh medium, and tested for HIV-1 p24 antigen. (B) Macrophages, treated or not with anti-annexin, IgG, or SLPI for 60 min, were infected with HIV-1 and 14-d supernatants were tested for p24. A representative experiment (n ϭ 4) is shown. (C) SiRNA sequences 1, 2, and control (cSi) were transfected into monocytes using the Amaxa Nucleofector kit, in parallel with an electroporation control (EP) and an untreated control (Ctrl). The cells were incubated 6 d before analysis of annexin protein by Western (inset) and infection with HIV-1. Supernatants were assayed for HIV-1 p24 10 d after infection (n ϭ 5). (D) Macrophages treated with siRNA as indicated in C were analyzed for annexin II, CD4, and CCR5 protein by Western blot. (E) Macrophages were treated with anti-annexin II, infected with HIV-1 JRCSF (JRC; TCID50 ϭ 250/ml), ADA (TCID50 ϭ 10,000/ml), or primary isolate Clade B 92US712 (TCID50 ϭ 1,000/ml), washed, and cultured, with supernatants collected for p24 ELISA every 2-3 d for 12 d. (F) PHA-blasted T cells were treated with anti-annexin II or isotype IgG before infection with T cell tropic HIV IIIB. P24 levels on day 7 are shown. life cycle after HIV-1 binding but before reverse transcription, as shown for SLPI (3), macrophages were infected with or without annexin II inhibitors and the formation of nascent viral DNA was assessed using a nested PCR-based assay. The presence of anti-annexin II during the initial virus inoculation period dramatically inhibited subsequent viral DNA synthesis, as demonstrated by the HIV-1-specific 730-bp PCR product (Fig. 5 E) , even though annexin II blockade did not disengage the viral-binding step (Fig. 5 C) . Collectively, these data indicate that interference with macrophage membrane annexin II inhibits infectivity after binding, but pre-reverse transcription, consistent with a stranglehold on the viral entry/fusion step.
In this study, we identify annexin II as a novel macrophage membrane-binding protein for the innate host defense protein, SLPI, by multiple parameters including im-munoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, peptide sequencing, and binding specificity. Striking was the ability of inhibitors of annexin II to mimic the kinetics and apparent mechanism of HIV-1 suppression by SLPI, denoting a shared site of action. Although not ruling out additional binding targets for SLPI, annexin II appears to be significant in mediating its anti-HIV-1 activity. Subsequent to binding of HIV-1 to the canonical receptors, CD4 and CCR5, HIV-1 fuses with the host cell membrane that might be facilitated by viral envelope PS (14) . PS is not encoded by HIV-1, but rather is acquired from its host cell membrane as it exits the cells (26) . During viral assembly at the cell surface or within cytoplasmic vesicles, cell membrane components become incorporated into the new viral coat along with virally encoded gp120/gp41. The resulting mosaic HIV-1 envelope represents a lipid bilayer with a unique cholesterol/phospholipid composition, embracing viral and host molecules, including PS. Although PS enhances infection, it does not mediate initial binding of the virus to the target cells (14), Figure 5 . Virus binding to annexin II. (A) Nunc immunoplates were coated with the indicated proteins overnight at 4ЊC, washed, and 100 l HIV-1 (10 4 /ml) was added for 1 h at 4ЊC. After six PBS washes, adherent virions were lysed and p24 was measured. Data represent mean and SEM (n ϭ 2). (B) HIV-1 was preincubated with excess soluble annexin II tetramer for 1 h before addition to macrophage cultures. After 2 h of coculture, nonadherent virus was removed, macrophages were cultured, and day 10 supernatants were assayed for p24 levels. (C) After treatment with anti-annexin II (␣Ann II), IgG, or SLPI for 30 min, macrophages were washed and HIV BaL was added for 30 min at 37ЊC. The cells were immediately washed and lysed, and bound p24 was assayed by ELISA. (D) Confocal microscope images (mid-cell single xy sections) of macrophages and apoptotic Jurkat cells, fixed 10 min into the process of phagocytosis. Jurkat cells were stained with the viable dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (green) and macrophages were incubated with mouse anti-annexin II followed by Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (red), demonstrating annexin II staining within the phagosome membrane (arrows). (E) Nested PCR detecting proviral DNA on days 2 and 3 after HIV-1 infection in macrophages treated with DMEM (HIV), antiannexin II, or isotype control IgG. Control represents uninfected cells. consistent with our observations that neither soluble annexin II, RNAi, anti-annexin II, nor the annexin II ligand, SLPI, blocks HIV-1 binding, but rather inhibit postbinding and pre-reverse transcription, a point in the viral life cycle consistent with a proposed role for annexin II as a cellular fusogenic cofactor.
Annexin II reportedly is found in caveolae and lipid rafts in association with cholesterol (27) and mediates interactions between cholesterol-rich membrane domains and the actin cytoskeleton (28, 29) , which may navigate HIV-1 through the labyrinth of the cell membrane. Our data favor a model in which PS in the viral coat interacts with annexin II on the surface of macrophages subsequent to recognitionspecific gp120 interactions with CD4 and the chemokine coreceptors that instigate coiled coil exposure of gp41 fusion domains to interact with the lipid bilayer of the target cell (10, 30) , and then engage an annexin II-dependent fusion/entry pathway leading to productive infection.
Annexin II may represent a molecular pathway exploited by HIV-1 unique to macrophage hosts and thus, a potential target to block their virus susceptibility. Both laboratoryadapted and clinical M tropic isolates appear to coopt this host cell bridge into the cell's interior. Whether annexin II selectively boosts the viral entry/fusion process or possibly also influences pathways involved in HIV-1-mediated macrophage signaling, viral DNA transport, or subsequent virion construction, budding and release remains to be deciphered. Annexin II has the potential to traverse into intracellular compartments and interaction of annexin II with the actin cytoskeleton may not only facilitate internalization, but also the trafficking of HIV-1 within the cell and/or represent the scaffolding for viral transcription (30) . Nonetheless, our data support a dominant role of annexin II to be in the early steps of the infection process, preceding reverse transcription. Annexin II may represent one of multiple potential cofactors, such as syndecan and human neutrophil elastase (31, 32) , which independently or collaboratively might be usurped by HIV-1 to facilitate the infectious process. Because annexin II is a membrane-associated protein, best known as a docking station for tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen (16) , it is unclear if it transduces a signal because it lacks a hydrophobic signal sequence, but conceivably, may serve as an adaptor in a signaling cascade. Annexin II can be phosphorylated at key residues by several kinases, including the src oncogene (17) and Pyk-2 (15), a tyrosine kinase activated by HIV-1 (33, 34) , but such a pathway awaits delineation. Although less persuasive due to the temporal association of SLPI/anti-annexin II inhibition with preintegration events, SLPI may also influence NF-B activation and/or proteasome inhibition (6, 8) , both of which are requisite in an optimal infection process (35) (36) (37) .
Whether the relative lack of abundance of annexin II on the perimeter of immature blood monocytes compared with mature macrophages influences their differential permissiveness to HIV-1 infection is of interest. A related, intriguing question is whether the viral tropism characteristic of T cell and macrophage targets bears any association with their divergent annexin II expression. Annexin II on mac-rophages may preferentially facilitate entry of virions expressing PS acquired during exit from prior macrophage hosts or from T cells undergoing apoptosis that only then express PS on their outer membrane leaflet (38, 39) , as compared with virions budded from PS-less viable T cells. R5 viruses mediate both mucosal and blood-borne transmission of HIV-1 infection, whereas the X4 (T tropic) viruses typically abound in the later stages of disease during clinical progression to AIDS (11, 40, 41) . Moreover, when infected T cells succumb to apoptosis, recognition of their newly exposed PS will pr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mote clearance by annexin IIbearing macrophages with the potential for HIV-1 transfer (42) . It is conceivable that PS-annexin II interactions in the cytoplasmic vesicles and late endosomes of macrophages, where structural assembly of virions occurs (12, 43) and annexin II is found (28) , not only serve as a construction scaffolding, but also as a tether to retain virions intracellularly in a covert maneuver to avoid detection at the cell surface. Because the S100A10 component of the annexin II complex has been shown to facilitate arbovirus exocytosis (44), such a role in HIV-1 egress might also be considered. Annexin II/PS may also contribute to the host cell-derived cloak of the hypothetical Trojan exosomes that subversively deliver retroviral particles to nearby cells (45) , thus a co-conspirator with HIV-1 both going in and coming out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The identification of a novel role for annexin II as a cellular cofactor in HIV-1 entry/fusion has implications for specific antiviral strategies, albeit primarily targeting macrophage infection. Nonetheless, as macrophages may contribute to initial viral selection, dissemination, and transmission of virus to CD4 ϩ T cells, and serve as long-term covert reservoirs of HIV-1 (11,40, 46) , this would be an enviable goal. Particularly evident is the enormous viral burden in macrophages in later stage HIV-1/AIDS during opportunistic infections (12,21, 22) . Further unraveling of the complex interplay between viral envelope and macrophage membrane constituents remains crucial to the development of antiviral agents active before permanent viral integration into the host cell genome when the virus is most vulnerable. The persistence of HIV-1 infection, coupled with its incredible mutation rate and insular reservoirs, focuses attention on host cell constituents usurped by the virus as potential intervention targets. In this regard, annexin II, a host cell molecule that the virus has appropriated for easing its entrance into the host cell, represents a likely candidate, and SLPI, an endogenous ligand for annexin II, or other annexin II-specific blockades, may represent a therapeutic impediment to the infection process. Clearly, viral pathogens other than HIV-1, including CMV and respiratory syncytial virus (19, 20) , also take advantage of target cell annexin II to enhance their infectivity and/or dissemination, and furthermore, bacteria trigger annexin II recruitment to their attachment sites (27) , all suggesting its broader involvement in microbial entrance and pathogenesis. ter) for helpful advice and support.

The mutants included proline substitutions at HA2 55, 71, and 80, as well as a double proline substitution at residues 55 and 71. Mutants were expressed in COS or 293T cells and assayed for cell surface expression and structural features as well as for their ability to change conformation and induce fusion at low pH. We found the following: Specific mutations affected the precise carbohydrate structure and folding of the HA trimer. All of the mutants, however, formed trimers that could be expressed at the cell surface in a form that could be proteolytically cleaved from the precursor, HA0, to the fusion-permissive form, HA1-S-S-HA2. All mutants reacted with an antibody against the major antigenic site and bound red blood cells. Seven out of ten mutants displayed a wild-type (wt) or moderately elevated pH dependence for the conformational change. V55P displayed a substantial reduction ( ‫ف‬ 60-80%) in the initial rate of lipid mixing. The other single mutants displayed efficient fusion with the same pH dependence as wt-HA. The double proline mutant V55P/ S71P displayed no fusion activity despite being well expressed at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved trimer that could bind red blood cells and change conformation at low pH. The impairment in fusion for both V55P and V55P/S71P was at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing. We interpret our results in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for fusion.

9,d1268a2b5aa5778f15fbd10152728dc936a6809e,"Single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) are ubiquitous RNA elements that serve diverse functional roles. Much of our understanding of ssRNA conformational behavior is limited to structures in which ssRNA directly engages in tertiary interactions or is recognized by proteins. Little is known about the structural and dynamic behavior of free ssRNAs at atomic resolution. Here, we report the collaborative application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to characterize the 12 nt ssRNA tail derived from the prequeuosine riboswitch. NMR carbon spin relaxation data and residual dipolar coupling measurements reveal a flexible yet stacked core adopting an A-form-like conformation, with the level of order decreasing toward the terminal ends. An A-to-C mutation within the polyadenine tract alters the observed dynamics consistent with the introduction of a dynamic kink. Pre-ordering of the tail may increase the efficacy of ligand binding above that achieved by a random-coil ssRNA. The REMD simulations recapitulate important trends in the NMR data, but suggest more internal motions than inferred from the NMR analysis. Our study unmasks a previously unappreciated level of complexity in ssRNA, which we believe will also serve as an excellent model system for testing and developing computational force fields.","Single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), typically located at the ends of RNA hairpins and consisting of more than three unpaired residues, serve diverse structural and functional roles. They can fold onto neighboring RNA hairpins to form pseudoknots, essential architectural RNA elements involved in ribosomal frameshifting (1, 2) , hepatitis C internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) recognition (3, 4) and telomerase activity (5) . Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation is prevented or promoted by 3 0 addition of a polyadenylated tail, which recruits essential protein cofactors (6) . Cleavage of the 5 0 transfer RNA (tRNA) leader by RNase P is a key step in tRNA maturation (7) . In riboswitches, ssRNA links the ligand-binding aptamer domain to the expression platform, providing the basis for communication between the two (8) (9) (10) .
Much of our understanding of the conformational behavior of ssRNA comes from high-resolution NMR and X-ray structures of RNA, in which ssRNA directly engages in tertiary or RNA-protein interactions. However, the atomic-level structural and dynamic behavior of these elements in the absence of these interactions remains unclear, in large part due to their high degree of flexibility. Several studies suggest that ssRNA polynucleotides adopt stacked and partially helical conformations, particularly adenine-rich sequences; however, the biological relevance of these structures is unclear (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Atomic-resolution studies of ssRNA are scarce: at present only one isosequential ssRNA and ssDNA sequence has been characterized by homonuclear NMR methods and shown to possess properties reminiscent of A-form and B-form helices, respectively (18) . Few MD studies have been performed on ssRNA, the majority of which use the AMBER force field (19, 20) to explore the impact of chemical modifications such as peptide nucleic acids (PNA) and O2 0 -methylation (21) (22) (23) (24) .
The class I prequeuosine riboswitch (queC), typically found in firmicute bacterial species, is commonly located in the 5 0 -untranslated region (UTR) of the queCDEF operon, which expresses proteins directly involved in the queuosine biosynthetic pathway (25) . The aptamer binds preQ 1 , an intermediate in queuosine synthesis, with high affinity to attenuate protein expression at either the transcription or translation level (25) . This class has the smallest minimal aptamer domain (34 nucleotides, nt) discovered to date, consisting of a small hairpin followed by a 12 nt ssRNA tail ( Figure 1A ). Upon ligand recognition, the highly conserved adenine-rich tail condenses into a pseudoknot, forming a host of interactions to both the hairpin and ligand, including A-minor 'kissing' interactions between the ssRNA polyadenine tract and the minor groove (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . The activity of transcriptionregulating riboswitches, such as the Bacillus subtilis queC riboswitch, has been shown to depend on the kinetics of ligand binding as well as the rate of transcription (8) . Notably, the very small size of the queC riboswitch leaves very little time, in comparison to other switches, for ligand binding to take place prior to formation of the anti-terminator helix which, when formed, prevents terminator helix formation, thereby allowing gene expression to continue. For example, the B. subtilis FMN riboswitch, which is highly dependent upon the rate of polymerase and contains sites that locally pause polymerase to lengthen the ligand-binding window, has $70 nt between the minimal aptamer sequence and complete formation of the anti-terminator helix (8) . In comparison, the ligand-binding window for the queC riboswitch is $20 nt (26, 27) . How efficient ligand binding is achieved is unclear given that the ssRNA tail is thought to be highly disordered, and therefore capable of sampling a wide range of competing conformations.
Here, we use NMR chemical shifts, spin relaxation, and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) in conjunction with REMD simulations using the recently updated CHARMM27 nucleic acid force field (31, 32) to explore the conformational properties of the 12 nt ssRNA tail from the queC aptamer domain and the impact of a single A-to-C mutation targeting the polyadenine tract. Our study unmasks a previously unappreciated level of complexity in ssRNA and suggests that these structures can serve as excellent model systems for testing and developing computational force fields.
Uniformly 13 C/ 15 N-labeled queC36 and C14U/C17U constructs were prepared by in vitro transcription as described previously (33) . Unlabeled wild-type (WT, 5 0 -AUAAAAAACUAA-3 0 ) and A29C (5 0 -AUAACAAA CUAA-3 0 ) RNAs were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and purified using a C18 column (Waters) followed by lyophilization and reconstitution in NMR buffer (15 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.4; 25 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 10% D 2 O by volume. 100% D 2 O samples were prepared by repeatedly lyophilizing the sample and replacing with 99.99% pure D 2 O (Sigma) three times. RNA concentrations ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 mM. AMP, UMP and CMP (Sigma) were directly dissolved into NMR buffer with no additional purification to 5 mM. For RDC measurements, samples were dialyzed into Millipore-purified ddH 2 O using 1 kDa dialysis tubing (Spectrum Labs), lyophilized, and reconstituted into 52.4 mg/ml Pf1 phage solution (34) (35) (36) in NMR buffer with 100% D 2 O (Asla Biotech). RNA concentrations in Pf1 phage ranged from 1.5 to 2 mM.
UV/Vis melting RNA samples (0.25-0.5 mM) were prepared in NMR buffer and the melting profiles measured between 275 K and 368 K using a Varian Bio 300 UV/Vis instrument equipped with a Cary Temperature Controller. The absorbance at 260 nm was recorded every 0.5 with a ramp rate of 0.5 /min. The two-state helix to coil melting transition was analyzed using
where A is the absorbance value at a given temperature T, A H is the absorbance of the fully helical ssRNA, A C is the absorbance of the fully random coil ssRNA, ÁS and ÁH are the entropy and enthalpy of the melting transition respectively, and R is the gas constant (37, 38) . Absorbance values were fitted to the above equation using the non-linear least squares fitting function in Origin 7 to determine thermodynamic parameters. The melting temperature (T m ) was determined by dividing the enthalpy by the entropy.
All NMR experiments were performed on a Avance Bruker 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance 5-mm cryogenic probe. NOESY experiments were performed at 277 K and 298 K using a mixing time of 350 ms (39) . 13 C spin relaxation experiments were performed at natural abundance and 298 K (40) . Relative order parameters were calculated by normalizing (2R 2 -R 1 ) to either A31 (C8) or C33 (C6). Relaxation parameters were computed using HydroNMR (41, 42) , assuming an idealized A-form structure, to obtain diffusion tensor parameters (t m and D ratio ), and in-house written software was used to compute R 2 /R 1 values as previously reported (33, 40) . Motionally averaged bond lengths of 1.104 Å were used for both C8 and C6 moieties as previously described (40, 43) . The following experimentally derived CSAs (s xx , s yy , s zz ) were used in the analysis: (89, 15, À104); (80, 5, À85); and (98.4, 9.2, À107.5) for C2, C8 and C6 moeties (43, 44) . IP-COSY experiments were performed at 277 K and 298 K to observe relative 3 J H1 0 -H2 0 scalar coupling crosspeak intensities (45) . Base and sugar 1 H-13 C splittings were measured from the difference between the upfield and downfield components of the 1 H-13 C doublet along the 1 H component using the narrow transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) component in the 13 C dimension as implemented in 2D 1 H-13 C S 3 CT-heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments (46) . 2 H splittings were 71 and 69 Hz for WT and A29C, respectively. Idealized A-form structures were constructed using Insight II (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) correcting the propeller twist angles from +15 to À15 using an in-house program, as previously described (47) . The complementary strand was removed and the resulting ssRNA used in NMR data analysis. B-form helices were constructed using W3DNA (48) .
Simulation. REMD simulations were performed with the CHARMM simulation package (49) using the recently updated CHARMM27 nucleic acid force field (31, 32) and the MMTSB (50) tool set. Each REMD simulation comprised 40 replicas exponentially distributed over a temperature range from 278 K to 330 K, resulting in an average exchange acceptance ratio of 30%. Each replica was first equilibrated for 0.5 ns, restraining nucleotide heavy atoms, and subsequently run without any restraints for 10 ns, with exchange moves attempted every 0.5 ps.
Both WT and A29C RNAs were initially built in an ideal A-form helical configuration and served as the starting conformation in every simulation of REMD. The RNA was solvated in an 80-Å cubic box of pre-equilibrated TIP3P water (approximately 50 000 atoms). Twelve pairs of sodium chloride with an additional 11 sodium ions were added to the box, corresponding to the experimental ionic concentration of 40 mM.
Analysis. We utilized the last 5 ns of the REMD trajectory at 298 K for the following analysis. Base stacking energies were defined as the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energies between the adjacent bases. The molecular orientation was expressed by the order parameters S 2 of the C-H bond vectors employing the model-free approach of Lipari and Szabo (51) . After a translational and rotational fit of each RNA snapshot to the ideal A-form helical structure, the order parameters were taken from the plateau phase of the correlation function, given by
where P 2 is the second order Legendre polynomial and * is the unit vector along the C-H dipole. Additionally, from the atomic coordinates we constructed the RDC values by first orienting an idealized A-form ssRNA helix into the principal axis system determined from the order tensor analysis of the experimental RDCs. Each frame of the trajectory was superimposed with this ideal helix followed by calculating the average of , 3 cos 2 À1 D E , where is the angle between a given bond vector (e.g. C1 0 H1 0 ) and the z-axis. The RDC values were then scaled by À82/r 3 , in which r is the C-H bond length and a factor of À82 is applied to shift the computed RDCs to the same scale as the NMR values. The average structure of the ssRNA was calculated as the structure with the minimal root-mean-square deviations from all RNA conformations in the 5 ns REMD trajectory.
Previous studies have shown that in the absence of ligand, the queC aptamer domain folds into a non-native hairpin, in which the 5 0 -strand frame-shifts to allow the first two guanine residues to base pair, with the 12 nt ssRNA tail lacking any tertiary interactions (26) . The 2D C-H NMR spectra of the 36 nt queC minimal aptamer domain ( Figure 1A ), in the absence of ligand, show severe resonance overlap and large variations in resonance intensities indicating a highly disordered conformation ( Figure 1B ). Excess imino proton resonances as well as 1 H-15 N NOE data indicate that the unbound queC aptamer domain is in equilibrium between native and non-native hairpin conformations (data not shown), consistent with previous NMR studies (26) .
The NMR spectra suggest that the unbound 36 nt queC minimal aptamer domain is highly disordered and that the ssRNA tail is not involved significantly in any tertiary interactions. To test this hypothesis further, we compared NMR spectra of the isolated 12 nt ssRNA tail with the corresponding spectra of the unbound queC aptamer. Remarkably, NMR spectra of the isolated 12 nt ssRNA tail overlay almost perfectly with the queC aptamer domain and specifically onto the highly intense resonances corresponding to highly disordered residues ( Figure 1B ). The only significant deviations are observed for A25 and U26, which are located at the junction site between the hairpin and the tail ( Figure 1B ). This indicates that in the absence of ligand, the ssRNA tail is not involved in any significant tertiary interactions under the NMR conditions (1 mM RNA, 25 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 298 K).
Similarly to the Fusobacterium nucleatum queC riboswitch, the B. subtilis queC aptamer forms kissing dimers, as observed in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Supplementary Figure S1 ) (52) . To ensure that the dimer does not obstruct hairpin-tail interactions, we compared a mutant C14U/C17U construct characterized previously by Kang and coworkers to generate a ligandbound solution NMR structure (26) to the WT aptamer. MFold predicts the C14U/C17U mutations will reduce the dimer stability from À6.1 kcal/mol to À0.9 kcal/mol (53). While we observe removal of the kissing dimer, chemical shifts overall overlay extremely well between the WT queC aptamer and the C14U/C17U mutant (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Specifically, tail chemical shifts correspond extremely well to the 12 nt ssRNA, further suggesting that the tail does not participate in tertiary interactions in the absence of ligand under our NMR conditions. Strikingly, the spectra of the 12 nt ssRNA are well resolved, indicating that it does not adopt a completely random conformation ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2 ). This stands in stark contrast to corresponding spectra of a 12 nt polyuridine (polyU) ssRNA, well established to have a random-coil conformation (16) , which exhibits severe spectral overlap indicative of a highly disordered conformation (Supplementary Figure S2) . This structural order is observed in the ssRNA despite the lack of any observable imino protons and therefore any base pairing or secondary structure (Supplementary Figure S3) .
The 2D 1 H-1 H NOESY spectrum of the ssRNA shows abundant nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities expected for a helical conformation, allowing the near complete assignment of base and sugar (H1 0 ) protons at 298 K (Supplementary Figure S3) . Particularly noteworthy are inter-base NOEs observed between adenine H8 protons within the polyadenine tract and between C33-U34 H6 protons, indicating significant base stacking within the polyadenine core at 277 K and decreased at 298 K (Supplementary Figure S3) (54) . Sequential NOEs are only observed for A25, U26, A35, and A36 upon decreasing the temperature from 298 K to 277 K, indicating a higher level of disorder at the terminal ends ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S3 ). Furthermore, homonuclear three bond scalar couplings ( 3 J H1 0 -H2 0 ) indicate that residues within the polyadenine core adopt a C3 0 -endo sugar pucker conformation, consistent with an A-form-like geometry, with the tendency to adopt alternative sugar pucker conformations increasing towards terminal residues (Supplementary Figure S2) .
NMR chemical shifts are extremely sensitive probes of the local electronic environment for a given bond vector and can provide useful structural information (55) (56) (57) (58) . Highly disordered residues are expected to have chemical shifts similar to nucleotide monophosphates (NMPs). While the chemical shifts of terminal residues are similar to their NMP analogs, increasing differences are observed when approaching the polyadenine core with the greatest differences observed for A30-32 (Supplementary Figure S2 ). The directionality of the chemical shifts is consistent with increased formation of stacking interactions towards the center of the tail (57) . This is further supported by chemical shift perturbations in a trajectory toward the NMPs with increasing temperature (data not shown). Alternatively, addition of magnesium up to 4 mM results in slight chemical shift perturbations farther from NMPs, consistent with previous studies suggesting that increases in ionic strength stabilize ssRNA stacking interactions (59) (data not shown). In contrast polyU has near-identical ( 0.1 ppm) chemical shifts to UMP (Supplementary Figure S2) . Thus, consistent with NOE data, the chemical shift data suggest a comparatively stacked core with a growing level of disorder towards the terminal ends. Normalized resonance intensities (33) further support these observations, which gradually increase towards the terminal ends, consistent with a higher level of pico-to nanosecond motions (Supplementary Figure S2) .
The abundance of NOEs indicates significant base stacking interactions, which likely contribute to ordering of the tail. To probe the thermodynamic stability of the tail, we performed UV/Vis melting experiments to determine the melting temperature of the helix to coil transition. Consistent with previous studies of single-stranded nucleic acids, the melting profile of the ssRNA is extremely broad, characteristic of a non-cooperative transition (Figure 2A ) (37) . Previous studies of a 7 nt polyadenine ssRNA in similar buffer conditions yield analogous melting temperatures to those observed ($35 C compared to 31.7 ± 1.90 C) (37) .
We then used our REMD simulations to explore the temperature dependence of base stacking compared to the described UV/Vis melting curves. Base stacking energies from the REMD simulation between temperatures 278-330 K show a similar gradual decrease with increasing temperature and a similar, although reduced, T m value (experimental 31.7 ± 1.90 C compared to computed 20-25 C, as estimating the T 50 value from melting curve, Figure 2A) . However, the calculated base stacking energy plateaus around 320 K while the experimental slope begins to plateau around 330 K, indicating that stacking energies may be under-estimated in the REMD simulation or that additional unaccounted-for factors contribute to the ssRNA stability. Nevertheless, our data suggest that base stacking is the guiding force behind ssRNA stability, consistent with previous studies.
To gain further insights into the dynamic properties of the ssRNA at pico-to nanosecond timescales, we measured longitudinal (R 1 ) and transverse (R 2 ) carbon relaxation data for the nucleobases (C2 C6 C8) using 2D 13 C relaxation R 1 and R 1r NMR experiments (40) , where R 1 and R 2 values are determined using in-house software (Supplementary Figure S4) . These measurements represent the first nucleobase 13 C relaxation measurements performed on a ssRNA. The measured R 1 and R 2 values were used to compute order parameters (51) using S 2 = (2R 2 -R 1 ) (60), and normalized to yield a relative order parameter (S 2 rel ) describing the relative degree of order within a molecule ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 and 1 represent minimum and maximum order, respectively. The S 2 rel values were normalized against central residues A31 (C8) and C33 (C6). Resonance overlap prevented the normalization of C2 spins. Again, we observe a gradual reduction in S 2 rel indicating higher levels of disorder moving from central polyadenine residues (A28-C33) towards the terminal ends ( Figure 2B ).
We also computed the S 2 rel values based on the REMD simulation described above. The REMD simulations reproduce the general trends observed in the experiments; however, the simulations show significantly increased dynamics at the terminal ends compared to experimental values, with S 2 rel values approaching the dynamic limit ( Figure 2B ). Additionally, while experimental values have similar relative order parameters from A28-C33, large variations are observed in the REMD simulation, with A29-A30 being more ordered and A32 less ordered than experimentally observed ( Figure 2B ). These differences may reflect shortcomings in the force field and/or mismatch in the experimental/computational timescales since the REMD simulations likely probe fluctuations that extend beyond the picosecond timescales sensed by spin relaxation data.
The high level of disorder and motional coupling in the ssRNA prevents quantitative analysis of relaxation data using the model-free formalism, which assumes that internal and overall motions are decoupled from one another (51) . This makes it difficult if not impossible to assess the absolute level of disorder in the ssRNA; one can only make qualitative assessments about the relative disorder across different residues. However, it is noteworthy that even the comparatively high R 2 /R 1 values measured in the rigid core ($2.9, Figure 2C ) remain significantly lower than values predicted for a perfectly rigid helical ssRNA ($6.4, Supplementary Figure S4 ) as estimated using the program HYDRONMR (41, 42) . If we assume an overall diffusion tensor predicted by HYDRONMR, we find that central polyadenine residues are highly flexible with an estimated average NMR spin relaxation order parameter S 2 of $0.45 ( Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S4) . Interestingly, similar though slightly smaller absolute S 2 values are calculated from the REMD simulations (on average S 2 $ 0.36 for core residues, Figure 2D ). These data indicate that despite measurable stacking interactions and a helical-like average conformation, the polyadenine core is highly disordered with residues experiencing fluctuations on the order of a ±40 cone angle (61) at pico-to nanosecond timescales.
To further probe the conformation of the ssRNA and extend the NMR timescale sensitivity to milliseconds, we measured RDCs (62,63) using 52.4 mg/ml Pf1 phage as an ordering medium. While most RNAs align optimally in $25 mg/ml of phage, a much higher concentration of phage was used for the ssRNA to ensure optimal alignment. To our knowledge, these are the first RDC measurements reported on a single-stranded nucleic acid. The RDCs measured between two nuclei depend on 3 cos 2 À1 2 D E , where is the angle between the inter-nuclear vector and the magnetic field and the angular bracket denotes a timeaverage over all orientations sampled at sub-millisecond timescales (62, 63) . RDCs were measured for base C5H5, C6H6, C8H8, C2H2 and sugar C1 0 H1 0 moieties (47) .
In general, isotropic motions tend to reduce the observed RDC value, approaching zero at the limit of spatially unrestricted isotropic motions (61, 64, 65) . In the ssRNA, large base C-H RDCs are measured in the polyadenine tract residues that gradually decrease at the termini ( Figure 3A ). Although small RDC values can also arise from static placement of the bond vector near the magic angle relative to the principal direction of order, the overall trends observed are consistent with NMR chemical shift and S 2 rel data suggesting that the RDCs indicate increased dynamic averaging at the termini ( Figure 3A) . Interestingly, the near-zero RDCs measured at terminal residues ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S5 ) agree more closely to the REMD simulations compared to the S 2 rel values, indicating that the discrepancy between the measured and computed S 2 rel values may be due to truncation of the S 2 sensitivity to motions faster than nanoseconds. These results add to a growing number of NMR studies on different types of RNA showing that RDC data are capable of probing motions that are incompletely sensed by spin relaxation due to truncation of the time-sensitivity by overall correlation time of the molecule (64, (66) (67) (68) . Unfortunately, severe spectral overlap, particularly pronounced in the Pf1 phage sample, prevented measurement of several C1 0 H1 0 RDCs for the polyadenine core.
We subjected the RDCs (excluding RDCs for the two flexible residues from the terminal ends) to an order tensor analysis (47, 69, 70) assuming different input structures including single strands derived from idealized A-form and B-form helices, the REMD-averaged structure, and available ligand-bound X-ray and NMR structures (26, 27) . Despite the relatively small number of RDCs used in this analysis, we clearly observe a better fit with an A-form geometry (Q-factor 4.77%) as compared to all other conformations (Q-factor ! 16%) ( Figure 3B ). This is consistent with independently observed 3 J H1 0 -H2 0 scalar coupling crosspeaks, which indicate a C3 0 -endo sugar conformation for core residues in the tail, suggesting an A-form (and not B-form) helical geometry. The RDCs are in strong disagreement with preQ 1 -bound X-ray and NMR structures (PDBID: 3FU2 and 2L1V) indicating that the tail must undergo a transition from an A-form helical geometry towards the distinct helical conformation observed in the X-ray and NMR structures in which the A-form geometry is perturbed at the hairpin-tail junction, likely due to torsional strain from the ssRNA folding back upon the hairpin. The REMD-averaged structure has a Q-factor of 30%, indicating a better fit than ligand-bound structures, but is still outside the range considered to represent a good fit. Together, these data suggest that, on average, the ssRNA tail adopts an A-form like conformation. The good RDC fit to the A-form structure also suggests that averaging of the RDCs due to internal motions is largely isotropic in nature, causing a semi-uniform attenuation of the RDCs relative to values expected for an A-form structure. The dynamics could involve exchange between a stacked ordered conformation and unstacked highly disordered conformation, or local isotropic motions about the average A-form conformation.
As a further check on the accuracy of the A-form structure, we compared the principal direction of alignment (S zz ) determined experimentally using RDCs assuming a ssRNA A-form structure with the orientation predicted by PALES (71) using a ssRNA A-form structure. Surprisingly, we find that the experimentally determined S zz deviates from the helix axis by $19.8 ( Figure 3C ). Interestingly, PALES predicts a principal direction of order that deviates from the helix axis by 14.4 ; the S zz orientation predicted using PALES is in good agreement from that measured experimentally (deviation $ 5 ). The deviation from the helix axis can be attributed to the absence of the complementary strand, resulting in an overall shape with a long axis that is not coincident with the helical axis, as reported previously for a quadruplex DNA topology (72) .
To further test the conformational distribution from the REMD simulations, we used a number of simplifying assumptions to compute RDCs from the REMD trajectory. Snapshots from the REMD simulations were superimposed onto an idealized A-form helix oriented in the principal axis system determined using the experimental RDCs and the order tensor fit. RDCs were then arbitrarily scaled by À82/r 3 , in which r is the C-H bond length and accounts for bond length variations during the dynamics. We find excellent agreement between experimental and computed nucleobase RDCs; however, computed C1 0 H1 0 RDCs fail to reproduce observed RDCs, particularly for A32: while the magnitude is similar (18 Hz compared to À30 Hz) the sign differs, suggesting the orientation of the C1 0 H1 0 bond vector differs between experiment and simulation (Supplementary Figure S5) . C1 0 H1 0 RDCs are generally opposite in sign to base RDCs in a double-stranded A-form helix. However, back-calculated C1 0 H1 0 RDCs from the order tensor analysis assuming a ssRNA A-form helix are positive in sign, suggesting the C1 0 H1 0 orientation in the REMD simulations deviates from an A-form structure (Supplementary Figure S5) .
Taken together, the data show that the polyadenine tract is relatively ordered at 298 K, with a gradual reduction in order approaching the termini and that the base stacking interactions are the guiding force behind this order. To determine whether disrupting the polyadenine tract will destabilize the global structure, we substituted A29 within the polyadenine tract with a cytosine residue (referred to as A29C). Other types of mutations involving placements of uridine were not explored as these were expected to yield partially base paired conformations. As with the WT construct, we observed no imino protons, indicating the absence of any detectable base pairing and secondary structure (Supplementary Figure S7) . The 2D C-H spectra for the A29C mutant remain highly disperse, and the chemical shift perturbations relative to WT are clustered around the site of mutation (A28 and A30) ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S6) . However, small but significant chemical shift perturbations relative to WT are also observed at more distant residues, including A27, A31, C33 and U34. These perturbations diminish when moving away from the center of the ssRNA and are basically absent in the highly flexible terminal residues ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S6 ). Such longer-range perturbations suggest that the mutation may have a long-range effect possibly by influencing the stacking interactions of several nucleobases. A perturbation to stacking interactions is also supported by distinct NOE connectivities in A29C, which show weakened cross peaks to C29, and new crosspeaks between A28 (H2) and A30 (H1 0 ) that indicate C29 partially loops out to allow A28 to stack onto A30 (Supplementary Figure S7) . The melting temperature of the mutant is reduced by $5 C, and the base stacking energies are computed to be $2 kcal/mol lower compared to WT, indicating that the mutation likely destabilizes the stacking interactions (Supplementary Figure S6) .
Interestingly, many of the residues that experience chemical shift perturbations following the A29 to C29 mutation also exhibit a greater degree of dynamics as assessed by normalized resonance peak intensities in 2D C-H HSQC spectra (Supplementary Figure S6 ) and carbon relaxation data (R 1 and R 2 ) ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S8 ). In particular, severe line broadening consistent with a slow exchange process occurring at micro-to millisecond timescales manifesting as reduced resonance intensities in 2D spectra and higher R 2 values is observed for C29 in the A29C mutant ( Supplementary  Figures S6 and S8 ). This is not observed for A29 in WT. Smaller but significant line broadening is also observed for residues A31, A32 and U34 (Supplementary Figure S8 ). This line broadening across several residues may reflect exchange between stacked and unstacked conformations. Higher intensities as well as reduced S 2 rel values are observed for residues A27 and A28, indicating a greater degree of fast pico-to nanosecond dynamics ( Supplementary Figures S6 and S8) . Note that the high R 2 and weak signal intensity leads to a higher error in the R 2 /R 1 measurements, particularly for C29.
Although the A29C RDCs are generally in good agreement with the WT RDCs, variations are observed for a number of residues (U26, A27, A31) that indicate differences in conformation and/or dynamic behavior ( Figure 4C ). Though an order tensor analysis of 13 RDCs shows best agreement with an A-form structure, the quality of the fit is not as good as that observed for WT (Q-factor = 8.77%, Figure 4D ). The S zz direction measured for A29C when assuming an A-form structure deviates substantially from that predicted using PALES ($11 , Supplementary Figure S9 ). These data suggest that A29C deviates from an idealized A-form structure as compared to WT. These deviations may reflect static and/or dynamic bending about the C29 pivot point, possibly arising from looping out of this residue from the helical stack. Such a conformation is observed in the REMD simulations of A29C $1% but not in WT (data not shown).
In general, the REMD simulations predict the NMR data measured for A29C with reduced quality to that noted for WT. Interestingly, the computed absolute S 2 values indicate a global reduction in order for A29C, particularly for residues A27-C33 (Supplementary Figure  S8) , whereas NMR relaxation parameters between WT and A29C are more similar, suggesting comparable global order parameters. The REMD simulations reveal enhanced dynamics at C29 consistent with the NMR chemical exchange data. The REMD simulation also suggests increased dynamics at A32, which is not observed experimentally: although slightly reduced, the S 2 rel is within error of A29-A31 values (S 2 rel of 1) (Supplementary Figure S8) . Computed RDCs agree reasonably with measured RDCs, although the C1 0 H1 0 RDCs are opposite in sign as observed in the comparison between WT NMR and REMD-calculated RDCs. The Q-factor comparing the average REMD structure to measured RDCs is 70%; however, removal of A28 C8H8, A30 C2H2 and A30 C1 0 H1 0 RDCs improves the Q-factor significantly. This improvement is observed only for the REMD structure ( Figure 4D ), indicating that these residues, localized about the mutation site, adopt non-Aform conformations and likely experience perturbati",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ns from the increased dynamics at C29. The difference in timescales between the REMD simulations and NMR may be another factor leading to the observed discrepancies. Nevertheless, MD and NMR data both indicate significant dynamics at the mutation site with perturbations extending toward the 3 0 end of the ssRNA. ssRNA tail conformation and dynamics optimized for ligand docking in queC aptamer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the main questions we set out to explore during the course of our studies was how the queC aptamer manages to efficiently bind its cognate ligand despite the small commitment time available in the kinetic switch and the large conformational space that may be available to a highly disordered ssRNA, which would have to search many competing conformations before arriving at the ligand bound pseudoknot conformation. Our study reveals that the ssRNA is not entirely disordered, but rather, has the character of a stacked A-form-like helical conformation which may effectively reduce the conformational search of the ssRNA, promoting efficient docking onto the hairpin to form the pseudoknot. Moreover, our study uncovers a greater degree of flexibility towards the terminal ends, particularly the 5 0 -end which forms the pivot point for docking the ssRNA tail onto the hairpin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The NMR data clearly show the absence of any pre-existing tertiary interactions involving the ssRNA tail in the unbound queC aptamer domain. This together with our findings regarding the conformational behavior of the unbound ssRNA tail suggests the following model for ligand binding ( Figure 5 ). In the absence of ligand, the ssRNA tail is disordered but on average forms an A-form helix-like conformation, which can efficiently explore conformational space about a highly flexible junction. The ligand may transiently form encounter complexes when the tail is close in space to the P1 hairpin, and possibly with the help of divalent ions such as calcium (27, 73) , triggering the necessary conformational changes required to form the pseudoknot and binding pocket. This finding is consistent with computational modeling of the ligand binding mechanism in which A-minor tertiary interactions form first, followed by pseudoknot formation (30) and may explain the fast ligand binding rate observed in the related F. nucleatum queC riboswitch (52). Our results, including the observation of greater dynamics in the mutant, provide a framework for more rigorous testing of this proposed model with future in vitro and in vivo studies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our study shows that ssRNA can exhibit complex conformational behavior, including variable levels of stacking and propensities to form an A-form helical conformation across the polynucleotide chain, and also, the ability to interrupt stacked residues by introducing sequence-specific kinks and/or distortions. While it has been known for some time that polyadenine stretches tend to stack and form helical conformations (13,14,16,18, 37) , the details of this helical geometry were difficult to decipher based solely on NOE-based NMR data. Our RDC measurements on the ssRNA, together with scalar coupling constant measurements, strongly suggest that the polyadenine tract forms an A-form-like conformation in the WT ssRNA. Our results also unveil dynamic complexity in ssRNA, including a gradual increase in disorder occurring towards the terminal ends that is reminiscent of unfolded polypeptide chains (74) , and also, slower sequence-specific dynamics occurring at micro-to millisecond timescales that may involve transient stacking/unstacking motions that may result in kinking of the ssRNA. Altogether, our studies show that 'structured' ssRNA exhibits exquisite quality spectra and can be studied quantitatively using NMR-based structure and dynamics measurements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The REMD simulations recapitulate many of the key features and trends observed based on the melting and NMR data, including the existence of stacking interactions that are weakened by the A29C mutation, the formation of helical geometry that may be kinked in A29C at the mutation site, and an increase in dynamic disorder towards the terminal ends and localized about C29 in the mutant. However, the REMD simulations showed weaker agreement with sugar RDCs or sugar conformation, particularly in the A29C mutant, and had increased dynamics compared to the NMR data. Prior studies on HIV-1 TAR RNA noted higher levels of dynamics in CHARMM simulations compared to NMR measurements (75) . Our studies indicate that suboptimal base stacking energies may be a source of these excess dynamics. However, a quantitative assessment of the simulations requires the application of domain-elongation methods to rigorously decouple internal and overall motions, and make it possible to quantitatively predict NMR measurements (33, (75) (76) (77) . In addition, MD simulations that retain aspects of time are required to compare the rates of dynamics observed by relaxation and exchange broadening type measurements. The simplicity of ssRNA offers a much needed model system for such studies directed at rigorously examining currently used nucleic acid force fields.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally, our results suggest that the conformational properties of the ssRNA tail are optimized to allow the queC riboswitch to efficiently bind ligands within the short commitment time available to this kinetic switch. In particular, the pre-stacked ssRNA tail can efficiently rotate about a flexible hinge against the hairpin loop, and explore conformational space efficiently for rapid ligand binding. This pre-stacking about dynamic hinges may be a general feature of many ssRNAs that can play different architectural roles in a variety of RNA contexts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,3b19c08ee471af50e75d3d2071699e88990cbe68,"We describe a fatal case of Japanese encephalitis virus infection following short-term travel to Thailand. Viral RNA was detected in urine and whole blood out to 26 and 28 days, respectively, after the onset of symptoms. Live virus was isolated from a urine specimen from day 14.","A previously well 69-year-old Australian man traveled to Thailand in early May 2017. The planned duration of travel was 12 days, and he did not attend a travel clinic prior to departure. The patient did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis, nor did he have a prior history of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccination. He flew to Phuket, before traveling north to the popular tourist destination of Khao Lak, where he stayed in a beachside holiday resort. Heavy rainfall occurred during the trip, which limited holiday activities. He did not travel to rural or remote areas, but did receive numerous mosquito bites. On the eighth day of travel, he became unwell with lethargy and generalized muscle aches. He flew to Bangkok on the ninth day of the trip, and over the following 3 days his symptoms included ongoing lethargy, poor appetite, and drenching sweats, but no headache, meningism, or confusion. He returned to Australia on day 12 of travel and was admitted to a regional hospital the following day, now the fifth day after symptoms commenced ( Figure 1 ).
Shortly after admission, on day 7 of his illness, he became confused. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture demonstrated a glucose of 3.5 mmol/L (reference interval, 2.2-3.9 mmol/L), protein of 1.3 g/L (reference interval < 0.45), polymorphs of 280 × 10^6/L, lymphocytes of 90 × 10^6/L, and red blood cells of 54 × 10^6/L. He was commenced on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, meropenem, benzyl penicillin, and acyclovir. Due to a deteriorating conscious state, he was intubated the following day and transferred to a tertiary center. Neurological examination upon arrival revealed a generalized flaccid paralysis. A magnetic resonance image of the brain demonstrated no abnormalities. Seizure activity developed on day 10 of his illness, for which anticonvulsant medication was commenced.
Diagnostic assays performed on the initial and a repeat CSF (on day 10) were negative using conventional gel-based and realtime multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) for herpes viruses (herpes simplex 1 and 2 and varicella zoster), enterovirus, pan-flavivirus (Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE], Kunjin, dengue, West Nile, Zika, yellow fever, JEV), respiratory viruses (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, picornavirus, adenovirus, coronavirus), meningococcus, and pneumococcus. The conventional pan-flavivirus PCR and JEV real-time PCR performed on plasma were also negative (see the Supplementary Data for detailed methods). HIV and syphilis serology were negative, as were bacterial cultures and screening swabs for Burkholderia pseudomallel.
On the fourteenth day of illness, JEV immunofluorescence serology (Euroimmun) performed in parallel on plasma from day 7, day 12, and day 13 of illness, was positive. The JEV IgG titre increased across the serial bleeds from 160 to 1280 to >2560 (confirmed by neutralization), suggesting recent infection, and JEV IgM was detected in all 3 specimens. Serology performed on CSF from day 10 was also positive for JEV IgM and IgG. The presence of measles IgG in plasma but not CSF was consistent with local production of JEV antibodies in CSF rather than contamination. Serology for MVE (EIA-total antibody) was weakly positive on day 7 but negative on days 12 and 13 and thought to represent nonspecific cross-reactivity. Dengue virus IgM, IgG, and NS1 antigen were not detected.
Given the results of serological testing, serial samples of plasma, whole blood, and urine were tested using the conventional gel based pan-flavivirus PCR and JEV real-time PCR. Notably, both urine and whole blood specimens were found to be persistently positive for JEV (confirmed by sequencing of the NS5 region), while plasma was found to be persistently negative (Figure 1 ). Reproducibility of these findings was confirmed by re-extracting and retesting the 4 most recent urine and whole blood specimens directly from the primary samples, and repeat testing was performed on separate PCR runs. Whole-genome sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Figure 1) identified the isolated JEV strain (VIDRL_JEV aligned) as a member of Genotype I. Our patient's isolate localized within a subclade of viruses isolated from Thailand, geographically aligning with the travel history.
Aliquots of urine and whole blood were inoculated onto cultured cells to assess viral infectivity (see the Supplementary Data for detailed methods). Cytopathic effects were observed 7 days postinoculation from the day 14 urine specimen. The cell culture supernatant was tested by JEV real-time PCR and was found to be positive with a high level of detection, suggesting efficient viral replication.
Japanese encephalitis viral RNA was detected in urine samples out to day 26 after the onset of symptoms and in whole blood up until the final specimen was tested on day 28.
Electromyogram and nerve conduction studies performed on day 22 were consistent with an acute motor-axonal neuropathy or anterior horn cell pathology. No clinical improvement was evident after 4 days of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administered at a dose of 1 g/kg daily, and the patient died 30 days after the onset of symptoms.
Japanese encephalitis virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus endemic in most parts of Asia, where it is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In a 2011 systematic review, it was estimated that 67 900 cases occur annually [1] . The traditional diagnostic paradigm for JEV infection has been based on the understanding that the period of viremia is short-lived, and hence the utility of PCR is limited. As a result, most cases are diagnosed serologically [2] . Serological diagnosis may be complicated by cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses or the need for follow-up samples to look for a rise in antibody titre over time. Here we report prolonged detection of JEV in both urine and whole blood, but not in plasma or CSF samples, which are most commonly tested for diagnostic purposes. If reproducible in other cases, these findings could significantly improve laboratory diagnostics for JEV and provide new insights into the viral dynamics of JEV.
To our knowledge, this is the first reported detection of JEV RNA in whole blood and the first report of JEV isolation in cell culture from urine. This is an interesting finding in light of recent detection of a number of other flaviviruses in urine samples, including Zika, Dengue, and West Nile Virus (WNV) [4] [5] . This is only the second reported case of detection of JEV RNA in urine, with the first reported case initially detected via deep sequencing [6] . We demonstrate prolonged detection of JEV in urine to day 26. These findings are in contrast to a report from China, where JEV RNA was not detected by real-time PCR from the urine of 52 children with serologically confirmed infection [7] . Our experience with a single, possibly exceptional case has been different, and the reasons why are not clear. This might reflect differences in the patients studied, the diagnostic assays employed, or the timing of the urine samples collected. Our PCR assay targeted loci within the NS5 region, in contrast to the consensus NS3 region targeted in the previous report. Alternatively, in the previous report [7] , all urine specimens were collected early on in illness (3-9 days after onset) whereas the first urine specimen tested in our patient was 14 days after the onset of symptoms. In light of previous descriptions of prolonged detection of Dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus from whole blood specimens [3, [8] [9] [10] , we undertook serial testing of whole blood in parallel with testing of plasma. JEV RNA was detectable in whole blood, but not plasma, out to the final specimen tested, 28 days after the onset of illness. Testing of whole blood by PCR has not traditionally been performed due to the potential presence of inhibitors [11] ; however, this report and other recent publications suggest that testing of whole blood may offer additional diagnostic information in certain situations. Notably, West Nile virus has been found to bind to red blood cells (RBCs), and the WNV viral load in RBC components has been found to exceed that in plasma by 1 order of magnitude [12] .
Japanese encephalitis is a rare infection in travelers, with only 79 cases among travelers or expatriates from nonendemic countries reported to the Centers from Disease Control and Prevention from 1973 to 2015 [13] . Vaccination to JEV is generally only recommended to travelers who intend to spend 1 or more months in endemic areas during the transmission season, although consideration may be given to short-term travelers who may be at increased risk of exposure or who plan to travel to an area with an ongoing outbreak [13] . A further notable aspect of our case is acquisition of JEV following shortterm travel to an area that would not normally be considered high risk. Interestingly, in a 2009 review on JEV in travelers, more than half of 21 cases were acquired after short-term travel [14] . Given the improved tolerability of modern vaccine preparations and the potentially devastating consequences of infection, it has been suggested that current vaccination recommendations should be revised to offer vaccination to a broader range of travelers [14] . A short-term traveler who visits JEV endemic areas should be informed about the risk of disease, potential outcomes, and the risks and benefits of JEV vaccination.
In conclusion, this report raises a potential opportunity to widen the diagnostic window for JEV infection. Given the challenges inherent in flavivirus serological diagnosis, especially in the context of lifetime exposures to multiple flaviviruses, a greater capacity for direct virus detection by PCR could be very attractive. Further studies are needed to determine the reproducibility of these findings.

12,a0ee437d7eab376084d070124b4070598480a179,"The aim of the present study was to screen the anti-dengue potential of crude leaf extracts of two plants from Pavetta tomentosa and Tarenna asiatica. For larvicidal assay, the acetone extract of both plants showed maximum effects, with the least LC 50 and LC 90 values (P. tomentosa (5.968 and 7.493 μg/ml) and T. asiatica (1.288 and 1.992 μg/ml)) and the same extract of both plants exhibited better pupicidal potency. The adulticidal activity of both plants (0-60 min interval periods) recorded best results in acetone extracts and the LC 50 and LC 90 values were recorded as P. tomentosa (32.105 and 41.001 μg/ml) and T. asiatica (09.012 and 11.854 μg/ml). Among the two plants P. tomentosa acetone leaf extract have good antiviral property against Dengue viral cell line. In addition, the phytochemical nature of the plant reveals the presence of saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids in all the tested extracts of both plants. GC-MS analysis revealed Hexanedioic acid, Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) Ester (22.54) and 2, 6,10,14,18, 2,6,10, 15, 19,15,19,23-Hexamethyl-(ALL-E)-(25.33) identified as two major phytoconstitutents in P. tomentosa and Tetracontane (23.580) is a major compound identified from T. asiatica acetone extracts. The functional groups of chemical compounds (aromatis, alkanes, alkyls and carboxylic acids) from P. tomentosa and T. asiatica were analyzed by FT-IR spectrum.","Dengue virus is mainly transmitted by female mosquitoes of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, it comprises four distinct serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4) which belong to the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae). Distinct genotypes have been identified within each serotype, highlighted the extensive genetic variability of the dengue serotypes. Among them, World health Organization (2012) reported the ""Asian"" genotypes of DEN-2 and DEN-3 are frequently associated with severe diseases and closed with secondary dengue infections. The World Health Organization estimates that around 50 to 400 million peoples are annually at risk of dengue (WHO, 2015) . The dengue and other infections have been dramatically risen in recent decades, due to increased urbanization, trade and travel etc. No effective drug or vaccine is available so far for control of dengue (Panneerselvam et al., 2012) . Mosquitoes are an important vector that is capable of transmitting potential pathogens to human beings and responsible for several infectious diseases like dengue, zika, filariasis, malaria, yellow fever and chickungunya etc (Nauen, 2007) . They become a challenging issue to public health worldwide, and it has a serious social and economic impact especially in tropical and sub-tropical countries (Bossche and Coetzer, 2008) . In India, for the past two years more than one lakh cases are confirmed with dengue infection.
During the year 2017, National vector borne disease control programme have been reported 11,552 cases dengue affected and 245 people leading to death (NVBDC, 2017) .
The chemicals from plant origin, are now recognized as potent alternative insecticides to replace the synthetic agents for mosquito control programs (Regnault-Roger et al., 2012) . Medicinal plant extracts and their secondary metabolites could not produce any toxic to humans, biodegradable, and potentially suitable for use in the control of mosquito larvae (Govindarajan et al., 2005; Govindarajan and Sivakumar, 2012) . A small group of plants (69 nos) around the world have been reported as the potential antiviral agents especially against the dengue (Kadir et al., 2013) . The natural molecule potential of medicinal plants to fight against Dengue (Suroowan et al., 2016) .
The chosen plants (Pavetta tomentosa and Tarenna asiatica) are shrubby in nature, belongs to family Rubiaceae and distributed in India. In tamil, P. tomentosa called as Kattukkaranai and Karanai, T. asiatica known as Thaerani. P. tomentosa found in terrain and hilly regions with greyish, brown bark, elliptic or oblong-lanceolate, coriaceous leaves, white, fragrant flowers in cymes and black, multi-seeded berries. The plant is used for suppuration in boils and skin diseases (Amutha et al., 2012) . The P. tomentosa bark in decoction or administered pulverized form especially to children for correct visceral obstructions (Kirtikar and Basu, 2003) . The decoctions of leaves are used to alleviate the pains caused by haemorrhoids. The pulverized root of P. tomentosa was mixed with the ginger and rice-water, used as remedy for dropsy. A local fermentation with the leaves are used in relieving the pain of piles. T. asiatica fruit juice was used to arrest eye infection and leaves are served as medicine for gastric troubles (Kamsuk et al., 2007) . The solvent extracts of leaves (or) powders of Tarenna species found to be better antimicrobial (Jayasinghe et al., 2002) , antioxidant (Yang et al., 2007) and anti-inflammatory (Amutha et al., 2012) properties.
With the brief introduction, we performed the phytochemical profile and test the mosquitocidial potency of P. tomentosa and T. asiatica plant crude extracts against dengue vector and viral cell lines under laboratory condition.
The fresh and healthy plant leaves of P. tomentosa and T. asiatica were collected from Yercaud hills, Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India and plants name was authenticated by Botanical Survey of India, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India (BSI/SRC/5/23/2016/Tech./1069 (P. tomentosa) and BSI/SRC/5/23/2016/Tech./584 (T. asiatica). The plant leaves were washed with running tap-water for removal of the soils, dust particles and dried under room temperature for three weeks. Then the materials were powdered using electric blender. The known amount of P. tomentosa and T. asiatica leaf powders (25g) were extracted with five different solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, acetone and methanol) separately in 250ml of Soxhlet apparatus and the boiling point was differed at 50-80 C. The extracts were concentrated under reduced pressure (22-26 mm Hg) at 45 C. Then, the obtained crude extracts were collected in sterilized container and stored at room temperature for further analysis.
The mosquito (Ae. aegypti) larvae were obtained from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Mettupalayam, Tamil Nadu, India and kept in plastic trays containing tap water and maintained under laboratory condition. All the experiments were done an ideal environmental condition (i.e. 27 AE 2 C and 75-85% relative humidity under 14:10 light and dark photoperiods). Dog biscuits along with yeast powder is used as feed supplements to the larvae (in the ratio of 3:1) and maintained in the laboratory.
Larvicidal and pupicidal activity of different concentrations (100-900 μg/ml) leaf extracts of both plants were carried out as per the modified protocol of World Health Organization (2005) . The extracts were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5% DMSO, and then it was diluted with 249 ml of filtered tapwater to obtain the desired concentration of the each extract. The control was prepared using 1ml of 0.5% DMSO in 249 ml of water. The 4 th instar larvae and pupae (25Nos) were introduced into each solution. For each concentration, three replicates were maintained and the larval and pupal mortality was recorded, after 24 and 48 h exposure. During this period, no food was administered to the larvae and pupae of test mosquito (Govindarajan et al., 2016) .
Adulticidal bioassay of plants leaf extracts were performed as per the protocol of WHO (2009). Using clean glass test tube and different concentrations of solvent extracts (ranging from 100-900 μg/ml) were placed in test tube and allowed to dry. Three replicates were maintained per concentration and twenty unfed female mosquitoes were released in each replicate. Tubes were tightly covered with mosquito net and coated with solvent alone served as control and the mortality was observed, after 24 h.
Monolayer culture of C6/C36 mosquito cell line was brought from the local veterinary college, Tripathi, Andrapradesh and the cell line was maintained in the Prof. D.V.R. Sai Gopal Laboratory, Department of Viorology, Sri Vengateswara University, Tripathi. The cell culture plates were covered with spirit soaked cotton for removal of the adhering dust particles. The growth medium was discarded and then add 4-5 ml of MEM (without FCS) and gently rinsed. The dead cells and excess FCS were washed out and discarded the medium. TPVG was added over the cells and the plates were incubated at 37 C for 5 min for disaggregation of cells. The cells became individual and it's present as suspension. Add, 5ml of 10% MEM with FCS using serological pipette. Then, the passaging cells were split into 1:2 and 1:3 ratio for cytotoxicity assessment (Mossman, 1983 ).
The MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay of sample was done as per the modified protocol of Mossman (1983) . The each well was washed with MEM (w/o) FCS for 2-3 times, then add 200μl of MTT concentration (5 mg/ml) and incubated for 6-7 h in 5% CO 2 incubator, for studying the cytotoxicity assay. After incubation, 1ml of DMSO was added in each well and mixed by pipette and then left aside for 45sec. If any viable cells are seen after adding solubilizing reagent (DMSO) it shows the purple color formation. The suspension was transferred into the cuvette from spectrophotometer and taken Optical Density values at 595nm including the blank (DMSO). Cell viability (%) ¼ Mean OD/Control OD x 100.
The acetone extracts of two plants (10mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of serum free MEM yielded a concentration of 1mg/1mL. The freshly prepared stock was filtered through 0.45 filter, before to perform the experiment. The working concentration of plant crude extracts was maintained in the range of 1 mg/ml to 125 mg/ml.
The mosquito cells (C6/C36) were seeded at a concentration of 5000 cells/well in 96 well culture plates along with different concentrations of acetone extract of both plants and dengue virus (2.6 Â 10 5 TCID 50 ). Cells without plant extract and dengue virus cell used as controls. All the assays were tested in triplicates and the plates were incubated at 37 C at 5% CO 2 atmosphere and observed upto 72 h. A specific cytopathic change induced by dengue virus was noticed at different time intervals of 24, 48 and 72 h of post inoculation periods. After 72 h of post inoculation, the cells were stained with trypan blue and the viable cells were counted (Chiow et al., 2016) and marked.
The preliminary phytochemical analysis of both plants extracts were carried out by the modified protocol of Harbone (1973).
Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis of both plants crude extract was performed in the Agilent 6890 GC equipped with 5,973 N mass selective detectors and an HP-5 capillary column. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min À1 (constant flow). The sample (0.2 μl) was injected with a split of 20:1 and the temperatures were maintained at 230 C and 150 C, respectively (Govindarajan et al., 2011) .
The FT-IR spectrum of samples was measured using Arid Zone FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. About 5mg of plants sample was mixed with 100 mg of dry potassium bromide (KBr) and the mixture was compressed to yield the small pellet. The pellet was analysed under FTIR spectrophotometer in the range of 4,000 -500cm-1 at room temperature. An absorbance spectrum was acquired with 4cm À1 resolution and signal-averaged over 32 scans. Interferograms were Fourier transformed using cosine apodization for an optimum linear response. Spectra were baseline corrected, scaled for mass differences and normalized to the methylene peak at 2927 cm-1 (Cecilia et al., 2014) .
The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS software version 16.0 (Statistical Package of Social Sciences). The average mortality data of all stages of mosquito were subjected to probit analysis for calculate LC 50 , LC 90 , 95 % fiducial limits of upper and lower confidence limits, chisquare and CC 50 values. Results with p < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant (Finney, 1971) .
The crude extracts of both plants exhibits better larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti (Table 1) . The acetone and methanol extracts of P. tomentosa shown good mortality rate in Ae. aegypti with the LC 50 and LC 90 values of 9.325 and 1.223 μg/ml followed by T. asiatica having LC 50 and LC 90 values of 1.288 and 1.992, 1.284 and 1. 994 μg/ml (after 24 h) respectively. Whereas, the ethyl acetate and hexane extracts of P. tomentosa found to be moderate effect and T. asiatica noticed significant effect against Ae. aegypti. The least activity was noted in chloroform extract of both plants, after 24 h exposure period.
After 48 h treatment of both plants crude extract against the Ae. aegypti mosquito showed better mortality rate with least LC 50 and LC 90 values in tested extracts. i.e. acetone (9.122 and 7.493 μg/ml), ethyl acetate (6.914 and 9.060 μg/ml), hexane (8.625 and 1.170 μg/ml) and chloroform (5.968 and 7.493 μg/ml) respectively.
The pupicidal assay of plants extracts showed an excellent effect against test mosquito, after 24&48 h. Among them, acetone extract reflects highest pupicidal effect with the least LC 50 and LC 90 values i.e.
3.273 and 1.306 μg/ml, after 48 h exposure. Whereas, other tested crude extracts found to be more or less similar mortality rate, after 48 h of treatment.
The adulticidal activity results of both plants were observed at 0-60 min time intervals. The crude extracts of plants shown notable adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti. Among them, acetone and hexane extracts expressed good mortality and the best LC 50 and LC 90 values of P. tomentosa (32.105and 41.001 μg/ml, 11.810 and 44.215) and T. asiatica (09.012 and 11.852 μg/ml, 12.142 and 28.019 μg/ml) was noticed after 60 min.
The antiviral property of plant extracts shown no significant cytopathic changes in cells treated with acetone extracts of T. asiatica and the best CC 50 value was recorded in the concentration of 500 μg/ml, but P. tomentosa acetone extracts failed to restrict the virus cell lines at concentration of 125 μg/ml (Table 2 and Fig. 1 ) it means that P. tomentosa expressed good antiviral potential.
The preliminary phytochemical analysis of both plants revealed the presence of saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids in all the tested extracts. Amino acids and tannins were occurred in the acetone and methanol extracts. Proteins were present only in the chloroform extract and carbohydrates were found in chloroform and acetone extracts of both plants. Whereas, phenols are present only in the ethyl acetate extract of P. tomentosa (Table 3) .
The GC-MS chromatogram results reflected forty nine compounds present in the acetone extract of P. tomentosa and seven major compounds (Table 4 & Figs. 2 and 3) were identified as follows: Hexanedioic acid, Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) Ester, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 229 2, 6, 10, 15, 19 ,23-Hexamethyl-(ALL-E)-, 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-Hexadecen-1 OC, N-Hexadecanoic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Vitamin E and 1-Naphthalenepropanol, Alpha-Ethydecahydro-5-(Hydroxymethyl)-. But incase of T. asiatica have three major compounds like Tetracontane, 2-methyltetracosane and Eicosane ( Cytotoxicity concentration, denotes significant difference at P < 0.05, compared to the negative control using ANOVA followed by post hoc Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT), performed by SPSS software. (Table 6 & Figs. 6 and 7) . The highest sharp peak was noticed in aromatic compounds, so it may be a chance for presence of phenolic or flavonoids compounds in the plants.

The present study was aimed to investigate into the antiviral-cummosquitocidal property of two plants against dengue virus vis-a-vis its vector. Different solvents (acetone, methanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate and hexane) of leaf extracts of P. tomentosa and T. asiatica were found to be more effective against an important vector mosquito, Ae. aegypti. So far, there is no report pertaining to the mosquitocidal activity against P. tomentosa and T. asiatica plant. Nazar et al. (2009) and Dhanasekaran et al. (2013) investigated the larvicidal and repellent potential of Spermacoce hispida crude extracts against Ae. aegypti. The outcome of present study was comparable with the previous work done by Jayaraman et al., (2015) who reported that the larvicidal potential of various solvent extracts from seven aromatic plants against three mosquito vectors including Ae. aegypti and better larval mortality was recorded after 12 and 24 h of exposure. Previously, many medicinal plants reported as having potent larvicidal agents against dengue vector i.e. leaf extract of Solanum xanthocarpum Asparagus racemosus root extract (Govindarajan and Sivakumar, 2014) Orange peel extract of Citrus sinensis , leaf of Cassia fistula (Govindarajan, 2009) , Calotropis procera (Singh et al., 2005) Ocimum gratissimum and O. cannun (Pratheeba et al., 2015) respectively.
We clearly noticed that acetone extract of both plants have good antiviral activity against dengue virus through MTT assays. Similarly, Table 6 FT-IR analysis of acetone extracts from P. tomentosa and T. asiatica. Whereas, the outcome of present study noticed better results against dengue virus cell using P. tomentosa crude extracts at 125 μg/ml Klawikkan et al. (2011) reported that Thai medicinal plant extracts expressed better antiviral property against DENV-2 by MTT assays. Similarly, Ling et al. (2014) reported that O. sanctum extracts showed maximum inhibitory effects toward DENV-1. The preliminary phytochemical analyses of extracts from both plants observed the kind of results was observed by Borokini and Omotayo (2012) the presence of alkaloids in M. tomentosa. Praveena and Suriyavathana (2013) and Krishnakumar et al. (2015) analyzed the phytochemical nature of Toddalia asiatica for the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins. GC-MS from P. tomentosa plant leaf extracts shown major compounds may be responsible for potent larvicidal effect against Ae. aegypti. The bioactive compounds like alkaloids (Young et al., 1996) , Flavonoids (Lopes et al., 2004; Cardoso et al., 2005; Pinto et al., 2008) have been identified from may Rubiaceae plants. Similarly, Moharana et al. (2015) identified the essential oil from P. tomentosa leaves by GC-MS. GC-MS and FT-IR results of plant samples reflect the several bioactive compounds and its functional groups. N-Hexadecanoic acid, Palmitic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Squalene, Vitamin and Carboxylic acids, Esters, alkenes, alkynes, alcohol were present in P. tomentosa and T. asiatica crude extracts. Similarly, Fadipe (2014) reported the palmitic acid and ester were identified by GC-MS and FT-IR. The results of present investigation was comparable with the report of Owolabi et al. (2018) who found, the functional groups of bioactive compounds from Feretia apodanthera plant crude extracts. Similarly, Vanitha et al. (2018) studied the GCMS & FT-IR analysis of Benkara malabarica leaf extracts show the compounds along with functional groups (like N-Hexadecanoic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Vitamin E and Squalene and Aromatic rings and alkynes). The bioactive compounds and its functional groups were reported from Benkara brieyi (Odo et al., 2017) , Neolamarckia cadamba (Zayed et al., 2014) and Mentha spicata (Jain et al., 2016) by various researchers using GCMS and FTIR analysis.
In conclusion, we report the leaf extracts of P. tomentosa and T. asiatica had significant mosquitocidal property against Ae. aegypti vector mosquito. The remarkable antiviral activity of dengue virus was found in P. tomentosa than T. asiatica. The preliminary phytochemicals analysis results showed the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids and saponins in all extracts of P. tomentosa. GC-MS result reflects the presence of organic compounds, squalene or triterpene nature of compounds and FT-IR result indicate the functional groups of aromatic compounds, carboxylic acids, alkanes and alkyls. This is the first hand scientific informations on P. tomentosa and T. asiatica plant leaf extracts play a dual role for prevention of the dengue virus and its vector. Further study, in related to isolation of pure/active mosquitocidal and antiviral compounds from plants are under progress.

13,57d3826bb67ec3a479bc58f5e9210de44845b802,"A total of 1,320 tracheal samples from 66 broiler flocks sent to slaughterhouses and 42 tracheal samples from 42 flocks of local chickens in the field were collected for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) gene detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using nucleocapsid-specific primers and spike-specific primers. Prevalence in broiler flocks was 39.4% (26/66) and in local chicken flocks was 11.9% (5/42). Several IBVs similar to Japan were detected in Taiwan. One-direction neutralization revealed that the reference antisera did not offer protection against the IBVs similar to those from Japan.","Gammacoronavirus, and its genome encodes four structure proteins, spike glycoprotein (S), and membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2, 11] . New variant IBV strains in chickens continually emerge worldwide owing to the high mutation rate of its genome [4] . Various vaccines have been developed but the disease still occurs, because different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect and vaccine failures are often associated with the emergence of antigenic variants that differ from the vaccine viruses [9, 14] .
IBVs in Taiwan can be divided into two groups, Taiwan Group I (TW-I) and Taiwan Group II (TW-II) [16] . In order to control this disease, our laboratory has developed two live IB vaccines from the TW-I and TW-II IBV strains [9] . They can effectively protect chickens against homologous challenges [9] . They have been approved by the Taiwan government and will be used in the field in the poultry industry in Taiwan. The objective of this study was to investigate the IBV status in the field in order to prevent this disease in Taiwan.
In order to investigate the IBV prevalence and types in the field, a total of 66 broiler flocks from slaughterhouses were sampled in different seasons in 2013: 17 flocks in spring, 13 in summer, 15 in fall and 21 in winter. The broilers were at the market ages of 5 to 6 weeks old and sampled throughout Taiwan. The samples from slaughterhouses were named S before sampling numbers. Twenty tracheas were taken from each flock, and five tracheas were pooled into one tube for IBV gene detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The pooled tracheas were homogenized with tryptose phosphate broth (TPB), and the nucleic acids were extracted using a commercial viral nucleic acid extraction kit (Geneaid Biotech. Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan). In addition, 42 tracheal samples from 42 local chicken (LC) flocks [3] (one trachea per flock) were collected in the field in Southern Taiwan and named TC1 to TC42.
The presence of IBV in the trachea was evaluated by RT-PCR using the N-specific primers NP1/NP2 [8] . The primer sequences for this gene are as follows: NP1: 5′-GGTA G (C/T) GG (C/T) GTTCCTGATA A-3′ (26029-26048, H120 numbering, GenBank accession number: FJ888351) and NP2: 5′-TCATCTTGTC (A/G) TCAC CAAAA-3′ (26647-26628). The RT-PCR was performed according to a previously described method [8] . The RT-PCR products produced with this primer set were sequenced and compared. The RT-PCR products were sequenced at least twice from at least two RT-PCR products to make sure that the sequences were identical.
The samples that were IBV positive with the N-specific primer were subjected to RT-PCR and sequencing using the S-specific primer, oligo5/rC3-r for genotyping [17] . The sequences of these primers are as follows: oligo5: 5′-AAACT GAACA AAAGA CAGAC TTAG-3′ (20251-20274, H120 numbering, GenBank accession number: FJ888351) and rC3-r: 5′-(A/G) CAAT GTGTA ACAAA (T/C) ACT-3′ (20655-20637). The same RT-PCR procedure was performed, except the annealing temperature for this primer set was 52°C. For LC field cases, one trachea from each flock was subjected to RT-PCR using the same method described for broilers. The prevalence differences among different seasons or chicken types were analyzed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests when any cell having expected value less than 5 [12] . The level of a significant difference was set at α 0.05.
All the tracheas from the slaughterhouses and from LC flocks were free of obviously gross lesions. Sixty-six flocks were sampled in the study period. Twenty tracheal samples per flock were taken for a total of 1,320 tracheal samples. The lower prevalence in LC flocks might be due to sampling differences, because 20 tracheas were sampled from each broiler flock but only one trachea was sampled from each LC flock.
The present investigation might have under-estimated the actual prevalence, because we only sampled tracheas for virus detection. IBV can be detected in the trachea during the first 3 to 5 days post-infection. After this period, the virus titer falls quickly in the second week [6] . We may have missed the acute infection stage when sampling slaughterhouses due to the elapsed time between the beginning of the infection and sampling. Indeed, the present prevalence is lower than that reported in previous studies in the United Kingdom and Jordan [10, 13] . The prevalence in those studies reached about 60%, because the sampled chickens exhibited respiratory signs of infection or IB was suspected during sampling. In the present investigation, the broilers may have been healthy, because they reached market age for the slaughterhouses. The phylogenetic tree constructed using the N gene sequences is shown in Fig. 1 . The Taiwanese strain could be distinguished from the other IBVs using this N gene. However, this segment could not be used to separate the Taiwan strain into its different groups, TW-I and TW-II. In order to distinguish TW-I from TW-II, we used primers located at the 5′ terminus of the S gene, and the resulting phylogenetic tree could distinguish between TW-I and TW-II (Fig. 2) . There were more TW-II samples than TW-I samples in this investigation. The S1 and S7 isolates might be from the 4/91 vac-cine strain, because they were very similar (Figs. 1 and 2) . The S36, S75, S76 and S77 isolates were from another vaccine, H120, commonly used in Taiwan.
The striking finding in this investigation was the appearance of IBVs similar to those reported in Japan, including the S14, S41, S78 and S79 isolates and a field case, TC3. Sixteen percent (5/31) of IBVs detected were similar to those isolates in Japan. The S14, S41, S78 and S79 isolates were sampled from Changhua (Central Taiwan), Chiayi (South-central Taiwan), Hsinchu (North-central Taiwan) and Taoyuan (Northern Taiwan), respectively. The TC3 field case was from Southern Taiwan. All the IBV strains that were similar to Japanese ones were from different locations, indicating that these IBVs might be widespread in Taiwan. The sequence similarity among them reached 95.38% to 100%.
Eight tracheal samples positive for the IBV gene were selected for virus isolation, including S14, S41, S78, TC3, TC4, TC5, TC17 and TC38, using specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos (Animal Health Research Institute, Chiding, Taiwan). Tracheal samples were frozen at −20°C. After thawing, the organs were homogenized in sterile TPB in a 1:10 ratio. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was treated with a 1% mixture of ampicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit-Haemek, Israel) for 1 hr at room temperature and then inoculated into the allantoic cavity of five 9-to-11-day-old SPF embryonated eggs. The eggs were incubated for 5 days and candled each day. After 5 days of incubation, the eggs were chilled at 4°C, and the allantoic fluid was collected. Each sample was given two blind passages before being considered negative. The presence of IBV in the allantoic fluid was detected using RT-PCR with NP1/NP2 primers [8] . Only two IBVs, S78 and TC3, were isolated. The IBVs were confirmed as IBV using sequencing. The IBV isolates were then used for one-direction neutralization tests with reference anti-IBV antisera.
The one-direction neutralization tests were performed using a constant virus-constant antiserum procedure as described previously [15] . The antisera used for this test included anti-TW-I, anti-TW-II and anti-Mass (Charles River Lab, North Franklin, CT, U.S.A.) [4] . Briefly, 100 µl of virus (containing 100 50% viral embryo infectious doses) was incubated with 100 µl of antiserum (containing 20 units) at room temperature for 1 hr. The infectivity of the virusantiserum mixture was assayed in 10 9-to-11-day-old SPF chicken embryos. After 1 week, embryos were evaluated for IBV infection by observing for death, dwarfing and urate deposition as described for virus titration. In the control groups, antisera were replaced with PBS. A virus was considered to match the serotype of the antiserum, if the antiserum protected five or more of the embryos. The results showed that the two new IBV isolates similar to Japan, S78 and TC3, were not neutralized completely with the reference antisera. The protection rates for S78 by anti-TW-I, anti-TW-II and anti-Mass were 0/10 (numbers protected/ numbers tested), 0/10 and 0/10, respectively. Those for TC3 were 1/10, 4/10 and 0/10, respectively. The results indicated that both viruses could not be neutralized by reference antisera, since their protection rates were less than 50%. Despite extensive vaccination, IB has occurred occasionally, especially in cold seasons. Most IBVs present in Taiwan are TW-I or TW-II. Surprisingly, in the present study, TW-II was more predominant than TW-I, contrary to previous reports [5, [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, a challenging aspect of this investigation was the emergence of new types, such as the IBVs similar to strains isolated in Japan, which were found to be widespread in Taiwan since they were identified in different locations and different chicken breeds. A previous study revealed that five genotypes existed in Japan in 2010, JP-I, JP-II, JP-III, 4/91 and Mass [1] . In the present study, the IBVs that were similar to Japanese strains showed the highest similarity to JP-I. However, the origin of these isolates is unknown and needs further investigation. The current vaccine strains might not protect against these new isolates, since the one-direction neutralization tests showed less than 50% protection in chicken embryos.",Detection of infectious bronchitis virus strains similar to Japan in Taiwan,"TSAI, Cheng-Ta; TSAI, Hsin-Fu; WANG, Ching-Ho",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4905846/,90,1540,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,1ed5058204d1330e780f20fca2694bc0fd20d329,"Introduction. Even brief episodes of fecal contamination of drinking water can lead directly to illness in the consumers. In water-borne outbreaks, the connection between poor microbial water quality and disease can be quickly identified. The impact of non-compliant drinking water samples due to E. coli taken for regular monitoring on the incidence of notified acute gastrointestinal infections has not yet been studied.
Methods. The objective of this study was to analyse the geographical distribution of notified acute gastrointestinal infections (AGI) in Slovenia in 2010, with hotspot identification. The second aim of the study was to correlate the fecal contamination of water supply system on the settlement level with the distribution of notified AGI cases. Spatial analysis using geo-information technology and other methods were used.
Hot spots with the highest proportion of notified AGI cases were mainly identified in areas with small supply zones. The risk for getting AGI was drinking water contaminated with E. coli from supply zones with 50-1000 users: RR was 1.25 and significantly greater than one (p-value less than 0.001).
Conclusion. This study showed the correlation between the frequency of notified AGI cases and noncompliant results in drinking water monitoring.

ABSTRACT Keywords: acute gastrointestinal infections, surveillance, drinking water monitoring, quality of drinking water, fecal pollution of drinking water, GIS IZVLEČEK Ključne besede: akutne črevesne okužbe, spremljanje, monitoring pitne vode, kvaliteta pitne vode, fekalna kontaminacija pitne vode, GIS","Acute diarrhea is characterised by changed stool consistency (soft, liquid), increased frequency -more than three times a day -and increased volume (1) . It is one of the most common disorders for which the patients seek medical help (1) . Diarrhea in children remains a common reason for hospitalisation (1) . Over 90% of all cases of acute infectious diarrhea are caused by enteropathogenic bacteria, viruses and parasites (1) . The latter are transmitted by fecal oral route, which means that pathogens from the patient or carrier are introduced into the oral cavity of another potential host. The process of transmission may be simple, or it may involve multiple steps, namely:
• The ingestion of (untreated) water that has come in contact with feces;
• the ingestion of food that has been prepared in the presence of fecal matter;
• disease vectors, such as house flies, rats, mice, spreading contamination from inadequate fecal disposal;
• a poor or absent cleaning after handling feces, etc.
The burden of diseases caused by food-borne and waterborne pathogens remains largely unknown globally, but it is probably high. For example, diarrhea associated with infections resulting from oral-fecal contamination is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, primarily in Africa and South Asia (2) . A number of diarrhea studies have been carried out in different countries. For instance, in Germany, a nationwide representative cross-sectional telephone survey of 21262 adults over a 12-month period during 2008 and 2009, was conducted. Participants were asked if they had had either AGI-related diarrhea or vomiting in a 4-week recall period. The burden of diarrhea was estimated to be quite high: 0.95 episodes/person per year (95% confidence interval 0·90-0·99) (3) . In Slovenia, a population-based self-reported acute gastrointestinal infection (AGI) cross sectional study was carried out in June 2011. The comparison of the incidence of AGI-based on notification in June 2011, and incidence-based on the results of the study showed that the latter incidence was 56 times higher than the first one. The burden of AGI among population of Slovenia is quite high. The cross sectional study should be repeated and laboratory analysis of acute AGI cases added to get a better insight of epidemiological situation (4).
One of several risk factors for diarrhea is unsafe drinking water. Microbiologically contaminated drinking water has the potential to cause extensive outbreaks of illness due to the size of the populations served by the distribution system (5, 6) .
People can catch waterborne diseases from contamination of both natural and man-made environments with human and animal feces (7) . Diarrheal disease due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death, is declining worldwide (8) . Halving a number of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water had an enormous impact on decreasing the incidence of diarrheal diseases (9) . A comprehensive literature review identifies 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans, including 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa and 287 helminths. Out of these, 868 (61%) are zoonotic, that is, they can be transmitted between humans and animals (10) Hygienic measures, socio-economic changes and climatic changes have a significant impact on the emergence and spread of water-associated microorganisms. The occurrence of some has gradually been reduced, e.g. typhoid fever, while the incidence of others has risen: Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7, noroviruses, Cryptosporidium and Giardia (12) . Some new pathogens include environmental bacteria and viruses that are highly capable of surviving and proliferating in water distribution systems. Moreover, they are highly resistant to chemical disinfecting procedures (12) . Waterborne viruses are gaining in importance as etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis. In children, they cause mixed viral infections with a severe clinical picture (12) .
In some countries, such as Finland, the finding that noroviruses frequently cause waterborne outbreaks has led to the authorities' increased awareness of viral risks. As a consequence, laboratory techniques have been improved and the capacity for analysing environmental samples, especially water, has increased (13).
Drinking-water supply surveillance contributes to protecting public health by promoting the improvement of the quality, quantity, accessibility, coverage, affordability and continuity of water supplies, and it is complementary to the quality control function of the drinking-water supplier (14) . Since 2004, the monitoring in Slovenia completely complies with Council Directive 98/83/EC (15) . The drinking water monitoring in Slovenia is determined by the Rules on drinking water (Official Gazette of the Republic Slovenia. Nr. 19/2004, 35/2004, 26/2006, 92/2006 and 25/2009 ).
It has been repeatedly discovered that the quality of drinking water in some small supply zones in Slovenia (providing drinking water to 50-1000 inhabitants) does not comply with the standards -the indicators of fecal contamination were identified in the water samples (16) . Small supply zones are supplied by surface water, or they are in contact with the surface. The small supply zones are facing a number of problems, which have an impact on the quality of drinking water, e.g.:
• unprotected catchment areas of water sources, • no water treatment or disinfection -especially at water sources that are, or were connected with, surface water, and for all water sources in the area of Karst aquifers,
• inadequate sampling points and/or sampling time (such as only temporary use of sampling),
• the consequences of unexpected events, such as flooding and extended rainfall, for the water sources with a present or past contact with the surface water,
• the lack of financial resources in small supply zones -the costs of repair are often too high to be covered by providers.
There are several different ways to acquire AGI -through contaminated food, directly from a patient, or indirectly through soiled fomites. Last but not least, AGI is waterborne.
Acute gastrointestinal infections (AGI) are still the cause of a considerable burden of disease in Slovenia. There were from 15 000 to 22 000 (with the incidence rate from 750 to 1100 per 100 000 inhabitants) of AGI cases notified per year in the last decade (17) . However, the incidence is calculated according to notified cases. As only a fraction of overall cases appear as notifications, the real burden of AGI is expected to be much higher. Among microbiologically confirmed notified AGI cases, the most frequent ones were noroviral (the incidence rate in 2010 was 21/100 000) and rotaviral infections (the incidence rate 78/100 000). Viral gastrointestinal infections are followed by AGI, caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli. The epidemiological situation in EU countries is similar: Campylobacter infections are the most frequently reported bacterial gastrointestinal infections. In 2010, the total EU incidence was 57/100 000 inhabitants. Reported rates are increasing; most cases are sporadic, with high seasonal peaks in the summer, but multinational outbreaks are infrequent. Salmonella infection remains the second most commonly identified gastrointestinal disease across EU, with the total incidence of 21/100 000 inhabitants in 2010. The reported incidence of Salmonella infection has been declining steadily since 2004, partly due to EU control programmes in poultry farms. However, Salmonella continues to be the source of many outbreaks, both within and between countries (18) . The data for incidences of viral gastroenterocolitis are not available.
The objective of this study was to analyse the patterns of the geographical distribution of notified AGI in Slovenia in 2010, and to identify potential hotspots.
The surveillance of AGI in Slovenia is based on the Law on Communicable Diseases (Official Gazette Republic of Slovenia, No 33/06) and the Act on Registration (Official Gazette Republic of Slovenia, No 16/99). According to the Law, a case of AGI has to be notified by the treating physician using a standard notification form. The data collected on the notification form include: a name, surname, date of birth, permanent address, notification date, and disease code according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). The data is collected at the regional level, then sent to the National Institute of Public Health and entered into SURVIVAL (the national electronic database of communicable diseases in Slovenia).
Only AGI cases reported in 2010 were included in the study. Patients with the following ICD-10 codes were extracted from the database: • A09 Gastro-enterocolitisacuta of presumed infectious origin.
The notified cases coded as bacterial food-borne intoxications (ICD-10 code A05) were not included in the analysis. Cryptosporidiosis and amoebiasis were not included, as there were only seven and eight notified cases in 2010, respectively. There were two cases of typhoid fever and one case of cholera -all three patients acquired the infection abroad. In total, 18 070 patients were included in the analysis.
For geographical analysis, the data at the settlement level was used.
The surveillance of drinking water in Slovenia is based on the Rules on drinking water (Official Gazette Republic of Slovenia, No 19/04, 35/04, 26/06, 92/06, 25/09). According to the Rules, the monitoring of drinking water quality is carried out by the supplier (an internal control) and by the Ministry of Health (19) . The monitoring of drinking water quality is carried out in order to make sure that the water available to consumers meets the requirements of the Rules, and, in particular, the limit values of the parameters set in the Rules.
A supply zone is a geographically defined area within which the water intended for human consumption comes from one or more sources, and within which the water quality may be considered as being approximately uniform (15) . The samples collected for monitoring should be taken so that they are representative of the quality of the water consumed throughout the year (15 The results of the regular drinking water monitoring intended for human consumption was collected from the Database of Drinking Water Systems and of the compliance of drinking water for 2010.
For analytical purposes, the drinking water supply zones were grouped into three categories, according to the number of users, namely: small (50-1000 users), medium (1001 to 10 000 users) and large (> 10 000 users). There were 1-2 and 4 samples taken in small and medium supply zones, respectively, in the year 2010.The microbiological controls applied to drinking water rely on the analysis of fecal pollution indicators. However, the use of these indicators may be substituted by the direct detection of pathogenic microorganisms, e.g., in the case of pathogenic viruses (20).
The spatial distribution of AGI was compared to the water quality in the water supplying zones. We set the hypothesis that at least a part of AGI could be correlated to microbiologically contaminated drinking water.
The permanent addresses of 18 070 notified AGI cases were available from the national electronic database of communicable diseases. In some cases, old municipal names or settlement names were used instead of the official names maintained in the Registry of spatial units (The Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia), available at: http://e-prostor.gov.si/index. php?id=416 . Wrong names were entered in the database, or local names were used for few notified cases which prevented appropriate geolocation. In the first step, 402 (2.8 %) notified AGI cases that could not be appropriately spatially located were excluded from the study, as shown in the flowchart (Figure 1 ). In the next step, notified AGI cases were aggregated to the settlement level.
17 672 notified AGI cases resided in 3204 settlements. Approximately one third of the AGI patients resided in settlements that have an individual drinking water supply system. These systems are not under regular monitoring control of drinking water quality and, therefore, these patients were excluded as well. Finally (as shown in Figure 1 ), it was possible to link 11 638 notified AGI cases with the monitoring of the drinking water.
Supply zones could not be geolocated as polygons; instead, the geographical coordinates of the sampling points were used in the presented analysis. Some records in the drinking-water supply surveillance (monitoring) sample point dataset had wrong coordinates of the surveillance location or sampling point. Most of these discrepancies could be solved manually. Unresolved cases were excluded from the analysis. Geolocating the supply zones could not be implemented fully. For the present analysis, the geographical coordinates of the sampling points were used. In the last step of data preparation, both AGI cases and supply zones were attributed to the settlements. The data on the case level was analysed, and relative risks by the size of the drinking water supply zones were calculated for users who were supplied with E.coli contaminated water. The assumption was made that persons diagnosed with AGI were drinking water from the supply zone attributed to the same settlement. For each supply zone, the data on the results of the monitoring of drinking water quality and the total number of users were available.
The geographical analysis and data preparation were processed using ArcGIS 10 and Oracle 11g relation database geo-information technology. The spatial datasets of municipal and settlements areas were recovered from the Registry of Spatial Units, which is maintained by The Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia. * Patients living in a settlement not linked to a supply zone are supplied with the drinking water from an individual water supply system serving less than 50 users, and, therefore, they were not included in the analysis. However, there is the possibility of a supply zone having users in more than one village, and there is not a sampling point in all villages. The available data does not provide adequate information to link a supply zone to such a village. The Register of public water supply systems could not be used to more precisely determine the residence of the remaining patients from the first note, and, thus, we were unable to link them to the supply zones. Such a procedure could not be automated, and it requires a lot of manual work due to the nonconnectivity of the databases.
** For 17 out of 1204 patients with AGI who were checked manually to identify the supply zone, the zone could not be recognized, and they were, therefore, excluded from the analysis. 
In the year 2010, the National Institute of Public Health received app. 20 000 AGI notifications including infections and intoxications. After excluding bacterial intoxications, 18 070 AGI cases were considered for the analysis. Most of the notified cases (about 70%) were not confirmed microbiologically -the diagnosis of AGI relied on clinical symptoms alone (Table 1) . Viruses, such as noroviruses and rotaviruses, were the second and third most common cause of AGI, followed by Campylobacter spp. with 999 cases in the year 2010.The reported incidence of Salmonella infections has been declining since 2004, associated, at least in part, with successful infection control programmes in poultry farming and industry (the data is not shown). 
There were 968 drinking water supply zones, supplying 50 or more users in Slovenia, providing 1 820 000 (89%) residents with public water in 2010 (Table 2) . These supply zones were regularly monitored. Therefore, microbiological (check monitoring) and chemical (audit monitoring) data on water quality was available. 68% of the population has been covered by 78 supply zones (8 % of the total), serving more than 5000 consumers. Almost 800 small water supply zones serve only a small proportion of the population (9%).
The rest of the Slovenian population (app. 230 000 inhabitants, 11%) is served by an individual supply of drinking water. These individual supply systems each serve less than 50 individuals and are not covered by the water quality monitoring programme. We determined more than 10% of non-compliant samples containing E. coli as contaminated supply zones, whereas other supply zones are considered uncontaminated. The proportion of non-compliant samples signifi cantly decreased as the size of the water supply zone increased: the percentages of non-compliant samples due to the presence of E. coli in small, medium and large supply zones were 18.9%, 3,7% and 0.5%, respectively.
Another fact is that the burden of coliform bacteria in small supply zones was above 1000/100 ml. The burden of coliform bacteria in larger supply zones was signifi cantly smaller, less than 10/100 ml (the data is not shown).
Map 1 illustrates the geographical distribution of 18 070 notifi ed AGI cases. The biggest circles on the map denote the highest percentage of inhabitants in a settlement that developed AGI severe enough to visit their doctor's offi ce in 2010.
Though the notifi ed AGI cases were distributed all over Slovenia, some areas had a much higher proportion of the population affected than others. Higher AGI incidences were observed in settlements that are located in the Southern (around Ilirska Bistrica) and South-Eastern part of the country (from Črnomelj to Brežice) (Map 1).
The alpine region of Slovenia (the North-Western part) from Kranj to Jesenice is also a part of the country where high AGI incidence settlements were located. These settlements are mainly small in size and drinking water is mainly provided from small supply zones.
The data from the regular monitoring of drinking water quality in 2010 was added to the geographical distribution of notifi ed AGI cases on the settlement level, as shown on Map 2. The quality of drinking water in the Koroška region was not compliant in quite a few sampling points, but the number of notifi ed AGI cases coming from this region was low. The relative risk for users of small, medium and large supply zones contaminated with E. coli is presented in 
There was no prior study in Slovenia in which the surveillance data of acute gastrointestinal infections has been linked to E. coli findings from the regular monitoring of drinking water quality. Even though a high incidence of diarrheal diseases could be a logical consequence of poor water quality and has been confirmed in many water-borne outbreak situations (22) , the benefit of a compulsory notification system for waterborne outbreaks is proved to be an effective tool for gathering information and increasing the awareness of possible problems related to the quality of drinking water (23) . But the impact of microbiologically contaminated water on AGI incidence confirmed by the link between the non-compliant results of water quality monitoring due to E. coli and AGI incidence, has not yet been studied.
The data derived from the surveillance of communicable diseases showed that acute gastrointestinal infections cause a considerable burden in Slovenia. In 2010, the incidence rate of notified cases with gastrointestinal communicable disease was app. 1000 per 100 000 inhabitants (21). The real burden is probably much higher as many patients with acute gastroenterocolitis do not seek medical help, as vomiting or diarrhoea are mostly self-limiting and of short duration. Even when the patient consults the doctor -e.g. suffering from a more severe disease, or simply in need of the certificate for a sick-leave -the obligation to notify is probably often overlooked by the physician. Children younger than four years of age account for more than half of all the notified cases. Babies and toddlers with vomiting and/or diarrhoea are prone to dehydrate quickly and their parents are thus more eager to visit the doctor's office.
The overall incidence rate of the notified acute gastrointestinal infections (AGI) increased by more than 60% between 1999 and 2010 in Slovenia (24) . The number of notified viral AGI stepped up for app. 400% and the numbers of 'gastroenterocolitis acuta with an unknown agent' (coded as A0.9, ICD-10) nearly doubled. The reason for that is, on one hand, the rise of viral enteritis cases (mostly norovirus and rotavirus) and, on the other hand, the drop of laboratory confirmed cases of AGI due to lack of financial resources. In that way, many viral enteritis cases, probably norovirus and rotavirus one, are notified The relative risk (confidence interval) Table 3 . The relative risk for AGI between the users using the water contaminated with E. coli and those using uncontaminated water for the three sizes of water supply zones.
as gastroenterocolitis acuta with an unknown agent. A substantial increase in viral gastrointestinal diseases is probably partly due to improved laboratory diagnostics. A downward trend has been observed for salmonellosis and shigellosis, but not for campylobacteriosis (24) .
Mapping the notified cases of AGI in 2010 (Map 1), showed that in the North-Western area (from Kranj to Jesenice) and around Nova Gorica, the South-Eastern and Southern part of the country (especially near Ilirska Bistrica and from Črnomelj in the South, to Brežice in the South-East), there were settlements with a high incidence of AGI. The main driving force behind the differences observed might be that some physicians are keen to notify and others are not. A less plausible explanation is that patients with AGI consult more frequently in one county than in another. Further, the differences in the geographical distribution of food-borne outbreaks in 2010, would clarify the uneven distribution of AGI cases. There were 57 outbreaks reported, caused by enteral pathogens (only one was waterborne) in 2010, which were relatively uniformly distributed throughout the country (the data is not shown) (16) , and which, therefore, cannot explain the difference.
The quality of drinking water might, at least partially, be an explanatory variable for the geographical differences in the incidence of AGI in 2010. Notified water-borne outbreaks (WBOs) are rare in Slovenia -there were 86 WBOs registered between 1981 and 2010 (21). Shigella flexneri and sonnei were the predominant pathogens in the first decade, causing half of the WBOs. The number of notified WBOs has declined in recent years and the aetiology has changed (25) . There were only one to two WBOs per year in the last ten years, and most of them were caused by viruses (most often noroviruses) (21). Noroviruses were identified as an important cause of outbreaks in different settings, including WBOs also in Sweden (26) . Craun and co-workers (2010) comprehensively described outbreaks associated with drinking water in the US from 1971 to 2006. A drop in the number of notified outbreaks related to drinking water has been observed as well, especially in public systems. The decline was attributed to improved infrastructure and the impact of national regulations (27) . Individual water systems and systems supplied by ground water were more at risk of contamination (27) . A high prevalence of enteric viruses has been found in untreated individual drinking water sources in Slovenia as well (28) . Drinking water quality in Slovenia is generally good, especially in large water supply zones, but it is not of the same quality in all parts of the country: microbiological problems are found in small water supply zones in rural areas, and contamination with nitrates and pesticides in some areas with extensive agriculture (the North-Eastern part of the country). Without doubt, it has not been significantly improved in the 2004-2010 period (16) .
According to the results of our study, water contamination with E. coli primarily affected users of small supply zones, serving between 50 and 1000 users in rural areas, as they were 1.25 times more likely to get sick, compared with those who use safe water. The supply zones with more than 10 000 users are less often contaminated, and, if they are, E. coli was found in less than 10% of the water samples taken. The risk for AGI in the larger supply zones was lower for those users who were supplied with contaminated water -an unexpected finding which is difficult to interpret. It may be that users in large supply zones (mainly in bigger cities) are inclined to drink bottled water and, therefore, the temporary contamination does not have an augmenting effect on AGI. Another possible explanation might be that larger water supply systems are better controlled, that any change in water quality is detected immediately, and that consumers are instructed not to use water for drinking/cooking without boiling.
Nevertheless, the result supports the hypothesis that microbiologically contaminated water proved by E. coli non-compliant results in drinking water has an impact on public health, especially in small supply zones. Microbiological quality is strongly associated with the size of the supply zone -in large and medium-sized supply zones the drinking water is mostly of good quality.
We believe that the small supply zone systems should be properly regulated. Small supply zones often have deficiencies in their management plans, reflecting in the poor quality of the water. Only 1-2 samples per year taken in the smallest supply zone systems do not fully show the quality of the drinking water, and they could even be misleading.
The limitation of the study was that a part of the notified AGI cases that were correlated with the results of the drinking water monitoring were probably foodborne, and that a part of notified cases acquired AGI by a direct contact with a patient at a workplace, school, kindergarten, or indirectly through contaminated fomites.
The study was performed under the assumption that acute gastrointestinal infections, transmitted directly or indirectly, are uniformly distributed across the country, as there was no major food-borne outbreak affecting one region only. Under ideal conditions, only water-borne AGI cases should be included in the study and compared to microbiology, especially the faecal contamination of drinking water samples taken at approximately the same time as the illness occurred. To conduct a study under these ideal conditions is practically an unreachable goal.
In most of the cases (outside of outbreak situations), patients are not able to identify the source of the infection, and they are not aware of the fact that the pathogen causing the diarrhoea and/or vomiting was water-borne. The sample points for the monitoring of drinking water do not include the individual supply zones that supply less than 50 users. Therefore, AGI cases residing in settlements with small supply zones (less than 50 users) were not included in the analysis. It would be very interesting to do a study comparing the incidence of AGI in users of the above mentioned supply zones and the microbiological results of drinking water. The recent study showed that enteric viruses were more frequently found in individual water systems compared to public water systems in Slovenia (28) .
The second limitation of the study is that the real burden of AGI, like in most countries, is expected to be much higher than the one based on notifications. The estimated risk ratio for AGI in microbiologically contaminated areas is probably lower than the one with the data from the real burden would have been, but just when the unnotified cases are unevenly distributed between those water sources that are microbiologically contaminated and those that are not.
The last limitation of the study remains the universal, global use of bacterial indicators of fecal contamination of water. Good environmental survival of important waterborne viruses and protozoa raised serious questions about the suitability of the reliance on relatively shortlived coliforms as indicators of the microbiological quality of water. That is, while the presence of coliforms could still be taken as a sign of fecal contamination, the absence of coliforms could no longer be taken as a guarantee that water was uncontaminated. Thus, existing bacterial indicators and indicator approaches do not, in all circumstances, identify all potential waterborne pathogens; their presence in water is also ""underreported"". Indeed, no single indicator organism, or a small set of indicators, can successfully identify or predict the presence, let alone the source, of all classes of potential pathogens -especially emerging microorganisms (20) .
But indicator approaches will still be required for the foreseeable future, since it is not practical or feasible to monitor the complete spectrum of microorganisms that may occur in water, and as many known pathogens are difficult to detect directly and reliably in water samples. The shortcoming of bacterial indicators to predict parasites and viruses, which can be more resistant to disinfection, and the fact that information derived from the microbiological analysis is not immediate (neither is obtained in a continuous manner), have motivated the development of more preventive approaches, like the Water Safety Plans proposed by the WHO (20) .
Despite the limitations of the study, we believe that the ecological study showed the impact of non-compliant drinking water due to E. coli on the incidence of acute gastrointestinal infections, especially in highly contaminated small supply zones.
This ecological study showed the correlation between the frequency of notified AGI and non-compliant fecal results of drinking water quality monitoring, especially in small water supply zones. From the public health aspect, the small water systems must comply with all the professional structural and operational demands, otherwise it is better to arrange the supply in a different way -for example, through larger systems.

One presented with upper airway signs, and was identified to have a focal laryngeal lesion. The other had central neurological signs at the terminal stages, with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies identified within the cerebral hemispheres on histopathology. Relevance and novel information Currently, cowpox would be an unlikely consideration in patients with neurological signs or upper respiratory noise. These cases both document novel presentations of cowpox infection, which clinicians should be aware of and consider as differential diagnoses in patients with these atypical presentations.","A number of different poxviruses can infect both people and domestic animals; with cowpox being the best described and most commonly encountered poxvirus infection of cats. Cowpox virus (CPxV) is a member of Orthopoxviridae family and is endemic in Northern Europe and western areas of the Soviet Union. 1 The usual route of infection is via skin inoculation from infected rodent bites, typically voles, or rarely via oronasal infection. 2 Reflective of this transmission route, skin lesions are commonly found on the head, neck and forelimbs. However, systemic illness such as pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy and/or pneumonia can occur during the viraemic phase and is usually associated with immune dysfunction and death. 3, 4 It is important that clinicians recognise the signs of potential CPxV infection and perform appropriate diagnostics early. A significant factor contributing to the prognosis of CPxV infection in cats is the speed at which appropriate therapy is instituted, so rapid recognition is crucial. Cytological analysis of the affected organs can be misleading, with the secondarily dysplastic cells having the potential to mimic neoplasma. Instead, electron microscopy, virus isolation and PCR of tissues (including skin scabs, bronchoalveolar or pleural fluid, or pulmonary aspirates) are the easiest ways to confirm the diagnosis. 5 Serum assays (including virus neutralisation, haemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation and ELISA) can be utilised to detect a humoral response to Novel characteristics identified in two cases of feline cowpox virus infection orthopoxvirus, although a rising titre is required to support active infection. 4 Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics to control secondary bacterial infection and recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-ω) to modulate the immune response. Antiviral drugs, such as famciclovir, commonly used for the treatment of feline herpesvirus (FeHV-1) disease in cats, 6 could also be considered; however, their efficacy against CPxV is unknown.
Our previous case series detailed cats that had pulmonary CPxV-infection, complicated by concomitant infection with FeHV-1, Bordetella bronchiseptica and/or Mycoplasma species. 4 The cases described herein have novel findings which have not previously been described in relation to this infection, including central nervous system (CNS) involvement and presentation as a laryngeal mass.
Case 1 A 6-year-old, neutered male domestic shorthair (DSH) cat was seen at the VRCC for investigation and management of dysphonia and intermittent inspiratory stridor of 17 days' duration. The cat was vaccinated against feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus and FeHV-1, lived in a rural area and was reported to be a keen hunter. Routine haematology and serum biochemistry were unremarkable. Serum was negative for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) p27 antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies and feline coronavirus antibodies. Under general anaesthesia, full oropharyngeal and laryngeal examination identified laryngeal oedema with normal function. The cat was discharged with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Clavaseptin [Vetoquinol] 15 mg/kg PO q12h).
A week later, the cat re-presented with inspiratory dyspnoea and pronounced inspiratory stridor. No other abnormalities were found on physical examination, except for sinus bradycardia (heart rate ranging between 84 and 120 bpm). An atropine response test was positive, indicating that the bradycardia was likely due to high vagal tone. Neither skin lesions nor pyrexia were present.
Full oropharyngeal and laryngeal examination was repeated and identified a 1 cm right-sided para-laryngeal mass and oedema affecting the right arytenoid process. Biopsy samples were obtained for histopathology, and identified a cluster of epithelial cells with intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies, as well as an inflammatory infiltrate ( Figure 1 ). Quantitative PCR performed on scrolls from the formalin-fixed biopsies confirmed the presence of CPxV DNA within the sections. Thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound excluded the presence of disseminated disease.
The cat was given supportive care, including oxygen and compound sodium lactate (Hartmann's solution, 2 ml/kg/h IV). Feline rFeIFN-ω (Virbagen Omega; Virbac [1 MU/kg SC q24h for 3 days]), prednisolone (Prednicare [Animal Care] 0.5 mg/kg PO q24h), marbofloxacin (Marbocyl [Vetoquinol] 2 mg/kg IV q24h) and famciclovir (Famvir [Novartis] 62.5 mg PO q12h) were also administered. Following clinical improvement the cat was discharged.
Fourteen days after first presentation, full oropharyngeal and laryngeal examination revealed the lesion had grossly resolved, as had the previously reported clinical signs. A year after diagnosis, the cat was clinically well with no further episodes of stridor or dysphonia.
A 4-year-10-month-old, neutered male DSH cat presented to its primary veterinary practice with a history of focal superficial ulceration with associated oedema and swelling of the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the caudal mammary region; the cat had a temperature of 39.0°C. It had a history of being an avid hunter and was overweight at the time, with a body condition score of 7/9. The cat was treated with cefovecin (Convenia [Zoetis] 8 mg/kg SC) and oral meloxicam (Metacam [Boehringer Ingelheim] 0.05 mg/kg PO q24h).
Three days later the cat was re-presented. There had been no response to the previous treatment with the lesion worsening in appearance, which now had a widened area of ulceration, pronounced thickening and marked oedema of the underlying subcutaneous tissue. Oral clindamycin (Antirobe [Zoetis] 5.5 mg/kg q12h) was commenced in addition to the current medications.
A further 2 days later, the area of ulceration affecting the ventral abdomen had progressed to a necrotic eschar (Figure 2) , with a concurrent increase in lethargy and discomfort. There were also multiple small raised nodules surrounding the central necrotic area, and crusting papules and nodules around the head and neck (Figure 3 ). Buprenorphine was administered (Vetergesic [Ceva] 20 μg/kg IV q8h) to provide analgesia.
The following day, 7 days after initial presentation, biopsies of the affected areas were taken. Biopsies from the head and ventral lesions identified locally extensive ulceration, covered with a thick layer of necrotic tissue. There was also extensive epidermal and adnexal necrosis with follicular and epidermal keratinocytes containing large, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, consistent with viral inclusion bodies. Bacteriology swabs taken from the lesions did not yield any bacterial growth.
Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable, with no evidence of pulmonary changes. Prior to biopsy results being obtained, a presumptive diagnosis of poxvirus was made and treatment with intravenous rFeIFN-ω (Virbagen Omega [Virbac] 1MU/kg SC q24h for 3 days) was commenced.
On day 9, some improvement had been seen in the cat's demeanour with a return of appetite. The lesions affecting the head had not progressed and no new lesions were noted. The central necrotic region remained static, with the subcutaneous swelling becoming softer on palpation. The cat was discharged later that day; the owner was informed of the zoonotic potential and appropriate measures to take.
The cat re-presented on day 12, with its appetite having reduced, resulting in difficulty administering oral medications. The cat was lethargic again. The cat was given intravenous rFeIFN-ω (as above) for a further 3 days. However, by day 14, de novo nodular lesions had developed on the neck, head and thoracic limbs. The ventrally necrotic region began expanding in size and the small raised papules were becoming more evident The following day, the cat became progressively obtunded and developed anisocoria. Given the limited response to treatment, and progression of clinical signs with CNS involvement, the owners elected for euthanasia.
A necropsy was performed at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. The eschar lesion was found to extend full thickness through the dermis (Figure 4 ). Quantitative PCR for CPxV was performed on this tissue, with high amounts of viral DNA identified. Histopathology of this lesion identified a complete loss of the epidermis, and expansion of the dermis with an inflammatory infiltrate dominated by macrophages, neutrophils (mature and degenerate) and occasional lymphocytes. There were extensive areas of cell necrosis with well-demarcated, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies ( Figure 5 ). The post-mortem examination also showed multifocal to coalescing, raised, alopecic and erythematous lesions affecting all four limbs. The lungs had multifocal areas of consolidation, with small quantities of white foam within the terminal bronchi. The pericardium was thickened with a moderately increased amount of pericardial fluid. As neurological changes were evident clinically, histopathology of the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum was performed. There was marked microgliosis of all areas, with many having abundant cytoplasm within them. Occasionally eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were identified ( Figure 5) .
The findings were consistent with multi-systemic disease with terminal neurological involvement, which has not been reported previously with CPxV infection.
These cases provide novel findings in that CPxV infection can infect and cause disease within the CNS, or present solely as a laryngeal mass, with the associated clinical signs, but no concomitant cutaneous or pulmonary pathology. As more cases of CPxV infection are published it is becoming apparent that this infection in cats can produce a number of differing presentations, and it should be considered a valid differential diagnosis in patients with a number of presentations.
Case 1 identified a novel presentation of CPxV infection, as a localised, focal form of disease affecting only the larynx and para-laryngeal area. This cat responded well to treatment and had no evidence of pulmonary pathology during investigations. This case shows that CPxV infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of focal disease of the respiratory tract, as well as the more commonly recognised cutaneous and lower respiratory presentations. Reported clinical signs for CPxV infection are typically skin lesions (commonly found on the head, neck and forelimbs) and, rarely, fatal necrotising pneumonia. 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] Interestingly, no skin lesions were evident in this casethis has previously been described in a single cat with CPxV pneumonia. 11 The lack of cutaneous pathology may reflect the fact that, in rare cases, the virus can be transmitted by the oronasal route. 12 Case 2 had classic dermatological signs, with no clinical or imaging findings consistent with pulmonary disease (although these were apparent on post-mortem There are also eosinophilic inclusion bodies found within the cytoplasm of the microglia (arrows), consistent with CPxV infection evaluation). This cat began to display neurological signs, consistent of sensorium changes, as well as anisocoria, likely secondary to viral infection of the CNS (with consistent findings on histopathology). This has not been reported in previous case series. From this case we now know that CPxV infection should remain a differential in cats with neurological signs, particularly if accompanied with dermatological and/or respiratory involvement.
Only case 2 presented with significant cutaneous pathology. These cases show the importance of taking a full history, as finding a cat with a history of outdoor access and a tendency to hunt rodents, alongside acute clinical signs that included coughing, pyrexia, and/or cutaneous changes, should suggest that CPxV infection should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis. It is essential that CPxV is considered as a differential diagnosis, and investigated, via cytology, histopathology and/or PCR of pulmonary aspirates or cutaneous lesions, in order that this potentially serious zoonotic infection can be identified at an early stage, the case treated appropriately, and with all necessary precautions taken.
The importance of CPxV-induced disease in cats is gaining increased recognition. In the autumn in which this manuscript was being prepared, the authors became aware of an increase in prevalence of CPxV in the UK, with particularly virulent characteristics. 13 With cutaneous and respiratory signs occurring relatively frequently with CPxV infection, it is important that clinicians recognise these signs, consider this potential differential diagnosis, perform appropriate diagnostics and commence appropriate management. This case series emphasises the need to consider CPxV in circumstances where there are not the classical signs, or where there is atypical body system involvement, be it neurological or upper respiratory.
To our knowledge, this is the first case series to describe laryngeal and neurological CPxV infections in the domestic cat. As we have identified, CPxV can cause focal laryngeal disease and as such should be considered as a zoonotic differential diagnosis for clinical signs pertaining to the upper respiratory tract.",Novel characteristics identified in two cases of feline cowpox virus infection,"Breheny, Craig R; Fox, Victoria; Tamborini, Alice; O’Halloran, Conor; Robertson, Elise; Cazzini, Paola; Birn-Jeffery, Daniela; Henkin, Julia; Schwarz, Tobias; Scase, Tim; Powell, Roger; Gunn-Moore, Danièlle",JFMS Open Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5528940/,97,1952,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1bfeba839c9c98eb6e49ceb13cfcdba28620a61d,"The first membrane-spanning domain (ml) of the M glycoprotein of avian coronavirus (formerly called El) is sufficient to retain this protein in the cis-Golgi. When the membrane-spanning domain of a protein which is efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane (VSV G protein) is replaced with ml, the resulting chimera (Gml) is retained in the Golgi (Swift, A. M., and C. E. Machamer. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 115:19-30). When assayed in sucrose gradients, we observed that Gml formed a large oligomer, and that much of this oligomer was SDS resistant and stayed near the top of the stacking gel of an SDSpolyacrylamide gel. The unusual stability of the oligomer allowed it to be detected easily. Gml mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the ml domain that were retained in the Golgi complex formed SDS-resistant oligomers, whereas mutants that were rapidly released to the plasma membrane did not. Oligomerization was not detected immediately after synthesis of Gml, but occurred gradually with a lag of ,',,10 rain, suggesting that it is not merely aggregation of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, oligomer-1. Abbreviations used in this paper: CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-cldorophenylhydrazone; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus.","ization did not occur under several conditions that block ER to Golgi transport. The lumenal domain was not required for oligomerization since another chimera (otmlG), where the lumenal domain of Gml was replaced by the o~ subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, also formed an SDS-resistant oligomer, and was able to form hetero-oligomers with Gml as revealed by coprecipitation experiments. SDS resistance was conferred by the cytoplasmic tail of VSV G, because proteolytic digestion of the tail in microsomes containing Gml oligomers resulted in loss of SDS resistance, although the protease-treated material continued to migrate as a large oligomer on sucrose gradients. Interestingly, treatment of cells with cytochalasin D blocked formation of SDS-resistant (but not SDS-sensitive) oligomers. Our data suggest that SDS-resistant oligomers form as newly synthesized molecules of Gml arrive at the Golgi complex and may interact (directly or indirectly) with an actinbased cytoskeletal matrix. The oligomerization of Gml and other resident proteins could serve as a mechanism for their retention in the Golgi complex.
T HE Golgi complex is the site of oligosaccharide processing and sorting for proteins that are destined for delivery to secretory granules, lysosomes, the plasma membrane, and the extracellular space. The Golgi-resident proteins that perform these functions must be retained in the Golgi despite the large amount of lipid and protein traffic through this organelle. Retention of these proteins is thought to involve recognition of positive signals that specify Golgi localization.
A useful model protein for studying Golgi retention signals has been the M glycoprotein (formerly called El) of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)k Coronaviruses bud into the intermediate compartment or Golgi complex of mammalian cells (Griffiths and Rottier, Please address all correspondence to Dr. Carolyn Machamer, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, 725 N. Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21205.
Dr. Ann M. Swifts current address is Smithkline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA. 1992). When cDNA encoding the M protein is expressed in animal cells, the protein is targeted to the cis-Golgi (Machamer et al., 1990) . Structurally, the IBV M protein consists of a short glycosylated amino-terminal domain, three membrane-spanning domains, and a long carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain. The first membrane-spanning domain (ml) of the M glycoprotein is sufficient to retain this protein in the Golgi (Machamer and Rose, 1987) . Furthermore, the ml domain can confer Golgi localization to a wellcharacterized plasma membrane protein (the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV G). VSV G is a type I membrane protein which is cotranslationally inserted into the ER, where it forms homotrimers. It is then rapidly transported through the Golgi complex (as determined by the kinetics of N-linked oligosaccharide processing) and delivered to the plasma membrane (for review see Doms et al., 1993) . When the membrane-spanning domain of VSV G is replaced with the ml domain of IBV M, the resulting chimera (Gml, see Fig. 1 ) is retained in the Golgi complex (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . Extensive mutagenesis suggests that at least four specific amino acids in the ml domain are critical for Golgi retention of Gml: asparagine 465, threonines 469 and 476, and glutamine 480 (Machamer et al., 1993) . Interestingly, these residues form an uncharged polar face along one side of the alpha helix predicted for ml. The polar nature of this face of the helix suggests that protein-protein interactions along this face may mediate Golgi retention of Gml.
There are two general ways to envision the specific retention of a protein by information contained within its transmembrane domain (for review see Machamer, 1991) . The first involves the recognition of this domain by a specific receptor that either blocks further movement in the exocytic pathway or retrieves escaped proteins back to the appropriate compartment. A receptor-based model also requires a mechanism for retention or recycling of the receptor itself. The second mechanism invokes changes in the tertiary or quaternary structure of the protein that are induced via the membrane-spanning domain when the protein encounters a particular microenvironment. Changes in protein structure could include oligomerization or aggregation (covalent or non-covalent) with other proteins or lipids, which would prevent movement of the protein into transport vesicles. The cis-Golgi may differ from the ER in lipid composition and divalent cation concentration. These changes in microenvironment could conceivably trigger a conformational shift in Golgi resident proteins upon their arrival in the appropriate compartment.
We have been investigating the mechanisms by which ml might mediate retention of Gml in the Golgi complex. We observed that Gml formed a large oligomer soon after synthesis when assayed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Here, we show that this oligomer is unusually stable, and that its formation correlates with arrival and retention in the Golgi complex. Our findings point to a possible role for oligomerization in the retention of Gml.
Aprotinin, colchicine, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), cytochalasin D, TPCK-trypsin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Sigma Chem. Co. (St. Louis, MO). Brefeldin A was from Epieentre Technologies (Madison, WI). Stock solutions of reagents were stored at -20°C.
COS-'/and HeLa cells were maintained in DME with 10 and 5% FCS, respectively. COS-7 cells plated in 35-mm dishes (40-70% confluent) were transfected with an SV40-based expression vector using DEAE-dextran (Machamer et al., 1985) . Expression was analyzed at 40--48 h posttransfection. For expression using the vaccinia-T7 system, HeLa cells (40-70% confluent) were infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 encoding T7 RNA polymerase (Fuerst et al., 1986 ) at a multiplicity of infection of 10-20. After adsorption for 30 min at 37°C, the inoculum was replaced with 0.75 ml of serum-free medium containing 2/~g of a vector (pAR2529) encoding the appropriate gene behind the T7 promoter and 5-10/~1 of the cationic lipid ~TransfectACE"" (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD; Rose et al., 1991) . Expression level was varied by changing the amount of DNA added per well (0.02-5 ~tg/dish). In coexpression experiments, cells were transfected with 1/~g of DNA encoding each construct. Expression was analyzed by metabolic labeling starting 3 h after infection.
Gml and related mutants were generated using the Kunkel method of oligonucleotide-direeted mutagenesis as described previously (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Machamer et al., 1993) . Point mutants were named by appending the original amino acid (in single letter code) followed by the new amino acid. ,m (Guan et al., 1988a) and TMR (Doms et al., 1988) were obtained from Jack Rose (Yale University). Construction of ,~mlG was described previously (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . tGml was constructed from Gml by inserting a stop codon at position 487 using site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) .
Indirect immunofluorescence staining of transiently transfected COS-7 ceils was performed as described (Machamer and Rose, 1987; Machamer and Rose, 1988) . Gml and related mutants were detected using a monoclonal anti-VSV G antibody (5/~g/ml; Lefrancois and Lyles, 1982) followed by Texas red-conjugated, affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (10 /zg/ml; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc., Avondale, PA).
Cells expressing VSV G or mutant G proteins were rinsed once with PBS, starved for 15 rain in methionine-free DME, and labeled for the indicated times with 100 #Ci/ml Trans35S-Label (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA) or L-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) in serum-free, methionine-free DME. Cells were solubilized immediately or after the appropriate chase period in serum-free DME containing a threefold excess of unlabeled methionine. Cells were lysed in detergent solution (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 62.5 mM EDTA, and 0.13 TIU/ml aprotinin). Samples were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-VSV antibody (produced by immunization of rabbits with purified VSV) and fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., San Diego, CA). After heating to 100*C for 3 rain in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5 % fl-mercaptoethanol, samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (Laemmli, 1970) . Marker proteins were 14C-methylated standard molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.). Labeled proteins were detected by fluorography (Bonner and Laskey, 1974) . am chimeras were radiolabeled and solubilized as above but immunoprecipitated using anti-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) antibody (Organon Teknika-Cappel, West Chester, PA) and electrophoresed on 12 % SDS-pelyacrylamide gels.
Brefeldin A (5 /tg/ml final concentration) was diluted into serum-free medium from a 5 mg/ml stock in ethanol immediately before use. Colehicine (25 mM) was prepared in DMSO, diluted 1:10 into serum-free, methionine-free medium, and added to cells (50 ~tM final concentration) starting 1 h before metabolic labeling. Cytochalasin D (0.1 M in DMSO) was added to cells (100/~M final concentration) 2 h after infection and ineluded in subsequent changes of medium. An equal volume of DMSO was added to control cells. In experiments involving cell treatment with CCCP, ceils were starved in glucose-, methionine-, and cysteine-free medium for 15 rain before metabolic labeling in the same medium for 5 win. CCCP (0.1 M stock in DMSO) was added at the beginning of the chase in glucosefree medium to a final concentration of 300 #M.
HeLa cells were transfected, metabolically labeled for 15 min, and chased for 45 rain as described above. Cells were rinsed three times in PBS supplemented with 1 lnM MgCI2 and 0.1 mM CaC12, and then biotinylated using sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford, IL) as described (Lisanti et al., 1988) . Cells were then solubilized as described above and Gml and related proteins immunoprecipitated. Samples were eluted from the S. aureus pellets by heating to 100°C in 50/~1 10 mM ""Iris, 50 mM NaC1, 1% SDS, pH 7.4, and divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was kept at -20°C (""total"") while the other was diluted tenfold with 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCI, pH 7.4, and incubated with streptavidin-coupled agarose beads (Pierce Chem. Co.) for 60 min at 4""C. The streptavidin beads were then pelleted and washed three times in RIPA buffer. Non-biotinylated proteins in the supernatant were precipitated using ""I~A. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography.
Oligomerization of the Gml protein was analyzed by velocity gradient centrifugetion in sucrose performed essentially as described (Doms et al., 1987) . Continuous 5-20% (wt/wt) sucrose gradients were poured over a 60% (wt/wt) sucrose cushion (0.4 nil) in SW50.1 tubes. All solutions were in MNT (100 mM NaCI, 20 mM Tris, 30 mM MES, pH 5.8) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. HeLa cells expressing either VSV G or Gml were metabolically labeled for 5 min and harvested (in MNT containing 1% Triton X-100) either immediately or after 60 min of chase. Lysates were loaded on top of the gradients and spun at 44-45,000 rpm for 15-16 h. Fractions (0.35 ml) were collected from the top using a Buchler Auto Densi-Flow IIC, immunoprecipitated with anti-VSV antibody, and electrophoresed to determine the location of the proteins in the gradient. For estimating the size of the oligomer, gradients (5-20% sucrose [wt/wt] in 100 mM NaC1, 50 mM Tris, pH 5.8, 0.1% Triton X-100) were spun at 47000 rpm for 4 h. The markers used were thyroglobulin (19.3 $20,,0) and eatalase (11.3 $20,,0).
Microsomes were prepared after metabolic labeling and the appropriate chase period from transfected HeLa cells plated in 6-cm dishes. Cells were rinsed in PBS and swelled in 0.8 ml swelling buffer (10 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCi, t mM MgCI2, pH 7.4) for 5 rain on ice. After scraping with a rubbet policeman, 0.25 ml swelling buffer containing 40% sucrose (wt/vol) was added, and the cells were homogenized in a I ml Dounce homogenizer with 60 strokes of the A pestle. Lysates were centrifuged briefly (90 s 5,000 rpm) to remove nuclei and large debris. 0.3 ml swelling buffer containing 10% sucrose (wt/vol) was added, and the lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge (T100.2 rotor). Pellets were resuspended gently in PBS and divided into two aiiquots. TPCK-Trypsin (20/~g) was added to one aliquot, and both were incubated at 37""C for 30 min. Proteolytic digestion was stopped by adding 20 #g of soybean trypsin inhibitor to both tubes. Samples were solubilized (in detergent solution containing 0.4% SDS or in MNT as noted) and processed further as described in the text and figure legends.
Previous studies from this laboratory showed that the first membrane span (ml) of the M glycoprotein of 1BV (previously called the E1 glycoprotein) causes the chimeric protein Gml to be retained in the Golgi. The sequence of ml is shown in Fig. 1 A. Using site directed mutagenesis, four key residues in the ml domain were shown to be critical for Golgi retention of Gml: asparagine (N,65), two threonines (T~ and T,76), and glutamine (Q~). Some substitutions at Q~0 are tolerated (e.g., GmlQI'hs0) whereas other changes (e.g., GmlQI~o) result in transport of the protein to the cell surface (Machamer et al., 1993) . Another mutation in which two isoleucine residues were inserted near the center of the transmembrane domain (Gmli,~) also disrupts retention in the Golgi complex. These three chimeric proteins (GmL~, GmlQLso, and GmlQH_~o) were expressed in transiently transfected COS-'/ cells and localized by indirect immunofluorescence ( Fig. 1 B) . VSV G and GrnlQI~o were readily detected at the plasma membrane, while Gml and GmlQI-hso were detected only in the Golgi region and largely colocalized with lens culinaris lectin staining, even after treatment with nocodazole or brefeldin A (Machamer et al., 1993) . Gmlin~ staining was less prominent at the plasma membrane than GmlQI~0, and a considerable amount of fluorescence was detected in the Golgi complex. The localizations of these proteins were confirmed in HeLa cells and BHK cells transfected using a vaccinia-virusmediated expression system (not shown).
Interestingly, when we analyzed expression of these constructs in HeLa cells and COS-7 cells by metabolic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation, we noticed the appearance of a radiolabeled SDS-resistant species that migrated at the top of the stacking gel, in addition to products migrating at the expected molecular masses. The material at the top of the stacking gel was more prevalent in samples immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells ( Fig. 1 C) than in those from COS-7 cells ( Fig. 1 D) . This species was present only in immunoprecipitates from cells that expressed mutants with Golgi-resident populations (Gml, Gmli,, and GmlQH4s0) and it appeared regardless of the level of expression (over a >50-fold range). Although ~50% of the total radioactivity immunoprecipitated from Gml-expressing HeLa cells migrated at the top of the stacking gel, we have not quantitated this information routinely. One problem with quantitation is that this material could include radiolabeled components other than Gml; furthermore, some of the oligomer may not enter the gel at all and be lost during subsequent processing. Gmli,, was previously reported to move through the Golgi complex rapidly (with a half time of 35 rain in COS-7 cells; Swift and Machamer, 1991) . However, the kinetics of transport reflect only the population of protein that enters the separating gel. The SDS-resistant protein may therefore represent a stable Golgi-resident pool.
The SDS-resistant oligomerization did not depend on the type of cells used for expression, since the same results were found using transiently transfected BHK cells and stably transfected CHO cells (not shown). Because the SDSresistant material was easiest to detect in HeLa cells, we used these cells for subsequent experiments. The material at the top of the stacking gel could be detected after transfer to nitrocellulose and probing with anti-VSV G antibodies by immunoblotting, suggesting that it contained Gml (or the related constructs; data not shown). Furthermore, this large species was efficiently precipitated by several conformationsensitive anti-VSV G monoclonal antibodies that do not recognize grossly misfolded proteins (Doms et ai., 1988) . We tried to solubilize the Gml oligomer using a wide variety of lysis conditions and sample treatments. None of the modifications we tested, including changes in salt concentration, reducing agents, detergents, chaotropic agents (e.g., urea, guanidinium HC1), or temperature of solubilization or sample elution disrupted the SDS-resistant oligomer (data not shown). A very small amount of SDS-sensitive Gml could be produced when the top of the stacking gel (containing the SDS-resistant oligomer) was isolated after electrophoresis, placed in the well of a fresh gel, and reelectrophoresed (not shown). Together, these observations suggest that SDS-resistant oligomer formation is an intrinsic property of Gml and mutant Gml proteins that are retained in the Golgi complex, but not of mutants that efficiently reach the plasma membrane. 
If the oligomerized protein represents a distinct intracellular pool of protein(s), it should not be susceptible to cell surface biotinylation. Moreover, we predicted that an oligomer that formed nonspecifically after cell solubilization would be precipitated by streptavidin since incorporation of a few biotinylated molecules would allow precipitation of the entire oligomer. HeLa cells expressing Gml, VSV G, or Gmlin, were metabolically labeled for 15 min, and then chased for 45 min before cell-surface biotinylation with sulfo-NHSbiotin. After immunoprecipitation, an aliquot of each sample was treated with streptavidin-coupled agarose, and biotinylated and non-biotinylated proteins were recovered and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) . Under these conditions, ,o50% of the total VSV G was biotinylated and could be recovered in the streptavidin pellet. Only the mature (sialylated) form of VSV G was recovered in this fraction, suggesting that biotinylation was indeed restricted to cell surface proteins. In contrast, essentially none of the Gml was precipitated by streptavidin, suggesting that this protein remained in an intracellular compartment. A small amount of SDS-sensitive Gmli~, was recovered in the streptavidin pellet. More importantly, no SDS-resistant material was biotinylated, suggesting that the SDS-resistant Gmli~ constitutes an intracellular (perhaps Golgi-resident) pool that is distinct from the SDS-sensitive protein, and that only a portion of Gml~, is transported to the plasma membrane where it can be biotinylated. This result strongly suggested that oligomer formation occurs before cell solubilization.
The time course of Gml oligomerization was determined. HeLa cells expressing Gml were metabolically labeled for 5 min, chased for the indicated times, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with anti-VSV G antibody (Fig. 3) . Oligo- Figure 2 . SDS-resistant oligomers are not subject to cell surface biotinylation. Ceils were metabolically radiolabeled for 15 min, and then chased for 60 rain. Cell surface-specific biotinylatiun was performed at 4""C using sulfo-NHS-biotin, and the cells were solubilized and immunopreeipitated with anti-VSV antibody. The bound protein was eluted from S. aureus pellets and divided in half. One aliquot was solubilized in sample buffer (T), and the remainder was incubated with streptavidin-coupled agarose beads. The supematant (IS], unbound material) was collected and TCA precipitated, and the streptavidin beads (P) were washed and solubilized before SDS-gel electrophoresis. merization was not detected immediately after synthesis of Gml, but occurred gradually with a lag of ~10 min.
The kinetics of Gml oligomer formation were consistent with the time at which newly synthesized proteins arrive at the cis-Golgi. To determine if oligomerization occurred in a post-ER compartment, we asked whether the SDSresistant oligomer would form when ER to Golgi traffic was blocked by incubation at 16°C. At this temperature, newly synthesized proteins accumulate in the intermediate compartment (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) . HeLa cells were transfected with constructs encoding Gml or VSV G, metabolically radiolabeled for 5 min, and then chased at 16 or 37°C as indicated for up to 90 min (Fig. 4) . No oligomer formed when cells expressing Gml were chased at 160C; however, if cells chased at 16°C were subsequently transferred to 370C, oligomer formation occurred. In separate experiments, we found that the kinetics of oligomer formation at 37°C were unaffected by the inclusion of a 160C pretreatment step (data not shown). In addition, treatment with 0.3 mM CCCP during the chase period also inhibited SDS-resistant oligomer formation (not shown). This treatment blocks transport of newly synthesized proteins from the ER. These experiments suggested that Gml oligomer formation normally occurred in a post-ER compartment. However, brefeldin A pretreatment (or treatment during chase) did not block oligomer formation (not shown), although it did cause redistribution of Gml to an ER-like pattern (Machamer et al., 1993) .
To ask if Gml oligomerization was an artifact generated during SDS-PAGE, we analyzed oligomer formation using velocity gradient sedimentation in sucrose (Doms et al., 198% Gml does not occur at 16°C. Transfected HeLa cells were metabolically radiolabeled for 5 min, and then chased at 16 or 37°C for up to 90 rain. One set of dishes was incubated for 90 min at 16°C, then transferred to 37°C for 60 min. VSV G and related proteins were immunoprecipitated from solubilized cells as described in Materials and Methods. 1988 ). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with VSV G or Gml, and then metabolically radiolabeled for 5 min and solubilized either immediately or after 60 min of chase. Lysates were loaded onto 5-20% sucrose gradients, centrifuged, and analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. Immediately after synthesis, VSV G migrated as a 4S20.~ peak (Fig. 5; Doms et al., 1987) . After a 60-min chase, all of the VSV G had trimerized, migrating as a discrete 8S20,~ peak. The behavior of Gml in these gradients was markedly different. Immediately after synthesis, Gml migrated similarly to the VSV G monomer. After a 60-rain chase, however, much of the Gml was found in the pellet in an SDS-resistant form ( Fig. 5 ; note top of lane). The timedependent shift in the mobility of the oligomer in sucrose gradients suggests that oligomers already exist in the cells at the time of lysis and immunoprecipitation. The SDSsensitive material in the Gml pellet fractions may represent an intermediate form of oligomer that is not yet SDSresistant. Alternatively, this material could contain protein released from the SDS-resistant oligomer during SDS-PAGE. In contrast to our findings with Gml, misfolded mutants of VSV G that aggregate in the ER are found in the pellet (and are SDS-soluble) immediately after synthesis (Doms et al., 1988) . Using different centrifugation conditions, we estimated the average size of the Gml oligomer to be approximately 22S20.~, or roughly 800 kD (data not shown). Therefore, if Gml (MW 66 kD) is the sole component of the oligomer, we estimate there would be ,o12 molecules per oligomer.
In contrast to the chimeric Gml protein, oligomers of the IBV M glycoprotein are not detected when assayed by sucrose gradient sedimentation (data not shown). This might suggest that oligomerization is not a retention mechanism for native M protein; alternatively, M oligomers might readily dissociate in detergent. The resistance of the Gml oligomer to solubilization suggests a structural feature of VSV G may stabilize the complex. We asked whether the lumenal domain of VSV G, which is sufficient for trimerization (Doms et al., 1988) , was required for oligomer formation. To do this, we replaced the lumenal domain ofVSV G or Gml with a small soluble glycoprotein, the o~ subunit of hCG. When expressed alone, the oL subunit of hCG is secreted from cells as a monomer (Guan et al., 1988b) . When hCGo~ is fused to the membrane-spanning domain and cytoplasmic tail of VSV G, the chimeric protein (c~m) is membrane-bound and transported to the cell surface (Guan et al., 1988a) . When the VSV G membrane-spanning domain of c~m is replaced with the ml domain of IBV M, the resulting chimera (oemlG) is retained in the Golgi complex (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . Interestingly, in metabolically labeled HeLa cells expressing cxmlG, we observed the time-dependent accumulation of an SDS-resistant species at the interface between the separating and stacking gels (Fig. 6, arrowhead) . This species was not observed in cells expressing am. The smaller l~gure 5. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of Gml and VSV G. HeLa cells transfected with VSV G or Gml were metabolically labeled for 5 rain, and then solubilized immediately or after 60 rain of chase. Lysates were loaded onto 5-20% sucrose gradients and centrifuged as described in Materials and Methods. Fractions were collected, immunoprecipitated using anti-VSV antibody, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After the 60-min chase, all of the Gml formed a large oligomer that pelleted under these gradient conditions, and much of it was SDS-resistant. size of the otmlG SDS-resistant oligomer is consistent with the size difference between ctmlG and Gml (28 vs 66 kD). On sucrose gradients, c~mlG solubilized 60 min after synthesis migrated as a larger species (some of which was SDSresistant) than newly synthesized oanlG. In contrast, the mobility of o~m on sucrose gradients was unaltered during the chase (data not shown). Thus the VSV G lumenal domain was not required for SDS-resistant oligomer formation.
We used a coprecipitation assay to ask if otmlG formed hetero-oligomers with Gml or other related Golgi-resident proteins. HeLa cells were cotransfected to express both otmlG and either Gml, Gmlins, or VSV G. After a short metabolic labeling period (5 min), cells were solubilized either immediately or after a 60-min chase. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-hCG antibody. When otmlG was expressed alone, the time-dependent accumulation of SDS-resistant oligomer at the gel interface (arrowhead) was observed as described above (Fig. 7, lane 2) . Interestingly, when otmlG was coexpressed with Gml or Gmlins, the size of the oligomer shifted dramatically, and now migated at the top of the stacking gel (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 8) . Furthermore, some proteins appeared to be solubilized during electrophoresis, since a small amount of material migrating with authentic Gml and Gmlins w a s alSO detected in these lanes (Fig. 7, arrow) . In contrast, no change in the size of the oligomer was observed when c~mlG was coexpressed with VSV G (Fig. 7, lane 6 ) or with GmlQLs0 (data not shown), which are transported to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, when cells expressing Gml and c~m (containing the VSV G membrane-spanning domain) were immunoprecipitated using anti-hCG antibody, no Gml was recovered (data not shown).
To test the role of the cytoplasmic tail of Gml in oligomer formation, we inserted a stop codon after the first residue (Arg) beyond the transmembrane domain (tGml). The corresponding tailless VSV G (TMR; Doms et al., 1988) trimerizes with normal kinetics but is transported slowly from the ER to the plasma membrane. When tGml was localized by Figure 6 . amlG forms an SDS-resistant oligomer. HeLa cells transfected with amlG or am were metabolically labeled for 5 rain, and then solubilized either immediately or after a 60-min chase and immunoprecipitated with anti-hCG antibody. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15 % gels. Note the time-dependent accumulation of an SDS-resistant species at the interface between the separating and stacking gels (arrowhead). The increased mobility of amlG and am after 60 min of chase is due to carbohydrate trimming.
indirect immunofluorescence in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, some Golgi staining was observed, although a significant amount of the protein was found in the ER. Unlike Grid, tGml did not form an SDS-resistant oligomer when expressed in COS-'/or HeLa cells, and did not sediment as a large oligomer in sucrose gradients (although it did apparently form trimers, not shown). However, because tGml appears to exit the ER very slowly (like TMR), the kinetics of oligomer formation may have been too slow to detect.
Because tGml did not form detectable oligomers, we asked whether preformed Gml oligomers could be disrupted by proteolysis of the cytoplasmic tall. The 29-amino acid Figure 7 . Gml and c~mlG form hetero-oligomers. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 #g each of mlllG and either calf thymus DNA (CT), Gml, VSV G, or Gml~n~. After a 5-min pulse, cells were solubilized either immediately or after a 60-min chase. Aliquots of the solubilized cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-hCG antibody and elcctrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The interface between the stacking and separating gels is marked with an arrowhead, and the mobility of Gml in the gel is denoted with an arrow, amIG forms hetero-oligomers with Gml and Gmlm (but not with VSV G) that could be precipitated by anti-hCG antibody. Fig. 8 A) has numerous arginines and lysines that are susceptible to proteolysis by trypsin. HeLa cells expressing Gml or VSV G were metabolically radiolabeled for 5 min, and then chased for 0 or 60 rain, and microsomes prepared as described in Materials and Methods. Microsomes were treated with TICK-trypsin for 30 rain at 37°C, and then solubilized, immunoprecipitated with anti-VSV antibody, and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 8 B) . As size standards we used radiolabeled tGml and TMR immunoprecipitated from transfected HeLa cells. Trypsin cleaved newly synthesized VSV G protein to a species migrating slightly larger than TMR on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8 B, compare  lanes 7 and 10) . After 60 rain of chase, two proteolytic products were detected. The upper band corresponded to cleavage of the cytoplasmic tail of mature (sialylated) VSV G, as it was resistant to endoglycosidase H, whereas the lower band was sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment (not shown). In addition, we frequently observed some residual Gml or VSV G were metabolically labeled for 5 rain, and then chased for 0 or 60 rain. Microst,mes were prepared as described in Materials and Methods and treated with 20 #g TPCK-trypsin (lanes 2, 4, 7, and 9) or mock treated (lanes 1, 3, 6, and 8) for 30 min at 37""C. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (20/zg), the microsomes were solubilized, and Gml (lanes 1-4) and VSV G 0anes 6-9) were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. More inside-out microsomes are generated from compartments further along the secretory pathway, accounting for the loss of material recovered after trypsinization of VSV G isolated after a 60-min chase (lane 9). tGml (lane 5) and TMR (lane 10) immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells labeled under the same conditions are included as size standards.
uncleaved mature VSV G in our experiments. Since the trypsin-cleaved form of VSV G migrated more slowly than T M R (whose tail contains a single amino acid), we deduced that trypsin cleaves the VSV G tall within region A marked on Fig. 8 A. The proteolytic profile generated by trypsin cleavage of Gml differed from that of VSV G. Trypsin treatment of Figure 9 . Trypsin-treated Gml is still oligomerized. Cells expressing VSV G (A) or Gml (B) were metabolically radiolabeled for 5 rain, and then chased for 45 rain. Microsomes were prepared and treated with 20/zg TICK-trypsin for 30 rain at 37°C, then solubilized in MNT and centrifuged on 5-20% sucrose gradients. Fractions were collected, immunoprecipitated using anti-VSV antibody, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
newly synthesized Gml yielded a single species which migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE than the VSV G proteolyric fragment. Thus, even before oligomers are formed, the tail of Gml is less accessible to trypsin than that of VSV G. Interestingly, when Gml was digested after a 60-rain chase, there was a large reduction in the amount of SDS-res",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stant oligomer migrating at the top of the stacking gel on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8 B, compare lanes 3 and 4) . Furthermore, we saw a second, larger band in addition to the one detected immediately after the pulse label. Both bands were endoglycosidase H-sensitive, indicating that the proteins they represent had not passed through the medial Golgi (not shown). In more detailed kinetic experiments, the amount of this upper band increased with longer chase times, with a concomitant decrease in the amount of the lower band (not shown). Based on the potential trypsin cleavage sites in the Figure 10 . Trypsin treatment of Gml and VSV G recovered after treatment with cytochalasin D. HeLa cells expressing Gml or VSV G were treated with 100 #M cytochalasin D starting 1 h before radiolabeling. Because fewer microsomes were recovered from cytochalasin D-treated cells than from untreated ceils, treated cells were radiolabeled with twice the usual concentration of radioactivity. Microsomes were prepared after a 15-min pulse and a 45-min chase, and aliquots were mock treated or treated with TPCK-trypsin as described in Materials and Methods. Gml and VSV G were immunoprecipitated using anti-VSV antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cytochalasin D blocked formation of SDS-resistant oligomers and accumulation of the larger trypsin-cleaved band.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cytoplasmic tail and the relative mobility of these bands compared to the VSV G proteolytic fragment and tGml, we conclude that the upper and lower bands result from trypsin cleavage within regions C and B, respectively (Fig. 8 A) . The upper band may represent material generated exclusively from proteolytic digestion of SDS-resistant Gml. This would suggest that the last three amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of Gml are required for SDS resistance of the oligomer. Alternatively, trypsin may destroy another (unlabeled) component of the oligomer that is required to maintain its resistance to solubilization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trypsinization of microsomes eliminated the SDS-resistant form of Gml. To ask if proteolysis dissociated the oligomers as well, we subjected trypsin-treated Gml-containing microsomes to sucrose gradient sedimentation. Microsomes prepared from HeLa cells after a 5-min pulse and a 60-min chase were mock-treated or treated with TPCK-trypsin (20 #g) for 30 min at 37°C. Samples were diluted tenfold in MNT, and aliquots were loaded on sucrose gradients and centrifuged as described in Materials and Methods. Gradient fractions were collected, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The trypsin-treated samples are shown in Fig. 9 . Trypsin digestion did not cause dissociation of VSV G trimers (compare Fig. 9 A with Fig. 5) . Significantly, the larger proteolytic product of Gml migrated at the bottom of the gradient, whereas some of the smaller product pelleted and some was found throughout the gradient (Fig. 9 B) . This suggested that removing part of the cytoplasmic tail of Gml does not disrupt the oligomer, and further supports the possibility that digestion of SDS-resistant material gives rise to the larger band.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We tested the possibility of cytoskeletal involvement in SDS resistance of Gml by pretreating cells with drugs that disrupt microtubules or actin filaments. Depolymerization of microtubules with colchicine (50/~M) had no effect on the amount of SDS-resistant Gml formed (not shown). Interestingly, treatment with cytochalasin D (100/zM) starting 1 h before metabolic labeling blocked formation of SDS-resistant Gml oligomers (Fig. 10, lane 3) . The amount of immunoprecipitated radiolabel migrating at the top of the stacking gel decreased from 43 % of total in untreated cells to 18 % of total in cytochalasin D-treated cells (compare Fig. 10 , lanes I and 3). Cytochalasin D did not block the transport of VSV G since the rate of sialylation was enhanced relative to untreated cells. On sucrose gradients, Gml solubilized from cytochalasin D-treated cells migrated as an SDS-sensitive oligomer (in the pellet), and VSV G trimerization was unaffected (data not shown). This observation suggests that oligomer formation and SDS-resistance are separable characteristics, and furthermore implies that SDS-resistance may result from interaction between Gml and an actin-based matrix or cytoskeleton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because cytochalasin D blocked the formation of SDSresistant oligomers of Gml, we tested whether this treatment prevented the appearance of the larger proteolytic band. HeLa cells expressing Gml or VSV G were treated with cytochalasin D (100/zM) for 1 h before a 15-min metabolic labeling. Microsomes were prepared after a 45-min chase and mock-treated or treated with 20/zg of TPCK-trypsin for 30 min at 37°C, and then solubilized and immunoprecipitated using anti-VSV antibody (Fig. 10) . As mentioned above, treatment with cytochalasin D enhanced the fraction ofVSV G that became sialylated during this period (compare lanes 5 and 7). We routinely observed that trypsin degraded most of the VSV G recovered from cytochalasin D-treated cells (lane 8), suggesting that the orientation or durability of microsomes was affected by treatment with this perturbant. Interestingly, trypsin digestion of Gml recovered from cytochalasin D-treated cells yielded predominantly the smaller proteolytic species, generated by cleavage within region B in Fig. 8 A. We therefore conclude that the larger Gml species does indeed represent material digested from SDSresistant oligomers, and furthermore, that the oligomers may interact with an actin-based cytoskeleton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The experiments presented here support protein oligomerization as a mechanism for retaining the chimeric protein Gml in the Golgi complex. An unusual feature of the Gml oligomer (its resistance to solubflization by SDS) allowed us to easily assay oligomer formation. The specificity of oligomerization was mediated by the ml transmembrane domain, since mutant Gml proteins that were retained in the Golgi formed oligomers, while mutant proteins that were released to the plasma membrane did not. This specificity was preserved in another construct, otmlG, in which the lumenal domain of VSV G was replaced with the o~ subunit of hCG. Furthermore, e~mlG was able to form hetero-oligomers with Gml and other Golgi-resident Gml mutants, but not with mutants that move to the plasma membrane. This suggested that the lumenal domain of VSV G was not required for oligomerization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the specificity of oligomerization was dictated by the sequence of the membrane-spanning region, the cytoplasmic tail of Gml was necessary for SDS-resistance and may play a role in oligomer formation. When the cytoplasmic tails of preexisting oligomers were digested with trypsin, the proteolytic products were soluble in SDS but continued to migrate as oligomers on sucrose gradients. Based on potential trypsin cleavage sites in the cytoplasmic tail of Gml and the migration of the proteolytic fragments on SDS-PAGE, it is possible that removal of the last three carboxyterminal residues of Gml destroys its resistance to solubilization by SDS. Alternatively, trypsin digestion could remove another component of the oligomer that is required for SDS resistance. Interestingly, cell treatment with cytochalasin D blocked the formation of SDS-resistant oligomers, suggesting that the acquisition of SDS resistance may reflect association of the Gml cytoplasmic tail with an actin-based cytoskeleton. We are currently constructing a series of Gml proteins with truncated cytoplasmic tails to determine if these proteins are correctly targeted and form oligomers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Several observations suggest that Gml oligomerization normally occurs after the protein leaves the ER. Oligomerization of Gml was not detected until ~10 min after protein synthesis, which correlates with arrival of newly synthesized proteins at the cis-Golgi. Oligomers were not observed when ER to Golgi traffic was blocked by incubation at 16°C or treatment with CCCP. Interestingly, SDS-resistant oligomers did form in brefeldin A-treated cells, suggesting that oligomers can form in pre-Golgi compartments under certain conditions. Brefeldin A treatment may generate the conditions required to stimulate oligomer formation in the ER. Conditions which could trigger Gml oligomerization might include its concentration in the membrane, the retrieval of glycolipids or glycoproteins typical of the Golgi complex, or changes in pH or divalent ion concentrations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were unable to solubilize the SDS-resistant oligomer using a wide variety of harsh conditions. It is possible that some of the Gml oligomer is covalently crosslinked to itself or to an actin-based structure via the VSV G tail. However, removal of as few as three amino acids from the cytoplasmic tail resulted in oligomers that were SDS-sensitive. This indicates that the SDS resistant phenotype (which requires the last three amino acids of Gml) can be separated from oligomerization per se, which is mediated by the membranespanning domain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The transmembrane domains of many proteins have been shown to mediate dimerization (Sternberg and Gullick, 1990; Manolios et al., 1990 ; for review see Bormann and Engelman, 1992) . The best example is glycophorin A, whose single transmembrane domain interacts to form homodimers (Bormann et al., 1989) . This dimer is resistant to solubilization by SDS at ambient temperature, although resistance is overcome by dilution or incubation at higher temperatures (Furthmayr and Marchesi, 1976) . Dimerization ofglycophorin A is highly sequence specific and appears to involve interactions between hydrophobic residues in the transmembrane domain (Lemmon et al., 1992) . The transmembrane domains of the T-cell receptor (Cosson et al., 1991) and of class H major histocompatibility complex molecules also appear to mediate dimer formation (Cosson and Bonifacino, 1992) . In the case of major histocompatibility complex molecules, o~ and/~ chains interact to form heterodimers; dimerization appears to require a pair of oppositely charged amino acids at the lumenal edge of the apposing membrane spans. A series of glycine residues on each membrane span forms a nonpolar face which allows close packing of the transmembrane domains (Cosson and Bonifacino, 1992) . Similarly, the o~ chain of the T-cell receptor assembles with the CD3 6 chain via interaction between charged transmembrane residues (Manolios et al., 1990; Cosson et al., 1991) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is not clear how the transmembrane domain of Gml molecules might interact to form a large oligomer. The large lumenal domain of Gml may sterically prevent direct interaction between many transmembrane domains to form an oligomer. Furthermore, the polar face of the ml domain itself could be expected to interact with at most one or two similar domains. The transmembrane domains of these proteins might interact to form small clusters (dimers or trimers) of Gml, mutant Gml proteins, and ~mlG. These clusters could be organized into large arrays by interactions between the heads and/or tails of proteins in different clusters. These structures might contain lipids and other endogenous Golgi-resident proteins. Association into such an array could prevent Golgi-resident proteins from entering transport vesicles and thereby function as a mechanism for their retention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The targeting signals of other Golgi resident proteins from different Golgi subcompartments also reside in their transmembrane domains (Aoki et al., 1992; Burke et al., 1992; Colley et al., 1992; Munro, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1991; Russo et al., 1992; Tang et al., 1992; Teasdale et al., 1992; Wont et al., 1992) , although flanking domains also contribute to retention efficiency. No obvious homologies exist between the primary sequences of these membrane-spanning domains, even in enzymes thought to be enriched in the same subcompartment. Thus, the membrane composition of Golgi subcompartments may be responsible for specific retention of resident proteins throughout this organelle. Consistent with this, no soluble resident Golgi proteins have been detected to date. Nilsson et al. (1993) have proposed that the cytoplasmic tails of resident proteins in sequential Golgi stacks may in-teract (perhaps via a cytoplasmic linking protein) to maintain the stacks in close apposition. The formation of Gml oligomers may reflect association with such endogenous structures. The combination of overexpression and our metabolic radiolabeling conditions would not be expected to reveal any long-lived endogenous Golgi-resident proteins that also reside in the oligomer. However," longer radiolabeling conditions in stable cell lines expressing Gml may reveal other putative components of the oligomer. We are currently performing such experiments.""",Oligomerization of a membrane protein correlates with its retention in the Golgi complex,,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119850/,198,7005,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to determine whether hospitals in Japan have infection control manuals, and investigate the contents of manuals, consulting systems, and isolation facilities for emergency departments.
Methods: A total of 517 hospitals certified as educational institutions for board-certified acute care physicians in Japan were requested between March and May 2015 to provide a written evaluation of the infection control in the emergency department.
Results: A total of 51 of 303 (16.8%) hospitals had no manuals regarding infection control in the emergency department. Among 250 hospitals having emergency department manuals, 115 (46.0%) did not include contents regarding disinfection and sterilization for imaging examination rooms, and only 44 (17.6%) had criteria for contacting the emergency medical service when patients are suspected of, or diagnosed with, communicable diseases. Of the 303 hospitals, 277 (91.4%) prepared specific manuals for the 2009 pandemic influenza. Of the 303 hospitals, 80 (26.4%) did not prepare manuals for the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa in 2014. Furthermore, 92 (30.4%) of the 303 hospitals did not have any negative-pressure isolation rooms.
Conclusions: Practices and guidelines necessary for infection control in the emergency department were not sufficiently covered in the hospitals studied. Education, information sharing, and a checklist for preparing manuals are needed to establish better infection control systems in emergency departments.","E MERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE the entrance to hospitals for all patients with diseases or injuries, including emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Some infectious diseases cause risks for secondary infection in health-care providers and other patients, 1 and most patients with infectious diseases are not diagnosed before admission. Patients with multidrug-resistant organisms admitted to the emergency department could cause a hospital outbreak. 2 Infection control in the emergency department is important for risk management in hospitals and regions. Various infectious disease outbreaks have recently occurred around the world, including severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, 3 pandemic influenza worldwide in 2009, 1 Ebola virus disease in West Africa in 2014, 4 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Korea in 2015. 5 It was reported that 31 patients contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome from exposure in the emergency department at a university hospital in Taiwan. 3 A single patient admitted to an emergency department in Korea caused the Korean outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015. 5 These reports suggest that emergency departments can be key locations for the spread of emerging infectious diseases. However, in the abovementioned cases, the appropriateness of preparation, triage, and treatment in the emergency departments have not been reviewed. Few clinical guidelines for infection control in emergency departments have been established, 6 and not all institutions have their own manuals. In addition, current situations and issues related to infection control in emergency departments have not been examined or recognized. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM)-certified hospitals have infection control manuals for the emergency department, and to investigate manual contents, consulting systems, and isolation facilities. The results could contribute to establishing essential lists for preparing infection control manuals for emergency departments.
T HIS SURVEY WAS undertaken by the committee for infection control for the emergency department (JAAM) and a joint working group. Some emergency departments in Japan have inpatient units. However, this study focused on the outpatient unit of emergency departments. A total of 517 hospitals certified as educational institutions for board-certified acute care physicians in Japan (JAAM-certified hospitals) received a written request between March and May 2015 to provide written evaluation of infection control in the emergency department. The questionnaire (Table S1 ) covered the following: (i) demographics of the hospitals, (ii) contents of infection control manuals for emergency departments, (iii) consulting systems between emergency departments and infection control departments, (iv) negative-pressure isolation rooms in emergency departments. The need for ethical approval was waived because the survey did not include clinical or personal data.
V ALID RESPONSES WERE received from 303 hospitals (58.6%).
Of 303 hospitals, 178 (58.7%) had tertiary care emergency centers (treating severe patients), and 125 (41.3%) had general emergency departments (not treating severe patients) ( Table 1 ). The number of physicians with board certification in tertiary care emergency centers and general emergency departments is shown in Table S2 . Only 154 (50.8%) of 303 hospitals had at least one board-certified physician designated by the Japanese Association for Infectious Disease (JAID-certified physicians; Table S3 ).
Of 303 hospitals, 225 (74.3%) had hospital infection control manuals that included content for emergency departments 
T HIS SURVEY WAS the first in Japan to clarify the current situation and issues in infection control in emergency departments. We found that not all JAAM-certified hospitals had manuals or content in manuals regarding infection control in the emergency department.
The importance of infection control in radiology and emergency settings has been previously reported. 7 However, in the current survey, only a few hospitals described disinfection and sterilization of imaging examination rooms for emergency patients in their manuals. The guidelines of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology mention the risks for communicable diseases in the EMS setting. 8 However, only a few hospitals in our survey had manuals with criteria for contacting the EMS. To prevent secondary infection among personnel and other patients, a system for sharing information about potentially infectious patients is necessary.
In this survey, few hospitals prepared specific manuals for the Ebola virus disease, despite the risk that residents or travelers from West Africa could transmit the virus to other countries. 9 As 86% of the hospitals with more than three JAID-certified physicians prepared the manuals, a system to prepare manuals for emerging infectious disease outbreaks is necessary for hospitals even without JAID-certified physicians.
The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine established the Emergency Department Design Guidelines, 10 which mention that ""isolation rooms are needed for potentially infectious patients in emergency departments,"" ""each emergency department should ideally have at least one isolation room,"" and ""respiratory isolation rooms for patients who require airborne droplet nuclei isolation should have negative ventilation."" However, this survey found that 30% of hospitals did not have any negative-pressure isolation rooms, and 15% of hospitals did not have isolation rooms in emergency departments. It is costly to build new isolation rooms in existing hospitals. However, this does not excuse the need for guidelines on having isolation rooms in newly built or rebuilt emergency departments. As physicians, nurses, and other staff are often busy in treating many patients in the emergency department, infection control should also be undertaken simultaneously, especially with severe patients needing resuscitation, emergency, or urgent care. 10 Successful infection control in the emergency department thus requires various specialists, including emergency physicians and nurses, an infection control team, and the cooperation of administrative staff. These requirements make it difficult for hospitals to carry out strict infection control. Our findings suggest that JAID-certified physicians play an important role in controlling infectious diseases. The JAID-certified physicians mostly contributed in preparing manuals regarding image examination rooms and the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014. However, there is a limited number of JAID-certified physicians in Japan. 11, 12 Therefore, to cover all essential content in manuals, which include transmission-based precautions, disinfection and sterilization of imaging examination rooms, contacting the EMS, specific manuals for emerging infectious disease, and isolation rooms, a system that allows knowledge-sharing between hospitals and JAID-certified physicians is needed. Moreover, although guidelines are desirable, there is no sufficient evidence regarding infection control in the emergency department; 6,13 thus, a checklist of essential content for infection control manuals in emergency departments could be helpful.
This survey did not investigate several other elements of infection control, such as screening at admission, isolation of suspected patients, standard precautions, transmissionbased precautions, disinfection and sterilization of medical instruments, disinfection of medical devices and patient rooms, surveillance culture, environmental controls, control for multidrug-resistant organisms, or vaccination of healthcare providers and all staff in the hospital. [14] [15] [16] [17] In addition, the results do not reflect the situation of all JAAM-certified hospitals in Japan (valid responses, 60%).
in emergency departments were not sufficiently met in the hospitals studied. Such elements are required to prevent secondary infection among health-care providers and staff, EMS personnel, and other patients.

18,f74a10293a7a838fc90185edecb37771cf6cd037,"Objective-This study aims to discuss the correlation between daily reported H7N9 cases and stock price indices in China.
February 19, 2013 and March 31, 2014 were collected. A distributed lag non-linear model was used to describe the variation trend for the stock indices","New or reemerging infectious diseases with the potential to cause severe epidemics or pandemics are increasingly prevalent [1, 2] . The emergence of new infectious diseases are not only a threaten to human health, but also cause large economic loss [3] . For example, according to Kumar, Fan and Melzer-Lange, in East and Southeast Asia under two SARS outbreaks, losses amounted to between US$12.3billion and US$28.4 billion [4] . The novel avian influenza A (H7N9), a new emergency infectious disease with a high fatality rate in humans [5] and initially reported in China in March, 2013 has had large economic impacts of H7N9 including over $6.5 billion lost in the agriculture sector due to changes in prices, consumer confidence and trade volumes [6] . The stock market is sensitive to economic indicators and is widely used as a proxy for economic performance [7] . Thus, huge economic losses attributed to H7N9 could be expected to be spontaneously reflected in stock markets in effects.
Of course, stock markets react to a myriad of risk factors including through policy changes and news reports. For example, Merve Alanyali, et al. found a positive correlation between the daily number of mentions of a company in the Financial Times and the same day transaction volume of that company's stock [8] . Moreover, Tobias Preis, et al. evaluated a quantification relationship between changes in Google query volumes for search terms related to finance and changes in stock market prices [9] . When news f disasters breaks, economists report sharp stock price declines especially when the perceived repercussions are large such as immediately after the 9/11 events and their effect on U.S. markets and the Fukushima nuclear leak on markets in Japan. However, to our knowledge, there is no research attempting to discuss the correlation between stock market prices and potential disasters stemming from emerging infectious diseases. This paper attempts to go some way in correcting this gap by detecting whether H7N9 outbreaks in China affected stock markets in China.
The Chinese stock market is a new booming market with more individual customers but fewer institutional or professional investors compared to western contemporaries [10] . Hence, the behavior of the Chinese stock market is more likely to be reflective of individual decision making and thought processes. If we assume that any individual investor makes investment decisions based on their mood in a certain extent, and this mood is affected by events like infectious disease outbreaks, then we can assume that the Chinese stock market, given that investors are new and inexperienced with unrealistic expectations about stock market investments [11] , is likely to be more heavily impacted by changes in the mood because of the news. Thus, we can expect that news of an outbreak of a novel infectious disease like H7N9, together with overly negative emphasis through government warnings or sensationalist news reporting will encourage people to form a negative belief before it can be testified, according to the psychology study. Our hypothesis is that following this initial negative stage, the market will then trend downwards according to the ""Model of Herd Behavior"" before recovering to the normal price according to the ""return to the central "" theory [12] , as people gain better information and normalize their opinion on the true effect of the outbreak.
A confirmed case of human avian influenza A (H7N9) is defined as a patient with both an influenza-like illness and with a positive H7N9 laboratory confirmation. The release date of confirmed cases of human avian influenza A(H7N9) was collected from the websites for each province's population and family planning commission. Stock market index information was collected using Tong-Hua-Shun, an online stock trading analysis software offering overall market and sector index information. We collected opening and closing price information for the Overall Market Index and related sector indices, including the Avian Influenza Sector Index, Chinese Traditional Medicine Sector Index, Biological Product Sector Index, Biomedicine Sector Index. Missing data were removed when we analyzing sector indices. The study was conducted between February 19, 2013 and March 31, 2014.
ANOVA was utilized to investigate the overall effect between cross-basis transformed daily reported cases of human avian influenza A(H7N9) and the opening and closing prices of the four sector indices and Overall Market Index. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) [13, 14] was utilized to describe the variation trend of the stock index along with the daily reported number of confirmed H7N9 cases, and the lag effect of the reported number of confirmed H7N9 case on the stock index.
The DLNM model for the analysis could be specified as:
Following the standard pre-processing of stock price, the daily Overall Market Index and other section indices are denoted as y i in log notation. α is the intercept. ns(t; β t ) is the natural cubic spline of time with respects to the regression coefficient β x . Degrees of freedom (df) per year is set to six to describe long-time trends like seasonal effects. Indicators for day of week (DOW) and public holidays (PH) are adjusted as potential confounders in the model. For the analysis on section indices, the effect of the Overall Market Index was adjusted as COV in the model. These choices are motivated by several methodological and substantive papers on time-series analyses [13] .
cb(x i ; β x ) is the ""cross-basis"" function of x i with the regression coefficient of β x and is used to model the effect of the daily reported case number in the space of reported number and lags. Within each space, natural cubic spline is used to get a flexible fit. Then, in order to get a better fit in the range of the reported number, the knots were placed at equally spaced percentile of the asymptotically Poisson distributed values of reported number. For the dimension of the lags, suggested by previous studies, we put the knots at equal intervals in the logarithmic scale of lags to allow more flexibility in the first part of the distributed lag curve, where more variability is expected [13] . The maximum lag L was set to 2 days.
Several similar models with different knots places, variable df and other parameter settings have been fitted for comparison. The result of the Akaike information criteria (AIC) analysis supports our current selection and parameter settings of the proposed model.
The analysis of the variation trend for each stock index with daily reported case number is presented as four figures: figure (a) presents the effect of daily reported number of H7N9 cases on the log-transformed opening price of the Avian Influenza Sector Index(3D); figure (b) presents the same information as figure (a) but transformed into planar form; and figures (c) and (d) present the effects on closing prices. From figure 3D, we could observe the lagged effects on stock indices for one and two days after the reporting of confirmed H7N9 case numbers. In planar form, we observe the variation trend for the various stock indices along with daily reported number of confirmed H7N9 cases. Here, above the X axis denotes an increasing log stock price, while below the X axis denotes a decreasing log stock price. The absolute value of the distance from the X axis represents speed of change.
During the period studied, there were 367 cases of human avian influenza A (H7N9) reported over 98 days. In the stock index dataset, there were 237 transaction days. Where cases did not overlap with a transaction day, those cases were matched to the nearest following day. Figure 1 gives a general description of the data about the trend of the Overall Market Index and the daily reported number of H7N9 cases.
The daily reported number of H7N9 cases was significantly associated with the closing price of the Avian Influenza Sector Index (ANOVA F-test p-value 2.36×10 −4 ), while there was no statistically significant association with the opening price (ANOVA F-test p-value 8.47×10 −2 ).
The predicted effect of the daily reported number of H7N9 cases on the log-transformed closing price is shown in Figures 2 (c) and 2 (d). Form Figure 2 (d), we roughly observe that the Avian Influenza Sector Index decreased with increasing daily reporting of H7N9 cases whenever daily reported cases were ≤ 4, but with a decreasing decline as the number of reported cases rose towards four. When the daily number of reported cases was greater than four but less than 34, the index rose in line with increasing daily reported case number, first very quickly but slowing as the number of reported cases continued to rise.
From Figure 2 (c), we roughly observe that, when the daily reported number of H7N9 cases was greater than ten and less than 40, the Avian Influenza Sector Index increased although on a decreasing scale whenever the lag time of the reported number was within one day. Outside of a lag time of one day however, the sector index continued to increase at an increasing rate.

The daily reported number of H7N9 cases was significantly associated with the opening and closing price of the Chinese Traditional Medicine Sector Index (ANOVA F-test p-value < 2×10 −15 for both). The predicted effect of the daily reported number of H7N9 cases on the log-transformed opening and closing price is shown in Figures 3(a), 3 
Here, we roughly observe that the Chinese Traditional Medicine Sector Index decreased with increasing rates of daily reported case numbers whenever they were less than forty, with a decreasing decline as the number of reported cases rose to four.
The daily reported number of H7N9 cases was significantly associated with the opening and closing price of the Biological Product Sector Index (ANOVA F-test p-value < 2×10 −16 and < 2×10 −16 ).The predicted effect of the daily reported case number on the log-transformed opening and closing price is shown in Figures 4(a) , 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d). For Figures 4(b) and 4(d), we roughly observe that the Biological Product Sector Index decreased with increasing daily reported cases whenever they were less than thirty, with a decreasing decline as the number of reported cases rose to four.
The daily reported number of H7N9 cases was significantly associated with the opening and closing price of the Biomedicine Sector Index (ANOVA F-test p-value 6.75×10 −16 and < 2×10 −16 ). The predicted effect of daily reported cases on the log-transformed opening and closing price is shown in Figures 5(a) , 5(b), 5(c) and 5(d). For Figure 5 (b) and 5(d), we roughly observe that the Biomedicine Sector Index decreased with the increasing number of daily reported cases whenever they were less than forty, but with a decreasing decline as the number of reported cases rose to four.
The daily reported number of H7N9 cases was significantly associated with the opening price of the Shanghai Composite Index (ANOVA F-test p-value 0.029), but not significantly correlated with the closing price (ANOVA F-test p-value 0.134). The predicted effect of the daily reported number of cases on the log-transformed closing price is shown in Figures 6(a) and 6(b).
The effects along delayed lag at the daily reported number are shown in Figure 7 . A weak lag effect of reported number H7N9 cases on the stock index was also clearly observed.
Our results show that the Avian Influenza Sector Index decreased with increasing counts of H7N9 numbers wherever they were less five. The daily reported number of H7N9 cases was also significantly associated with the closing price of the Avian Influenza Sector Index. Moreover, the trend of the predicted effect on this sector index was contrary to the Overall Market Index (Shanghai Composite Index). One plausible explanation is that the emergency measurements taken by local governments to deal with H7N9 together with encouragement by the Chinese central government to shut down local poultry markets and slaughter existing poultry after local H7N9 reporting [15, 16] , meant that a majority of people were less likely to consume poultry products due to a perceived threat of infection. There was also a corresponding hit on poultry breeding and slaughtering enterprises, most of which are large listed companies with large market shares. However, shutting down poultry markets is not a standard control measure in fighting a H7N9 outbreak and because of this, not all local governments have adapted closing markets as a standard response measure. As such, there was variation in responsiveness and speed at which different governments responded at the market level.
Another plausible explanation in explaining the effect of H7N9 reporting on share market indices is due to the actual market participants in the Chinese stock markets. Compared with the United States where investors usually hire financial advisers to manage their investments and attain feedback on stock performance [10] , the Chinese stock market is far less mature and includes large numbers of individual investors who lack professional information and guidance and are quite often easily influenced by mass media reporting. Indeed, after experiencing the SARS outbreak in China, a majority of Chinese people fear H7N9 especially given the perception that it is a new emergency infectious disease with a high human fatal rate [5] , and with the potential to cause a severe epidemic or pandemic. Given mass media reporting that often indicates that humans infected by H7N9 virus from poultry are often in mortal danger, shareholders tend to selling off related stock without rational thinking.
Figure 2(d) shows that the Avian Influenza Sector Index decreased with increasing daily rates of reported cases whenever the daily reported case number was less than or equal to four. However, whenever the daily number of reported cases was between five and 33, the index rose as the reported case numbers also rise. In this regards, behavioral economic studies have indicated that negative sentiment driven by pessimism and anxiety affects investment decisions which may also affect asset pricing [17, 18] . Given H7N9 outbreaks generate pessimism and anxiety, H7N9 would also affect investment decisions and hence asset prices. This is then amplified by so called herd behavior which can explain the rapid fall of stock prices at the initial stage of H7N9 reporting [19, 20] . On top of that, the ""return to the central"" theory [12] can also be used to explain that in latter stages of the outbreak, prices slowly return to the normal as people reevaluate the potential damage downward and begin to push asset prices back up.
In disaster economics, there is a ""damage created demand"" theory known as the Broken Windows fallacy [21] . Using this theory are a basis for our conclusions, we predict that an outbreak of human avian influenza A(H7N9) in China must necessarily lead to increased stock market demand for related industries such as biomedicine, biological products and Chinese traditional medicine. As such, we would also expect that related sector indices would increase because of the demand and due to the overall investment psychology of domestic Chinese investors. However, our results showed that the sector indices for biomedicine, biological products and Chinese traditional medicine actually decreased with the increasing number of daily reported cases. One plausible explanation is that even though H7N9 is still being reported, investors recognize that the outbreak does not have the potential to create an international pandemic that would warrant a significant increase in biomedical expenditure. They are also less likely to be aware of the outbreak or give it much attention because the scale of infection is nowhere near that seen with pdm A (H1N1) in 2009. As such, total change in demand for stocks in these indexes remains small with net effects on prices due to a H7N9 outbreak also expected to be small.
There were only two reporting peaks of H7N9, with the initial peak occurring in the 15th week of 2013 and the second one occurring at the end of January in 2014. As such, the response to news about these outbreaks may not have been uniform across China with investors acting more reasonable than the first time response to the two reporting peaks. Hence, maybe there was some new results by separated the data according the time.

20,b32f99009279a618af74a7990d891b38603c0b71,"tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). A growing number of reports have shown that tRFs are not random degradation products but are functional ncRNAs made of specific tRNA cleavage. They play regulatory roles in several biological contexts such as cancer, innate immunity, stress responses, and neurological disorders. In this review, we summarize the biogenesis and functions of tRFs.","It is now well known that mammalian genomes encode, in addition to protein-coding genes, RNA molecules that have no protein-coding capacity, and thus are referred to as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [1] . Recent high throughput sequencing data suggest that there are about four times as many ncRNA transcripts as there are protein-coding RNA transcripts in human cells. While some ncRNAs, such as ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and those well-studied ones including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are recognized as functional molecules, the majority of ncRNAs and their biological roles in mammals are underappreciated, as evolution would have favored against such gratuitous and wasteful transcription [2] . However, accumulating evidence has exhibited a remarkable degree of their involvement in many biological events including cell proliferation, cellular stress responses, host immune responses and virus replication [3] [4] [5] [6] . Based on their size, ncRNAs are classified into long, medium, and small ones. Those longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) are termed as long (or large) ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and include the majority of nuclear ncRNAs. Those ranging 40−200 nt are medium-sized ncRNAs including many classic ncRNAs such as 5S rRNA, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), etc. ncRNAs shorter than 40 nt are termed small ncRNAs (sncRNAs) that have been extensively studied in the last two decades and will be elaborated in the next section. In this review, we will focus on a recently discovered class of sncRNAs called tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs), as data from several groups including those from us suggested them to be emerging functional molecules.
The functionality of ncRNAs was initially bolstered by the discovery showing that sncRNAs are capable of mediating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing [7] . The most extensively studied among them are miRNAs that regulate target mRNAs post-transcriptionally in animals and plants [8] [9] [10] . Another class of sncRNAs is siRNAs that are closely related to miRNAs [11] . Although naturally occurring siRNAs have been reported to be present in some mammals in addition to plants and flies [12, 13] , siRNAs are more renowned as an experimental tool in mammalian cells. The gene silencing by synthetic doublestranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and their Dicer-cleavage products (that are siRNAs) is called RNA interference (RNAi) and has been being used as a popular gene knockdown method [3] . This technical breakthrough was well recognized and celebrated by the 2006 Nobel Prize, which was awarded to the two scientists who discovered RNAi [14, 15] . A number of other sncRNAs have also been identified in various organisms [16, 17] , including piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), repeat-associated siRNA (rasiRNA), tiny ncRNAs (tncRNA), heterochromatic small RNA (21U-RNA, hcRNA), scan RNA (scnRNA), transcription initiation RNA (tiRNA) [18] , and promoter/termini-associated sRNA (PASR/TASR) [19] . Although some of these have been shown to play roles in several biological processes such as heterochromatin formation and transposon silencing, their functions are largely unknown and detailed description of them is beyond the scope of this review [10] .
Mature tRNAs are characterized by their evolutionarily conserved secondary and tertiary structures, extensive post-transcriptional modifications (up to 100 nucleoside modifications have been described), extreme stability and resistance to nucleases [20] [21] [22] . There are more than 600 tRNA genes in humans, which are far more than needed for at most 64 anticodons and 20 amino acids [23] [24] [25] , suggesting gene-specific functions of tRNAs other than its traditional function in linking a codon to the cognate amino acid during translation. Indeed, tRFs were recently identified as a new class of sncRNAs fragmentized from tRNAs and shown to be important in regulating cell proliferation, stress-induced translational suppression, stress granule (SG) assembly, and virus replication. Expression of some tRFs is commonly seen among different organisms, further supporting that tRFs have emerged as important players in diverse aspects of biology.
A mature tRNA has a 5ˊ-monophosphate group and 3ˊ-CCA charged with cognate amino acid. All properly folded tRNAs, with so called a cloverleaf structure, have four base-paired stems (in 5ˊ-3ˊ direction: D arm, anticodon arm, T arm, and acceptor stem) bridging the conserved D-loop, tRNA-specific anticodon loop, variable loop, and T-loop. Primary transcripts (pre-tRNAs) undergo several stages of maturation before becoming translation-competent tRNAs [26] . Compared to a mature tRNA, a pre-tRNA lacks a CCA tail but includes a 5ˊ-leader starting with triphosphate, a 3ˊ-trailer with an oligouridine stretch and, for intron-containing tRNA, a variably-sized intron. The 5ˊ-and 3ˊ-end of a pre-tRNA are trimmed by the endonucleases RNase P and RNase Z respectively, and an intron is spliced if there is [27, 28] . The 'CCA' acceptor stem must be added to the 3ˊend as this is not encoded in eukaryotes [29] . While mature, uncleaved tRNAs have a well-defined role in protein translation, multiple groups have cloned and sequenced shorter tRNA fragments [30] . These fragments (termed ""tRFs"") identified so far can be classified into three groups; tRF-5 series whose 5ˊ-end is aligned to the 5ˊ-end of mature tRNA, tRF-3 series whose 3ˊ-end is aligned to the 3ˊ-end of mature tRNA, and tRF-1 series which is the 3ˊ-trailer sequence in a pre-tRNA and released during 3ˊ-end processing (Fig. 1) . Some groups have also termed the tRF-5 or tRF-3 series as tRF halves or type I [31, 32] and tRF1 series as type II [32] .
The tRF-5 series were the first identified class of tRFs and were usually formed by a cleavage in the D or anticodon loop of a mature tRNA. They have been reported in mammalian cells, plants, and fission yeast [3, [33] [34] [35] [36] . As aforementioned, the tRF-3 series are those derived from the 3ˊ-end of a mature tRNA, usually by cleavage in the T loop [3, 32, [37] [38] [39] . As the 3ˊ-end of mature tRNAs is the acceptor trinucleotide CCA, the tRF-3 series also characteristically has an end CCA. The tRF-1 series are undoubtedly the RNase Z cleavage product of a pre-tRNA, because their 5ˊends begin immediately after the 3ˊ-terminus of the mature tRNA and their 3ˊ-ends are a series of U residues that are residual from RNA polymerase III transcription run-off [3, 32, 40, 41] . Overall, the cleavage of tRFs is very much structure-dependent, suggesting they are not randomly degraded products.
Other reasons supporting that tRFs are biologically meaningful include their endonuclease-specific cleavage [3, 4, 34, 42] . The production of the tRF-5 series has been reported to be Dicer or angiogenin (ANG)-dependent in mammals [33, 34] . In one case, the tRF-5 series were identified to be produced after the hybridization of the 3ˊ-end of the human cellular tRNA lys with the HIV-1 primer binding site, raising the possibility that, at least in certain cases, tRFs may be produced when a tRNA base-pairs with another RNA molecule [38] . It has been reported that the tRF-3 series are generated by Dicer [32, 38] . In Tetrahymena, although the nuclease identity was not proven, the tRF-3 series have 5ˊmonophosphates that are usually left after Dicer cleavage and are in physical association with Argonaute/Piwi proteins, suggesting Dicer-mediated cleavage [39] . The tRNA 3ˊ-trailer sequences are thought to be rapidly degraded in the nuclear compartment soon after being cleaved from pre-tRNAs. Therefore, it is quite surprising that the tRF-1 series are localized mainly in the cytoplasm [3, 41] . There are two explanations on how the tRF-1 series bypass nuclear cleavage: (1) the tRF-1 series are exported from the nucleus by an unknown mechanism upon processing, or (2) pre-tRNAs escape nuclear quality control and are processed by cytoplasmic RNase Z. Biological evidence indeed supports the second possibility. At least in one case of a tRF-1 molecule derived from tRNA Ser (termed tRF-1001 [3] and Cand45 [32] ), the corresponding pre-tRNA is localized in the cytoplasm [3, 32] . Also there are several reports supporting the cytoplasmic localization of tRNA endonucleases responsible for the tRF-1 series [3, 43] .
Are tRFs merely by-products of tRNA degradation or nuclease off-target effects? Or do they have bona fide biological functions? If they do have functions, how diverse are these functions? Several lines of evidence have identified their regulatory targets, supporting that they are functional molecules [31, 34, 35, 37] . Although the exact roles of tRFs are further to be elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that they participate in two main types of biological processes as discussed in more detail below (Fig. 2 ).
tRNAs are indispensable components of the translational machinery, hence one can surmise that tRNA cleavage affects protein synthesis. However, the mode of translational regulation by tRNA cleavage is not simply a result of change in the mature tRNA pool available for protein synthesis. Ivanov et al. showed that tRNA halves generated by ANG during stress play an active role in inhibiting protein synthesis and triggering the phospho-eIF2α-independent assembly of SGs [44] .
In addition to tRNA halves, tRFs have also been reported to be involved in global translational inhibition in human cells. In the archaeon Haloferax volcanii a 26-nt long tRF-5 originating from tRNA Val in a stress-dependent manner was shown to directly bind to the small ribosomal subunit and reduce protein synthesis by interfering with peptidyl transferase activity [45] . A similar mechanism of translation inhibition by a tRF-5 was also observed in human cells [46] . A 19-nt long tRF-5 derived from tRNA Gln decreased the expression of a reporter gene that did not have a sequence complementary to that of the tRF-5, suggesting that nonspecific translational repression is mediated by this tRF-5. An interesting observation from this study was that the tRFs required a conserved ""GG"" dinucleotide for their activity in inhibiting translation. Because the tRF-5 series were detected in the polysome fraction, interaction of the tRF-5 with the ribosome may contribute to translation [46] .
In addition to above-mentioned translational regulation, it has become apparent that some tRFs mediate gene silencing similarly to miRNAs by binding to Argonaute family proteins [16, 17, 47] . The first tRFs suggested to be involved in the gene silencing are some tRF-5 and -3 molecules [32] . Haussecker et al. observed that they are in association with Ago-3 and -4 and exhibit trans-gene silencing activity. However, this activity is much lower than that of miRNAs. On the other hand, some groups showed that the tRF-5 series have inefficient association with Argonautes [34] and do not exhibit detectable silencing effects [31] .
Probably the most convincing result is from our recent studies on a tRF-5 molecule derived from mature tRNA GluCTC (tRF5-GluCTC). Upon infection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), tRF5-GluCTC is induced robustly and plays a gene-silencing role on a target mRNA with a reverse complementary target sequence. In this case, the transsilencing mechanism used by this tRF was distinct from that of canonical miRNA/siRNA. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the 3ˊ-portion of tRF5-GluCTC is critical for its gene silencing function, in contrast to miRNAs whose 5portion is the key determinant in target recognition [5] .
The expression of tRFs is altered in a number of pathological conditions and so those tRFs could be useful disease biomarkers. The involvement of tRFs in cancer, neurodegeneration and infectious disease will be discussed in the following paragraphs (Fig. 2) [5, 48] .
The role of tRFs in cancer was first reported by Lee et al 3 .
One of the tRF-1 series (namely tRF-1001), derived from pre-tRNA Ser , is highly expressed in several cancer cell lines relative to non-proliferating normal tissues, and is required for proliferation of prostate cancer cells [3] . The levels of tRF-1001 in cancer cells are directly related to the degree of cellular proliferation. Knocking down this tRF causes a dramatic loss of cell viability and inhibition of cell proliferation with specific accumulation of cells in G2 phase and inhibition of DNA synthesis [3] . In addition, analysis of the small RNA transcriptome in prostate cancer revealed enrichment of tRFs in both non-metastatic and metastatic lymph node prostate cancer samples [3] . The molecular mechanism by which tRF-1001 affects cell physiology is not known. There may be a differential processing of tRNA in prostate cancer because tRFs in non-metastatic samples were 18 nucleotides long whereas tRFs in metastatic tissues were 27 nucleotides long [49] .
The important role of tRFs in controlling cancer is also supported by the observation showing enhanced ANG expression in almost all types of cancer [50] [51] [52] . Recently, it has been shown that ANG produced tRFs that re-program Y Fu, et al. tRNA-Derived RNA Fragments translation and promote the assembly of stress granules. As these events help cells survive under adverse conditions, it is possible that ANG-induced tRFs may contribute to ANG-mediated cancer cell proliferation [48] . tRFs have also been reported to help cancer cells to prevent apoptosome formation by binding to cytochrome c [53] .
Although tRNA metabolism is essential for all human cells, a number of neurological disorders are caused by defects in tRNA metabolism and tRNA processing enzymes. ANG mutants possessing reduced RNase activity were implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease [54] . A subset of ALSassociated ANG mutants was also found in Parkinson's disease patients [55] . Administration of recombinant ANG to cultured neurons protects them from stress-induced apoptosis and promotes the lifespan and motor function of SOD1 (G93A) mice, a laboratory ALS model.
In neurons, excessive accumulation of some tRF-5 series members that are derived from a specific subset of tRNAs (Asp, Glu, Gly, His, Val, and Lys) triggers a sustained stress response leading to neuronal loss and links aberrant tRNA metabolism to the development of certain forms of intellectual disability [48] .
tRFs derived from intron-containing tRNAs are also strongly implicated in neurodegeneration [56] [57] [58] . A study on mutant mice carrying a catalytically inactive form of the RNA kinase CLP1, a component of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, revealed a neurological disorder characterized by progressive loss of lower spinal motor neurons. Surprisingly, mutant mice accumulate a novel class of tRFs. In addition, homozygous missense mutations in CLP1 (R140H) were found in patients with pontocerebellar hypoplasia, a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by impaired development of various parts of the brain. These patients were identified to suffer from severe motor-sensory defects, cortical dysgenesis and microcephaly, and exhibit alterations in tRNA splicing [59] . On the cellular level, the R140A mutation leads to the depletion of mature tRNAs, the accumulation of unspliced pre-tRNAs in patient-derived induced neurons [58] and the accumulation of linear tRNA introns [57] . Transfection of 5ˊ-unphosphorylated tRF corresponding to the 3ˊ-exon of pre-tRNA Tyr (the natural substrate of CLP1) into patient cells results in reduced neuron survival under oxidative stress compared to the transfection of the 5ˊ-exon, which had no effect on viability [58] . The kinase-dead CLP1 mice accumulate 5ˊ-leader-exon-tRFs that sensitize cells to oxidative stress and promote cell death in a p53-dependent fashion [56] . While the exact mechanistic details on the interplay between CLP1 activity, tRNA splicing and functions of pre-tRNA-derived tRFs are yet to be uncovered, these studies provide a basis for further investigations linking aberrant tRNA metabolism and development of neurodegeneration [48] .
Viruses exploit a number of strategies to evade host immune recognition and to facilitate viral replication. Some of these strategies involve viral-derived or endogenous cellular ncRNAs that interact with host immune responses [60] .
We have demonstrated that RSV, the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies, employs a novel mechanism to suppress antiviral responses via induction of some tRFs [5, 61] . We have shown that RSV infection in airway epithelial cells leads to the activation of endonuclease ANG, subsequently inducing abundant production of tRFs, most of which belong to that tRF-5 series. The cleavage sites by ANG are preferentially adjacent to the 5ˊ-end of the anticodon-loop, generating tRF-5 series. These tRF-5s are localized exclusively in the cellular cytoplasm [5] . At least one of the tRFs, namely tRF5-GluCTC (tRF-5 derived from tRNA Glu ), has a trans-gene silencing function. Significantly, an antiviral target suppressed by tRF5-GluCTC downregulates RSV replication and significantly decreases the yield of infectious viral particles produced by infected cells, demonstrating a stimulatory role for tRF5-GluCTC in RSV replication [5] .
Using an elegant biochemical approach, named HITS-ABt (hIgh-throughput sequencing of RNAs associated with biotinylated tRF), to capture tRF5-GluCTC-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes combined with bioinformatics analysis, we have identified a number of potential cellular mRNA targets of tRF5-GluCTC. One of the candidate mRNAs was shown to be a direct target of tRF5-GluCTC. Mechanistically, tRF5-GluCTC recognizes a target site in the 3ˊ-untranslated region of APOER2 mRNA and suppresses its expression by an unknown mechanism. Further analysis identified a previously unappreciated role for APOER2 protein in antiviral defense against RSV infection [61] . Thus, we have illuminated the roles of tRFs in host-virus interactions and described a novel molecular mechanism for host response regulation via gene targeting at posttranscriptional level, proving a potential therapeutic target to control RSV replication by regulating tRFs induction. As another example of tRFs with a positive effect on viral replication, a tRF-3 derived from tRNA Pro (tRF-3019) has been suggested to function as a primer for reverse transcrip-tion of human T-cell leukemia virus-1 [62] .
The induction of tRFs is virus specific, as human metapneumovirus, a negative-sense single stranded RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family [63] and frequent cause for lower respiratory tract infections in young children, immunocompromised patients and older adults [64] [65] [66] [67] , did not induce tRFs but gradually enhanced the expression percentage of miRNAs in a time-dependent fashion [6] . The involvement of tRFs in infectious diseases suggests that tRFs may be targets for the development of new drugs to control viral replication.
The human genome encodes hundreds of tRNA genes and pseudogenes. In the past two decades, an increasing number of reports have revealed abundant expression of functional tRFs; thus, it now appears highly plausible that cells use tRNAs as a source for functional sncRNAs to modulate biological processes beyond its translation function. It is imperative to discriminate functional tRNA fragments from ""meaningless"" degradation products, and to biochemically elucidate the factors in their biogenesis as well as to determine their molecular functions. Although tRFs, at least the tRF-5s induced by RSV, regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional stages in the cytoplasm, the precise mechanism is yet to be clarified. Like miRNAs, tRFs can repress target mRNAs by inhibiting their translation or facilitating their decay. These questions can be answered by analyzing their localization, identifying their interacting protein partners besides Argonaute proteins, and examining various biological phenomena in response to the changes in the expression of tRFs. Bioinformatics studies with the support from biochemical assays have identified numerous novel tRNA-interacting proteins [68] , implying that the biological functions of tRNAs and their fragments may be way beyond our expectations. Further combination of computational and biochemical efforts will significantly advance our understanding of functional tRFs and expand our knowledge regarding the tRNA world.
The availability of genome sequencing data from patients with diverse conditions has already led to the identification of several mutations in tRNA genes and in genes involved in tRNA biogenesis [69] . The task now is to ascertain whether these mutations indeed affect the repertoire of tRFs and consequently the molecular pathology of the diseases. Studies on tRFs are still at a very early stage. Additional functions for tRFs are likely to be discovered continuously. Improved understanding of the functions of tRFs will provide valuable insights into human physiology and pathophysiology.
Recognition of tRFs as an important class of functional molecules has not happened until recently. The apparent presence of abundant tRFs in early studies with next generation sequencing data was often ignored. However, the combined biochemical evidence from many years of tRNA biology studies has brought the field to a previously unexpected conceptual consensus: specific tRFs are not simply random degradation products but functional molecules based on the following observations: (1) in many cases, tRFs do not derive from abundant cellular tRNAs, and the numbers of tRFs do not correlate with the parental tRNA gene copy numbers; (2) their fragmentation patterns are tRNA structure-dependent; (3) the fragmentation patterns is determined by the developmental stage or cell conditions; and (4) it is reported that some tRFs are bound to Argonaute/Piwi proteins, well-known components of the RNA-induced silencing complex [21, 31, [70] [71] [72] [73] . The expression of tRFs does not usually affect mature tRNA pools. Instead, it is involved in normal biological processes beyond translation and in diseases; thus, studies of tRFs have provided new insights into tRNA biology.","Small Non-coding Transfer RNA-Derived RNA Fragments (tRFs): Their Biogenesis, Function and Implication in Human Diseases","Fu, Yu; Lee, Inhan; Lee, Yong Sun; Bao, Xiaoyong",Genomics Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4742329/,64,3428,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,7307753da247144e66cc91b8f48c33e5a9ceff2b,"Live attenuated vaccines are critical in the control of avian infectious bronchitis. It is necessary to know the protection conferred by commonly used commercial live vaccines. In this study, specific pathogen-free chicks were vaccinated with the commercial live vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A. Blood samples were collected at weekly intervals for the detection of IBV-specific antibodies and quantification of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes. At 21 days post-inoculation the vaccinated birds were challenged with the IBV prevalent local strains GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032, respectively. Trachea and kidney samples were collected at 5 days post-challenge for the detection of the virus. The results showed that the H120 group exhibited medium antibody levels, the lowest percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the highest viral loads. The 4/91 group showed the lowest antibody levels, but the highest percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the lowest viral loads. The LDT3-A group showed the highest antibody levels, the medium percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the medium viral loads. The protection rates of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A groups were 41.7-58.3%, 75.0-83.7% and 66.7-75.0%, respectively. The present study demonstrated that the vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A could stimulate the immunized chicks to produce different levels of humoral and cellular immunity to resist the infection of IBV, but couldn't provide complete protection against the prevalent local strains of IBV in southern China. Also, the vaccine 4/91 offered the best immune protection among the three vaccines.
Avian infectious bronchitis (IB), an acute, highly contagious disease, is caused by avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which results in severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. An increasing number of new serotypes or variants of IBV, which were caused by gene mutation and recombination, have been identified [4, 9, 16, 17, 19] . Vaccination is the main measure for the prevention and control of IB, but since there are multiple IBV serotypes and different serotypes of IBVs, vaccinations result in incomplete or no cross-protection against the various types of IBV. Hence, it is important to choose suitable vaccines for the control of IBV in the field.
Live, attenuated and inactivated vaccines are commonly used to control IB at the present time. However, the effects of inactivated vaccines are uncertain and inactivated vaccines often fail to induce strong cellular immunity [23] . Although the live, attenuated vaccines can cause virus mutation and recombination, they can induce effective humoral and cellular immune responses as well as local immunity [3, 21] . In young birds, live, attenuated vaccines are especially used to achieve early protection and also to prime future layers and breeders, which will be boosted with the inactivated vaccines later [21] . Therefore, the live, attenuated vaccines are of importance in the prevention and control of IB in the field.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms. which has been issued by the official authority in China since 2011. In spite of extensive vaccination with these three vaccines in chickens in China, the disease is still epidemic in vaccinated flocks [6, [25] [26] [27] . In addition, IBV strains prevalent in a specific geographic region are distinct and unique, although some have a more general distribution [1, 2] . Hence, it is extremely critical to know whether these live, attenuated vaccines confer protection against the prevalent local strains of IBV in particular regions or countries and whether the birds respond promptly to vaccination.
Southern China is the major poultry production region in China, especially for yellow chickens. Despite the widespread application of multiple vaccines in chickens, IB continues to be a major problem [6, 11, 17] . Our previous studies and those from other groups showed that there were multiple genotypes and serotypes of IBV isolates in southern China; most IBV isolates occurred from mutations and dominant epidemic strains which have existed in recent years [6, 11, 12, 17, 18, 20] . In China, a few previous studies reported the protection conferred by attenuated vaccines [13, 14, 24] . However, little information is available about the protection conferred by the vaccines of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A against IBV prevalent local strains in southern China.
No previous study has focused on the comparison of protection conferred by these three live attenuated vaccines. In the present study, three Guangxi IBV isolates, belonging to the three dominant serotypes in southern China, were selected to evaluate the protection conferred by the vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A. This data will provide a useful reference for choosing suitable vaccines and developing new vaccines to prevent and control IB in China.
Three live, attenuated vaccines, H120 (Guangdong Dahuanong Animal Health Products Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China), 4/91 (MSD Animal Health (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and LDT3-A (QYH Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) were purchased commercially. Each vaccine was reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions. According to our previous description [12, 20] , H120 (Massachusetts serotype) and 4/91 (793B serotype) vaccines were designated as serotype 3 and serotype 5, respectively. The serotype of LDT3-A vaccine was different from Mass-type vaccines and other vaccines used in China [13] . IBV local isolates GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032 belonging to serotype 1, 2 and 5, respectively, were isolated from Guangxi, China and were currently the representative dominant serotypes in southern China [10, 18] . GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032 strains were propagated in 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken embryos and the 50% tracheal organ culture infection dose (TOC-ID 50 ) was determined as previously described for the quantification of the viruses [12] .
The SPF white leghorn chickens used in this study were hatched in our facilities (Guangxi University, Nanning, China) from fertile SPF eggs (Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The birds were reared in separate isolators following animal welfare guidelines and under strict biosecurity measures. Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care & Welfare Committee of Guangxi University (approval number GXU2016-011) and were performed in accordance with animal ethics guidelines and approved protocols.
Seven-day-old SPF birds were randomly divided into five groups, which were named as H120 group, 4/91 group, LDT3-A group, non-vaccinated group and blank control group, respectively. There were 12 birds in the blank control group and 36 birds in the other four groups. Birds in the groups of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A were vaccinated by eye and nose drop with H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A attenuated vaccines, respectively, at the manufacturer's recommended dose. Birds in the non-vaccinated group were treated with sterile phosphate-buffered saline in the same manner and those in the blank control group received nothing. Blood samples were collected from 10 birds in each group prior to inoculation (0 day) and at 7, 14 and 21 post-inoculation (dpi) of the vaccines for detection of IBV-specific antibody and quantity analysis of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes. At 21 dpi birds in the H120, 4/91, LDT3-A and non-vaccinated groups were divided randomly into three groups of 12 birds each and challenged via eye and nose drop with 0.2 ml of 10 4 TOC-ID 50 of IBV GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032 strains, respectively. Birds in the blank control group received no challenge virus. Clinical signs were observed and recorded daily. At 5 days post-challenge (dpc), the birds in each group were humanely killed and necropsied. The trachea and kidney samples were collected from each bird aseptically for the detection of viral loads. The dead birds were also necropsied to confirm the infection of IBV.
A portion of the blood samples collected above were used to detect the IBV-specific antibody using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (IDEXX Laboratory, Inc., Westbrook, ME, U.S.A.) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from another portion of the blood samples collected above and then used to analyze the percentages of the CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes by flow cytometry. 1 × 10 6 cells were stained with Mouse Anti-Chicken CD4-PE and CD8a-FITC antibodies (Wuhan AmyJet Scientific Inc., Wuhan, China). All staining reactions were conducted following the manufacturers' protocols. Then the fluorescence positive cells were analyzed by a BD Accuri TM C6 Flow Cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Co., NJ, U.S.A.). doi: 10.1292/jvms.18-0249
Viral RNA was extracted from trachea and kidney samples of each bird at 5 dpc using EasyPure RNA Purification Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan). The IBV viral loads in trachea and kidney samples were detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene according to our previous description [8] .
All data were shown as mean values ± standard error (mean ± SE). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.), and significant differences (P<0.05) were determined by the Student's t-test. P values less than 0.05 (P<0.05) were regarded as significant and those less than 0.01 (P<0.01) were regarded as highly significant.
The birds in all the three vaccinated groups produced antibodies against IBV at 7dpi and the antibody levels continued to rise from 7 to 21 dpi, especially in the LDT3-A group (Fig. 1) . The antibody levels of vaccinated groups were significantly higher (P<0.05 or P<0.01) than those of non-vaccinated groups from 7 to 21 dpi. At 21 dpi, the LDT3-A group showed the highest antibody level (P<0.01), while the H120 group showed a medium level and the 4/91 group presented the lowest level (P<0.05).
The percentages of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes in all the three vaccinated groups showed different upward trends and were significantly higher (P<0.05 or P<0.01) than those of the non-vaccinated groups within 21 dpi (Fig. 2 ). At 7 dpi, the 4/91 and H120 groups showed the highest CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocyte percentages, respectively. At 14 dpi, the H120 and 4/91 groups had the highest (P<0.05) CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocyte percentages, respectively. At 21 dpi, the percentages of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes in the 4/91 group were the highest, and those in the H120 group were the lowest.
At 2-5 dpc, there were birds in the vaccinated groups exhibited gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rale and nasal discharge and some looked depressed with anorexia, ruffled feathers, dry claw and wet droppings. Some even exhibited severe respiratory distress and eventually died. And all the birds in the non-vaccinated group showed much more severe clinical signs than those in the vaccinated groups. In the necropsy at 5 dpc, the kidneys of the birds challenged with GX-YL5 strain were swollen and pale, and showed a white sludge of urate deposition, and some birds showed trachitis with exudates. The birds challenged with GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032 strains exhibited more exudates in the trachea. No clinical signs or gross lesions were observed in any birds in the blank control group. The immune protection rates of each group against the challenge The morbidity, mortality and protective rate of the experiment groups at 5 dpc were summarized in Table 1 . The results showed that the protection rates of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A vaccines against the infection of GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032 strains were 41.7-58.3%, 75.0-83.7% and 66.7-75.0%, respectively. The protection rate of the 4/91 group against the challenge of GX-NN09032 strain was the highest (83.7%). As expected, no protection was observed in the non-vaccinated group. No morbidity and mortality were observed in any birds in the blank control group.
The viral loads in trachea and kidney of vaccinated groups were significantly (P<0.01) lower than those of the non-vaccinated group at 5 dpc (Fig. 3) . In all vaccinated groups, the viral loads in the trachea were higher than those in the kidney. The viral loads in the trachea and kidney of the vaccinated groups at every time points showed the same pattern, that was the H120 group was higher than that of the LDT3-A group and the LDT3-A group was higher than that of the 4/91 group. The viral loads in trachea and kidney of the 4/91 group challenged with the same serotype strain GX-NN09032 maintained a low level of less than 10 2 copies/µl and were significantly lower than those of the H120 group and the LDT3-A group at 5 dpc. None of the viruses was detected in the trachea or kidney samples from the blank control group.
Live attenuated vaccines play a key role in the control of IB, but limited or no cross-protection confers between serotypes of IBVs. Therefore, it is extremely critical to choose the appropriate IBV vaccines in practice. Little is known about the protection conferred by the commonly used live attenuated vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A against IBV prevalent local strains in southern China. In the present study, significantly higher antibody levels and percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes in vaccinated groups compared to the non-vaccinated groups within 21 dpi indicated that the vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A could stimulate the immunized chickens to produce humoral and cellular immunity that potentially resist or eliminate the infection of IBV. However, at 5 dpc, the protection rates of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A vaccines against the challenges of the three prevalent IBV isolates were 41.7-58.3%, 75-83.7% and 66.7-75.0%, respectively. Hence, none of the three attenuated vaccines could provide complete protection against all the current prevalent isolates, but vaccine 4/91 offered the best immune protection of the three and vaccine LDT3-A had better protection than the H120 vaccine.
A previous report showed that the best protection against challenge is achieved by a vaccine containing a homologous strain [7] . In this study, the attenuated vaccine H120 (serotype 3) provided poor protection against IBV GX-YL5 (serotype 1), GX-GL11079 (serotype 2) and GX-NN09032 (serotype 5) strains with the low protection rate of 41.7, 58.3 and 58.3%, respectively. The vaccine 4/91 (serotype 5) has provided lower protection rate against the challenge with GX-GL11079 (serotype 2, 75.0%) compared to GX-NN09032 (serotype 5, 83.7%). Interestingly, the vaccine 4/91 (serotype 5) provided the same protection rate (83.7%) against the challenge with isolate GX-YL5 (serotype 1) and GX-NN09032 (serotype 5), but the viral loads of trachea and kidney from GX-NN09032 challenged birds were always lower than those from GX-YL5 challenged birds. Therefore, our data indicated that the vaccine 4/91 had a greater ability to inhibit the replication and reduce the shedding of a homologous serotype virus than a heterologous serotype virus; the vaccine H120 provided poor protection against the heterologous serotype viruses. These findings support the necessity of developing new vaccines whose antigenicity match the antigenic profile of current prevalent IBV variants in the region.
According to the requirements in China, the clinical protection offered by a compliant IB vaccine must be not less than 80% against a virulent challenge [13] . Previous studies demonstrated that the H120 vaccine couldn't provide sufficient protection against the field isolates in China [6, [13] [14] [15] 24] . The latest report showed that a novel recombinant virulent IBV strain was isolated from an H120-and 4/91-IBV-vaccinated flock in China [27] . In our study, the attenuated vaccine 4/91 could not provide complete protection against IBV GX-NN09032 strain even though they shared the same serotype [20] . The reason for this may be that a single vaccine dose of a monovalent vaccine could not provide sufficient immunity with complete protection to birds. Therefore, in an attempt to provide broader protection to chickens, the prime-boost vaccination program in combination with application of two different IBV vaccines (""live + live"" or ""live + inactivated"") should be performed for the birds in southern China. In other countries, it has also been showed that vaccination with two antigenically distinct live-attenuated vaccines can achieved a broad cross-protection against multiple different IBV types [5, 21, 22] . Further investigation will be necessary to determine which combination of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A vaccines could provide the most effective protection against the prevalent local strains in southern China.
In summary, the present study indicated that the commercial attenuated vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A could not provide complete protection against the prevalent isolates of IBV in southern China. The 4/91 vaccine demonstrated the best immune protection against the IBV strains prevalent in southern China, while LDT3-A vaccine was less protective and H120 vaccine provided the least protection. The results also stressed the necessity of developing new vaccines containing a homologous serotype strain and the prime-boost vaccination schedules in combination with application of two different IBV vaccine strains.

23,4971940ab68e4950b28410a208166900e8ba9c07,"Despite of the role of domestic dogs as reservoirs for threatening viral diseases for wild carnivores, few studies have focused to identify circulation of viruses among dogs living in human/wildlife interfaces. To identify canine parvovirus (CPV) types circulating in dogs living in an Atlantic forest biome, faecal samples (n = 100) were collected at the same period (one week) corresponding to each of four areas, during 2014 to 2016 and corresponded to 100 different individuals. CPV was isolated in cell culture from 67 out 100 (67%) samples from healthy dogs.
Cytopathic effects were characterized by total or partial cell culture lysis. Genome sequences of CPV-2a (10%), CPV-2b (7%) and CPV-2c (50%) were concomitantly detected by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The current study addresses the importance of monitoring CPV circulation among dogs presenting potential contact with wildlife species.","Since its initial identification in the late 1970's, canine parvovirus (CPV) has been evolving, generating new genetic and antigenic variants worldwide. Since its emergence, CPV has remained a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality in young dogs worldwide (Decaro et al., 2009; Decaro et al., 2011; Miranda and Thompson, 2016) . The CPV evolution has given rise to three genetic/ antigenic variants, CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c (Vieira et al., 2008; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012) . Molecular and epidemiological data indicate that the newest type, CPV-2c, is becoming prevalent in several geographic areas and is often associated with severe disease in adult dogs, including those with complete vaccination record (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012) . In Brazil, the CPV-2c variant has already been described, especially in southern Brazil (Costa et al., 2005; Castro et al., 2010; Oliveira et al., 2017) .
The furthermost important diseases transmitted from dogs to wild carnivores, e.g. rabies, canine distemper and parvovirosis, are named "" The Big Three"" due to the strong impact over the health of wild species (Curi et al., 2016) . Thus, infectious diseases driven-mortality is one of the major causes of population decline and, in some situations, even extinction of wild mammal carnivores worldwide (Curi et al., 2016) . Although evidence on the role of domestic dogs as reservoirs of viral diseases for wild carnivores is becoming a global pattern, few such reports are described in South America (Acosta-Jamett et al., 2015; Curi et al., 2016) . In this respect, a pioneer study has recently described the prevalence and risk factors for viral exposure in rural dogs around protected areas of Atlantic forest (Curi et al., 2016) . For this purpose, virus isolation, PCR detection and sequencing analysis of isolated CPV were performed in 100 faecal samples collected from dogs living in a rural area belonging to Atlantic forest biome 2. Material and methods
Faecal samples were collected per rectum from apparently healthy dogs and stored at −86°C prior to virus isolation. The studied region is localized 21°12′32′′S 50°25′58′′W and was divided into 4 different areas (50 Km 2 ). The collection was performed at the same period (one week) corresponding to each area, during 2014 to 2016 and corresponded to 100 different individuals. This study was approved by the ethical committee (CEEA) of Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho"". The study was performed under all applicable institutional guidelines for the care and ethical use of animals were followed as recommended by Animal Brazilian Experimentation Committee protocol number 2015/09754. Approximately 2 g of faeces was homogenized in 1 volume of sterile phosphatebuffered solution (PBS), clarified by centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.75 μm filter (Millipore TM ) and treated with amphotericin and penicillin (concentrated at 100X; Sigma-Aldrich ® , St. Louis, MO, USA). AF-72 cells (ATCC, CRL 1542) were cultured in MEM (Sigma-Aldrich ® ) supplemented with antimycotic/antibiotic 1X solution, 10% foetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich ® ), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich ® ), and non-essential amino acids (100x, Invitrogen ® , Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 with 95% humidity. After AF-72 cells reached 80% confluence, 1 ml of faecal preparation was added to 4.7 × 10 5 cells/ml and the culture supernatant was submitted to three blind passages at 5-day intervals. Inoculated and control cells were monitored under phase-contrast using an Olympus IX-70 microscope for production of cytopathic effect (CPE) (Olympus ® , Tokyo, Japan). Approximately 10 fields were analysed in each condition, and photographs were taken at 200 x magnification by using cell Sens TM software (Olympus ® ). CPV VR-2016 TM (ATCC), Cornell strain, which is present in all Brazilian vaccines, were used as controls. Mock-infected AF-72 cells were used as negative controls nd cells inoculated with CPV VR-2016 TM , strain Cornell were used as positive controls. Other enteric viruses, e.g., canine adenoviruses 1 and 2 (CAV-1, CAV-2) and canine distemper virus (CDV), were not detected in the examined samples by molecular analysis (data not shown).
For detection of the CPV genome, total DNA from infected/uninfected AF-72 cells was extracted using DNAzol TM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen ® ). An average of 100 ng of genomic DNA was used for PCR as described previously. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify a fragment of 583 base pairs (bp) of the VP2 gene, a region surrounding position 426, using primers described previously (Decaro et al., 2009; Mohan Raj et al., 2010) . CPV amplicons were purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II kit and sequenced with an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems TM ) using the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems TM ).
Sequences were aligned using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor V.7.0.9.0 (Tamura et al., 2007) . The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbour-Joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) . The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree (Hall, 1999) . All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 (Tamura et al., 2007) . A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on amino acid alignments using BLAST analysis (www.blast.ncib.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), and sequences generated for CPV were submitted to GenBank and assigned.
The cytopathic effect was characterized by cell rounding and/or partial or total lysis of the monolayers in comparison to control (Fig. 1A , B and C, respectively).
To construct the phylogenetic tree, the sequences of four viruses were included. A fragment of 583 bp corresponding to the VP2CPV gene was amplified in 67 out of 100 (67%) analyzed samples. Nucleotide sequencing confirmed the CPV identity. Forty positive samples (59.7%) belonged to animals that had free access to fragmented forest. Interestingly, 33 out of 67 positive samples (49.2%), were obtained from dogs that have free access to forest, being considered an interface to human-wildlife. The amplified DNA fragments were directly sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that 90.2% of the samples carried the amino acid (aa) Glu at the position 426, characteristic of CPV-2c strains, and 65% of these CPV-2c strains showed the substitution. Despite of the fact that CPV-2c was first described in South America in 2007, the high prevalence of CPV-2c strains in Brazil continues nowadays (Pérez et al., 2007; Streek et al., 2009; Calderón et al., 2015; Fontana et al., 2013; Oliveira et al., 2017) . Out of the 67 positive samples, 10% were identified as CPV-2a (KP694304) and 7% CPV-2b (KP694306) (Fig. 2 ). An additional 50 samples were related to CPV-2c sequences (KP694303 and KP694302). Sequence alignment showed that these sequences presented the amino acid substitution (Asp-426 to Glu-426) that characterizes the 2c type (data not shown). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the use a representative strains which had been characterized as CPV2-c were subjected to full length VP2 amplification and cloning.
Although CVP-2c has been detected in several Brazilian regions, this is the first description of its circulation in rural/wild areas representing human/wildlife interfaces (Costa et al., 2005; Streek et al., 2009; Castro et al., 2010; Fontana et al., 2013; Oliveira et al., 2017) . Despite of the availability and use of several commercial vaccines, viral enteritis − including that associated with CPV infection − remains an important problem for Brazilian dogs (Oliveira et al., 2017) . In addition, our study showed that CPV isolation is feasible when faeces are processed shortly after collection. This procedure allows for enriching viral preparations for several purposes, including biological studies of viral replication, drug susceptibility and virus-host interactions (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012; Parthiban et al., 2011) . In a recent study, rural dogs living in households around six Atlantic forests in southeastern Brazil were serologically tested for CPV antibodies and 97% were positive (Curi et al., 2016) . Our study provides a confirmatory piece of information about the circulation of CPV in rural areas and reinforce the risk of it is usual see wild carnivores circulating in urban areas due to forest fragmentation in protected areas in Brazil (Curi et al., 2016) . In this sense, increased risk of CPV in rural areas in Australia highlighted a need for vigilance in order to prevent virus spread to wild species (Zourkas et al., 2015) . Moreover, in Argentina, a reemergence of CPV-2a in domestic dogs was observed, corroborating the genetic diversity detected worldwide (Calderón et al., 2015) . Accurate genotyping for field CPV strains is important for epidemiological issues. Moreover, evaluation of the serological responses suggests vaccination with CPV-2b would cross-protect against CPV-2a and CPV-2c, as well as against CPV-2 which is now extinct in the field (Wilson et al., 2014) .
The findings described herein provide relevant information on the potential role of asymptomatic dogs as reservoirs of CPV in rural areas, mainly close related to wildlife carnivores in protected areas of Brazil.

[1] [2] [3] [4] These non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) comprise small RNAs such as microRNAs 5 as well as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, only a minute fraction of the large number of non-coding gene products has been identified or characterized at all. The few individual examples studied in greater detail provide evidence that lncRNAs can execute a broad range of important functions in the cell. [6] [7] [8] Individual long ncRNAs have been implicated e.g., in gene regulation, [9] [10] [11] splicing control, [12] [13] [14] or X chromosome dosage compensation. 15, 16 Notably, some of the lncRNAs have also been implicated in human diseases and most importantly in cancer
The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, MALAT1, is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has been discovered as a marker for lung cancer metastasis. It is highly abundant, its expression is strongly regulated in many tumor entities including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as physiological processes, and it is associated with many RNA binding proteins and highly conserved throughout evolution. The nuclear transcript MALAT-1 has been functionally associated with gene regulation and alternative splicing and its regulation has been shown to impact proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion.
here, we have developed a human and a mouse knockout system to study the loss-of-function phenotypes of this important ncRNA. In human tumor cells, MALAT1 expression was abrogated using Zinc Finger Nucleases. Unexpectedly, the quantitative loss of MALAT1 did neither affect proliferation nor cell cycle progression nor nuclear architecture in human lung or liver cancer cells. Moreover, genetic loss of Malat1 in a knockout mouse model did not give rise to any obvious phenotype or histological abnormalities in Malat1-null compared with wild-type animals. Thus, loss of the abundant nuclear long ncRNA MALAT1 is compatible with cell viability and normal development.
where lncRNAs can be deregulated or actively contributing to tumorigenesis. [17] [18] [19] [20] One of the first lncRNA genes discovered was MALAT1, the metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, 21 later also referred to as NEAT2 for nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2. MALAT1 is highly abundant and is expressed in many healthy organs, most strongly in pancreas and lung. 21 Deregulation or a functional role for MALAT1 have now been established in many human cancer entities including lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), uterine endometrial stromal sarcoma, cervical cancer, breast cancer, osteosarcoma and colorectal cancer, but MALAT1 has also been linked to viral infection or alcohol abuse. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MALAT1 is significantly associated with metastasis and serves as an independent prognostic marker for patient survival in early stage lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. 21, 30 It promotes cell motility of lung cancer cells 31 and supports generate functional lncRNA knockouts also in human cell lines using zinc finger nucleases to stably integrate RNA destabilizing elements into the human genome site-specifically at the start of an lncRNA gene. 41 Here, we exploit this technique and achieve the efficient silencing of MALAT1 expression in human lung and liver cancer cells. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that the lncRNA MALAT1 is not essential for cell proliferation, cell cycle progression or maintenance of nuclear architecture. Our human loss-of-function model is complemented by a Malat1 knockout mouse model. Malat1-null mice are viable and without any histological signs of developmental defects. Thus, the loss of the highly abundant, nuclear enriched and evolutionarily conserved lncRNA MALAT1 is unexpectedly compatible with life and development.
Depletion of MALAT1, a highly conserved and abundant lncRNA, from human cancer cells. As a first indication for the putative functional relevance of MALAT1, we verified its evolutionary conservation, strong expression and regulation. The lncRNA MALAT1 displayed a high level of sequence conservation throughout 33 mammalian species (Fig. 1A) . In human cells, MALAT1 showed a ubiquitous expression, as it is detected in immortalized primary human cells (1°FF and HEK293) as well as in a broad range of cancer cell lines derived from different tissues (Fig. 1B, left panel) . In addition, MALAT1 was highly abundant and even exceeded the expression of classical housekeeping genes like for example RPLP0 (ribosomal protein, large, P0) ( Fig. 1B right panel) .
Based on this pattern of conservation and high expression, we aimed for unraveling the role of MALAT1 in cancer cells as well as in normal development. Therefore, we employed an innovative approach that we recently developed to create highly specific and efficient loss-of-function models of abundant ncRNAs in human cancer cell lines. 41 This approach relies on the stable and site-specific integration of RNA destabilizing elements into the cancer cell genome mediated by zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Fig. 1C) . The ZFN binds to a specific site in the genome and introduces a DNA doublestrand break. When a repair template is present, this break is repaired via homologous recombination allowing a site-specific integration of exogenous sequences. Here, we integrate a cassette comprising the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a selection marker and a polyadenylation signal (polyA), which functions as the RNA destabilizing element silencing downstream sequences.
Previously, we had only generated A549 bulks of lung adenocarcinoma cells deficient of MALAT1. 41 Here, we extended the loss-of-function model to the liver cancer line HLE (hepatocellular carcinoma). As in A549 cells, MALAT1 was specifically and very efficiently suppressed in stable HLE lines. We obtained single cell MALAT1 knockout clones (KO) in both cancer cell lines with a 1000-fold reduction of MALAT1 expression in A549 KO clones and over 200-fold reduction of MALAT1 in HLE KO clones (Fig. 1D) . This approach depleted the full-length MALAT1 transcript: two different qRT-PCR primer pairs located at either proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells by regulating CASPASE-8, CASPASE-3, BAX, BCL-2 and BCL-XL. 22 Furthermore, MALAT1 is functionally important for trophoblast invasion during embryonic development 32 and is associated with synaptogenesis. 33 In summary, MALAT1 is strongly expressed in many tissues, significantly regulated under various physiological and pathological conditions and has been linked to a plethora of functions at the cellular level including proliferation, apoptosis, migration or invasion.
At the molecular level, multiple functions have been proposed for MALAT1. 11, 13, 14, 33, 34 MALAT1 is retained in the nucleus and specifically localizes to nuclear SC35 speckles that play a role in pre-mRNA processing. 35 MALAT1 might regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing by modulating the phosphorylation levels of serine/arginine splicing factors. 13 Depletion of MALAT1 might alter the pre-mRNA processing of tissue factor or endoglin transcripts. 34 Importantly, MALAT1 might interact with the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and thus controls the relocation of growth control genes between polycomb bodies and interchromatin granules, places of silent or active gene expression, respectively. 11 Additionally, MALAT1 RNA is frequently found in many PAR-CLIP experiments as a common interaction partner of RNA binding proteins potentially indicating further functions of MALAT1. 36, 37 Also, the MALAT1 transcript can be processed into a tRNA-like small cytoplasmic RNA, the mascRNA, which might fulfill additional, so far unknown functions. 38 Given all of these divergent potential activities, MALAT1 could function in a cell type-or tissue-specific manner despite its ubiquitous expression. Finally, MALAT1 is highly conserved throughout evolution across many mammalian species, underscoring its potential functional importance (Fig. 1A) .
In summary, these various lines of evidence culminate in the hypothesis that MALAT1 must be an important and most likely essential gene given its high and ubiquitous abundance, its specific regulation and localization patterns, its evolutionary conservation, its many interaction partners, molecular mechanisms and the strong impact of its deregulation on many cellular phenotypes including fundamental processes such as proliferation, migration or invasion.
The functional characterization of lncRNAs has greatly been hampered by a lack of quantitative loss-of-function models. Many lncRNAs-especially if they are nuclear, highly abundant or highly structured-can only be ineffectively targeted by RNA interference. In particular, this is a concern for studies of the highly abundant MALAT1, which was reduced only two-to 4-fold by shRNAs or siRNAs. 30, 31 Accordingly, these approaches make it difficult to distinguish between specific and off-target effects and their results may be prone to false-negative results due to an insufficient knockdown. Genetic knockout models have only been established for very few lncRNAs. For example, the Malat1-neighboring lncRNA Neat1 (nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1), which is essential for paraspeckle formation, has been knocked out in mice, but no phenotype has been reported so far. 39, 40 To overcome this challenge and to create quantitative loss-of-functions models, we have developed a strategy to with similar fractions of cells in G1-, S-and G2/M-phase, respectively ( Fig. 2B and D) . Thus, complete loss of MALAT1 did not impact cell proliferation or cell cycle progression in the lung and liver cancer cells studied here.
Loss of MALAT1 does not affect the global nuclear architecture. A number of studies point to a crucial role of RNA as an architectural factor for shaping the genome and its nuclear environment. 42 Since MALAT1 is a highly abundant RNA strongly enriched in the nucleus, we hypothesized that its loss might affect the structural organization of the nucleus. 35, 38 Accordingly, we examined the effect of the MALAT1 knockout with respect to several nuclear subcompartments for which an architectural role of RNA has been reported previously. RNA-dependent changes in nuclear morphology at a resolution of 200-300 nm can be directly detected after fluorescent labeling via evaluation of optical sections acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as demonstrated in RNase microinjection experiments. 43 end of the MALAT1 transcript yielded the same negative results for MALAT1 expression in the knockout cell clones (Fig. 1D) .
MALAT1 is not critical for lung or liver cancer cell proliferation. One of the most prominent characteristics of cancer cells is their ability to proliferate-even in the absence of external stimuli due to deregulated signaling cascades. We used our knockout system to analyze the role of MALAT1 in lung and liver cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, we performed cell cycle analyses and proliferation assays with a panel of three MALAT1 wild-type (WT) control cell lines and three KO clones per cell line ( Fig. 2A-D) . As control cells, we included the parental cell lines (A549; HLE) and two WT single cell clones for each cell line that had undergone clonal selection at the same time as the KO clones. We compared the proliferation between WT and KO clones, but could not detect any significant differences in bromodeoxyuridine assays ( Fig. 2A and C) . Additionally, the cell cycle profiles did not significantly differ between WT and KO clones . On average, MALAT1 shows a 2.5-fold higher expression (p < 0.001) in these cell lines compared with the abundant housekeeping gene RpLp0 (B, right panel). (c) To deplete the highly abundant lncRNA MALAT1, a knockout approach was recently developed 41 that is schematically explained here. (D) This method allowed the generation of A549 (lung) and hLe (liver) single cell clones that showed a ~1000-fold or ~200-fold reduction of full-length MALAT1, respectively. Given is the average expression measured in three independent experiments +seM. at the pericentromeres, centromeres and telomeres are targeted to these chromosomal loci via RNA. 42 Accordingly, we investigated heterochromatin protein 1 α (HP1α) as a factor involved in establishing and maintaining the repressive state of pericentric heterochromatin and telomere repeat factor 2 (TRF2) as a marker
In the latter study, a compaction of the DNA distribution after DAPI staining revealed that nuclear RNAs are needed to maintain transcriptionally active chromatin compartments in a decondensed conformation. Active RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) can be visualized with an appropriate antibody and associates into distinct nuclear foci referred to as ""transcription factories."" 44 Accordingly, we tested whether the knockout of MALAT1 resulted in changes of the nuclear distribution of chromatin (DAPI, blue color in merged images in Fig. 3) , RNA (5-ethynyl-uridine label, Fig. 3A ) and RNAP II transcription factories (immunofluorescence, Fig. 3B ). No effect of the MALAT1 knockdown was apparent. In addition, the formation of additional lamin A invaginations in murine cells have been reported upon RNase A treatment. 43 In MALAT1 KO cells, the nuclear envelope structure did not change according to the lamin A staining (Fig. 3C) .
The nucleolus is a site of active RNAP I transcription and is also known to be dependent on RNAP II transcription since its inhibition results in the dissolution of nucleoli into so-called ""necklace"" structures. 42 The abundant MALAT1 transcript is found as an RNA component in purified nucleoli (Caudron-Herger and Rippe, unpublished), and we reasoned that MALAT1 could play a role for maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleolus. This was tested with UBF (upstream binding factor) as a marker protein for active rDNA genes. UBF reorganizes in the nucleus when the nucleolus structure is disrupted by RNAP II inhibition with α-amanitin. However, no differences were observed here between wild-type and MALAT1 knockout cells (Fig.  3D) .
MALAT1 had previously been closely linked to SC35 nuclear domains, 35 that are also referred to as splicing/nuclear speckles or interchromatin granules. RNA is an important structural component of these nuclear subcompartments. 45, 46 Unmethylated Pc2 (Polycomb 2) protein binds to MALAT1 in SC35 domains and thereby relocates growthcontrol genes to a nuclear environment that promotes their expression. 11 The knockdown of MALAT1 by RNA interference resulted in a redistribution of growth-control gene promoters between PcG bodies and SC35 domains toward the silencing environment of PcG bodies. 11 Thus, another potential function of MALAT1 could be maintaining the structure of SC35 domains and / or mediating interactions of genes with this nuclear subcompartment. However, within the resolution provided by our CLSM analysis, wildtype and knockout cells displayed no significant structural differences with respect to SC35 immunofluorescence (Fig.  3E) . Upon close inspection of confocal three dimensional stacks, it appeared that in some knockout cells the borders of the SC35 domains were slightly more diffuse than in wildtype cells. However, due to the irregular structure of the splicing speckles, we were unable to confirm the statistical significance of this observation.
As discussed previously, a number of proteins that fulfill architectural functions for the formation of heterochromatic regions Figure 4A . Verification of correct Malat1 targeting in ES cells and mice were performed by PCR and Southern Blot analysis ( Fig. 4B and C) .
For our initial analysis, we generated mice with a constitutive knockout of Malat1 by mating of animals harboring one conditional knockout allele with transgenic CMV-Cre deleter mice. The Cre-mediated deletion of Malat1 was confirmed by PCR analysis (Fig. 4D) . 47 The resulting heterozygous knockout mice were bred with each other to obtain Malat1-deficient offspring. Surprisingly, homozygous Malat1 -/mice were born alive, without indication of embryonic lethality (in total, 15 homozygous Malat1 -/knockout mice, 21 heterozygous Malat1 +/knockout animals and 7 wild-type Malat1 +/+ mice were obtained), and these animals displayed no apparent phenotype or pathological limitations when kept under normal stress-free conditions. Malat1 and Neat1 expression after knockout of Malat1. To validate the effective knockout of Malat1 in the mouse model, we determined the expression of Malat1 transcripts in eight different organs by qRT-PCR (Fig. 5A) . As expected, Malat1 expression was absent in all tissues obtained from homozygous Malat1 knockout mice. Importantly, we used three different amplicons covering the entire length of Malat1 to validate the quantitative loss of Malat1 over the entire transcript. Additionally, the expression of the lncRNA Neat1 was determined using two independent amplicons. Neat1 is a nuclear lncRNA that is essential for paraspeckle formation 39 and represents the neighboring transcript for the telomere shelterin complex. For both proteins, no changes in the nuclear localization were observed in the MALAT1 knockout as compared with the wild-type cell line ( Fig. 3F and G) . Thus, loss of MALAT1 had no detectable impact on the nuclear structures analyzed here.
Generation and analysis of Malat1-deficient knockout mice. To investigate the physiological function of Malat1 and to study Loxp (cre recombination) and FRT (Flip recombination) sites are indicated and allow individual removal of the complete Malat1 locus (cre) and the Neomycin (neo) resistance gene (Flip), respectively. probe 2: 3'external probe (located outside of the targeting vector) for southern blot analysis. (B) pcR analysis of genomic DNA prepared from single electroporated es cell clones. With the forward primer located in the neo resistance gene and the reverse primer hybridizing to the wild-type sequence at the 3'-end outside of the targeting construct, several es cell clones with the desired homozygous recombination were identified via a 2420 bp pcR fragment which is absent in clones without correct targeting. (c) southern Blot analysis with genomic DNA prepared from single electroporated es cell clones and digested with the restriction enzymes BamhI and XhoI. probe 2 recognized a 4.1 kb XhoI/ BamhI fragment in the correctly targeted locus, while the wild-type allele was identified via a 10.6 kb BamhI/BamhI fragment. All relevant restriction sites are indicated in (A). (D) To confirm cre-mediated deletion of Malat1 and to distinguish wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous Malat1 constitutive knockout mice, a three-primer-pcR-strategy was developed, resulting in two fragments with different lengths for the wild-type (120 bp) and the targeted (204 bp) locus.
ducts. Neither female nor male genitals, namely ovary and testis, showed any signs of developmental defects or false organ assembly showing characteristic ovarian follicles and tubular appearance of the testes (Fig. 6G) . Thus, the viable Malat1 KO upstream of Malat1. In only four out of eight organs, we detected a slight, but non-significant induction of Neat1 in Malat1-negative tissues arguing against a hypothetical role of Malat1 in regulating Neat1 expression in cis.
In the human MALAT1-deficient cell lines, NEAT1 expression also remained unaltered (Fig. 5B) .
Histomorphological analysis of WT and Malat1 KO organs. Different organs of Malat1 KO mice were analyzed histomorphologically, including brain, heart, lung, thymus, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, intestine and genitals (ovary and testis). Notably, we did not observe any differences related to organ development, organ architecture or organ size. Moreover, no tumors or signs of inflammation were detected in any of the analyzed tissues. Representative pictures of two wild-type (♀, ♂; Fig.  6 , left panel) and two knockout mice (♀, ♂; Fig. 6 , right panel) of brain, thymus, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney and genitals are shown.
Brain sections show proper assembly of the brain cortex with pyramidal neurons and oligodendroglial cells (Fig. 6A) . Thymic parenchyma is regularly divided into a cortical portion with densely packed lymphoid cells and a pale stained medullary portion (Fig.  6B) . Lung tissue showed a regular alveolar structure both in WT and Malat1 KO mice without any signs of edema, congestion or emphysema (Fig. 6C) . Liver parenchyma displayed the characteristic lobular organization with hexagonal appearance based on the distributions of portal areas and central venules. No signs of fibrosis or inflammation were visible (Fig.  6D) . Pancreatic tissue of both wildtype and Malat1 knockout mice was regularly subdivided into the exocrine part composed of acini and the pale stained endocrine part with prominent islets of Langerhans (Fig. 6E) . Mouse kidneys of WT and Malat1 KO mice showed a regular assembly of renal cortex showing glomeruli and tubules (Fig. 6F) as well as regularly structured medulla with loops of Henle and collecting quantified with three independent amplicons and Neat1 was quantified using two independent amplicons in lung, spleen, small intestine, kidney, brain, colon, liver and heart of four wild-type (WT) and three Malat1 knockout mice (KO). Gapdh served as reference gene and data was normalized to expression in normal lung which displayed the highest Malat1 and Neat1 expression. Depicted is the average expression +seM (B) NEAT1 was quantified in A549 and hLe cancer cell lines in the parental cell line, two wild-type clones (WT) and three MALAT1 knockout clones (KO) each. RN7SL1 served as reference gene, and data was normalized to expression in the wild-type cells. Depicted is the average expression +seM. in lung cancer cells before. 41 Here, this methodology also effectively shuts down MALAT1 expression more than 200-fold in human liver cancer cells. Hence, this knockout approach is more effective and more specific than standard RNA interference techniques 30, 31 to deplete this highly abundant lncRNA. In addition, we have generated Malat1 knockout mice using homologous recombination in ES cells to study the physiological function of Malat1 in a whole mammalian organism.
Remarkably, we find MALAT1 to be dispensable for cell viability, proliferation and development in the human and the mouse system, respectively. Given its many reported functional associations, its high expression, regulation and evolutionary conservation, this result is very surprising -in particular considering three previous findings: First, MALAT1 knockdown via RNA interference suppressed proliferation in CaSki cervical cancer cells 22 unraveling a critical role for MALAT1 in this cancer hallmark capability. Second, MALAT1 had been found to govern the transcription of growth control genes. 11 Lastly, MALAT1 had been associated with the trophoblast invasion and placenta function. 32 Despite all of the above mentioned evidence pointing to an important and and potentially essential function of MALAT1, our results clearly demonstrate that its quantitative loss in cancer cells does not affect proliferation and its knockout in mice does not affect viability or normal development.
These apparent discrepancies lead to the hypothesis that MALAT1 could have cell type-specific functions, e.g., might be important for cervical cancer cell proliferation, but not for other cell types including A549 and HLE cells. Depending on further in-depth investigations, it might serve as a paradigm for a lncRNA that is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved but nevertheless fulfills multiple different, non-essential and tissuespecific functions depending on the cellular environment or the availability of RNA-binding interaction partners.
Our findings also emphasize the need for clean and quantitative genetic loss-of-function models-as exemplified here in both a human as well as a murine system. RNA interference-based knockdown using siRNA or shRNA constructs undisputedly has its value in interrogating a gene for its function in vivo, but these approaches also need to be critically questioned for the efficiency and specificity of their knockdown, for possible off-target effects, and they need to be reproduced with a large number of siRNAs or shRNAs to validate a gene-specific effect. However, definitive answers on the question whether a gene is essential for metazoan development and viability or not can only be derived from knockout models.
While the Malat1 knockout mouse does not display any detectable developmental or lethality phenotype, future studies will be essential to expose these mice to different stresses and environments. Such experiments will potentially reveal differences between wild-type and knockout animals that are due to the loss of MALAT1 and further uncover its function in health and disease. Most interesting will be the studies on potential tumor phenotypes by crossing these mice to different cancer models since MALAT1 has been discovered and most often linked to malignant diseases. The first description of MALAT1 had identified it as a marker in lung cancer metastasis 21 and the mice did not display any signs of developmental or histological abnormalities.
The highly abundant, nuclear and evolutionarily conserved lncRNA MALAT1 had been associated with many important cellular functions, linked to molecular mechanisms and was found to be deregulated in many physiological and pathological conditions. 11, 13, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] 35, 38 Thus, we aimed to generate genetic knockout models to study its function and significance in vivo. Loss-of-function models were successfully established in human cancer cell lines as well as in a knockout mouse model. The zinc finger nuclease-mediated insertion of polyA signals into the MALAT1 locus has been proven to be effective in gene silencing (mouse α-SC35, Sigma-Aldrich), HP1α (Euromedex) and TRF2 (Calbiochem/Merck). For confocal fluorescence imaging, a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a HCX PL APO lambda blue 63x/1.4 NA oil immersion objective was used.
Establishment of an inducible Malat1 knockout mouse model. The mouse Malat1 gene locus was subcloned from the BAC clone RP24-290K10 (BACPAC Resources Center, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute; the library RP24 was generated from a single male C57Bl/6J mouse). For the construction of the Malat1 knockout targeting vector, a previously published methodology and protocol was adjusted and used. 48 Briefly, short 500 bp homology arms (one 7 kb upstream of the Malat1 transcription start (5'-arm) and one 1.9 kb downstream of the Malat1 transcript (3'-arm) were amplified by PCR with BAC clone RP24_290K10 as template DNA and inserted via restriction/ligation into the pKoII vector backbone. The BAC clone was electroporated into the recombination-competent E. coli strain SW106. 48 The bacteria are available from the NCI Frederick (https://notendur.hi.is/bmo/Recombineering%20 Website.htm). The bacteria were transformed with the XhoI/Sal1 linearized pKoII vector. In the bacteria, the Malat1 locus with the 7 kb upstream and the 1.9 kb downstream areas was recombined into the pKoII vector backbone. Genomic sequences directly downstream of the murine Malat1 gene were amplified by PCR and inserted in front and behind the FRT-Neo-FRT-loxP cassette human and murine knockout models presented here now allow the in-depth analysis whether MALAT1 might also represent an active player in the metastatic cascade despite not being an essential gene for life and development.
Cell culture. A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from ATCC (CCL-185). HLE hepatocellular carcinoma cells were a kind gift of Dr. Britta Skawran (Hannover Medical School). Cells were cultivated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 in DMEM + 10% FBS, 0.2 mM Glutamine and antibiotics. A549 and HLE MALAT1 KO cells were generated as previously published. 41 RNA isolation and DNase I digest. RNA from cancer cell lines was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Samples were treated with DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37°C followed by a phenol:chloroform extraction and an ethanol precipitation at -80°C. For mouse tissue RNA isolation from snap frozen samples, the AllPrep RNA/DNA kit (Qiagen) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR. RNA (1-2 μg) was reverse transcribed with RevertAid™ reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Complete removal of genomic DNA was controlled in minus-RT samples in which the reverse transcriptase was replaced by water. For qRT-PCR, the ABI PowerSYBR Green PCR Master Mix was used, and the analysis was performed with an ABI StepOne Plus cycler (Life Technologies). Primer sequences can be found in Table 1 .
Proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed with the Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU assay (Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 5 x 10 3 were seeded into black 96-well plates with a clear bottom (Greiner Bio-One). After 48 h, the BrdU solution (10 μM f.c.) was added and the cells were incubated for 6 h. The chemiluminescence was measured with a luminometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL; Thermo Scientific).
Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle distribution of exponentially growing cells was analyzed according to standard protocols using Propidiumiodide (PI) staining for DNA content. Briefly, 3 x 10 5 cells were seeded 48 h prior to analysis in 10 cm dishes in normal growth medium. Cells were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), scraped off the plates using a rubber policeman, fixed in ethanol, and RNA was digested with RNase A. Cell pellets were resuspended in PI staining solution (40 μg/mL f.c. PI in PBS). Cell cycle profiles were acquired using a BD FACS Calibur and analyzed using the Cell Quest Pro software (Becton Dickinson).
Fluorescence microscopy analysis of nuclear structures. Immunofluorescence, RNA staining via labeling of incorporated ethynyl uridine and staining of the DNA with 4',6-diamidin-2'-phenylindol-dihydrochlorid (DAPI) were conducted after para-Formaldheyde (PFA) fixation as described previously. 43 The antibodies used detected active RNA polymerase II (H5, GeneTex), lamin A (provided by Harald Herrmann-Lerdon, DKFZ), UBF (provided by Ingrid Grummt, DKFZ), SC35 for the Malat1-deleted locus. PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec 95°C, 30 sec 56°C, 30 sec 72°C, and a final elongation for 10 min at 72°C. Histomorphological analysis. Mice were sacrificed at the age of 6 weeks. Tissues were resected, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for subsequent staining. Five micrometer sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) according to standard procedures. Histopathologic review of the H&E slides for histopathologic abnormalities was performed using an Olympus BX51 microscope and pictures were taken using a ProgRes ® CMOS camera (Jenoptik). All animal experiments were done in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and according to the regulations issued by the Committee for Animal Rights Protection of the States of Hessen (Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel 2007. Significance was assessed using T-Tests after determination of the variance equality using an F-Test.

Life-threatening manifestations at presentation are rarely reported and should be an important clinical concern. We report a case of a 63-yearold man presenting with rapid-onset refractory severe thrombocytopenia, development of massive hemoptysis, and death from respiratory failure. This case provides clinicians a reference for this unusual presentation and carries clinical implications for managing SCLC patients.","Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 15-20% of all lung cancers [1] . SCLC differs from non-small-cell lung cancer in its rapid tumor doubling time, high growth fraction, early development of widespread metastasis, and better response to platinum doublets chemotherapy. Thus chemotherapy is a treatment mainstay, even in poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status [2, 3] . Bone marrow involvement or paraneoplastic syndrome is common in patients with SCLC [4] . Hematologic abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are reported to be occasionally accompanied by bone marrow metastasis or paraneoplastic phenomenon [5, 6] . However, complications such as fatal hemorrhage are rarely reported. The clinical presentation can make diagnosis or treatment difficult. Herein, we report an SCLC patient who presented with rapid-onset, refractory severe thrombocytopenia and development of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage.
A 63-year-old man visited an outpatient clinic complaining of cough and dyspnea (Borg scale 4). He was a current smoker of 20 pack-years and denied histories of taking any medications or illness including cardiovascular, allergic, rheumatologic or respiratory diseases. A complete blood count revealed values within normal range, except for a lower value of platelet count, 91,000/mm 3 . Increased haziness on the lower lobe of the right lung was noted on his chest radiography.
When he returned after 10 days, he was admitted with blood-tinged sputum and aggravated dyspnea (Borg scale 6). His ECOG performance status was two. He was afebrile. An arterial blood gas study revealed pH 7.44, PaCO 2 37.5 mmHg, PaO 2 77.6 mmHg, HCO 3 25 mmol/L, and SpO 2 95% on room air. Complete blood count results were as follows: leukocytes 6,270/mm 3 (neutrophil 61.2%, lymphocyte 27.5%, monocyte 3.9%, eosinophil 3.9%, and basophil 0.7%), hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL, hematocrit 29.6%, and platelets 11,000/mm 3 . The serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 1,324 IU/L; C-reactive protein, 6.40 mg/dL. Hepatic and renal function testing were within normal range. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer were within normal range as well. A 1.6 cm sized mass in the lower lobe of the right lung and multiple lymphadenopathies in mediastinal and right supraclavicular areas were noted on chest CT scan ( Fig.  1) . A peripheral blood smear revealed leukoerythroblastosis with nucleated erythrocyte, left shifted neutrophils. Anti-platelet antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative. Anti-nuclear antibody was within Pulmonary hemorrhage at SCLC presentation normal range (1:20). Because of the risk of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia, a bronchoscopic examination was not feasible and was postponed. A bone marrow examination was not performed because the patient was unable to maintain prone position due to dyspnea. Platelet concentrates and packed red blood cells were started, given daily, and dexamethasone, 40 mg was intravenously administered for four days. However, his platelet count remained stationary (Fig. 2) . On the fifth day after admission, cytological examination of his sputum yielded a diagnosis of SCLC. Metastatic lesions were not observed on brain MRI and bone scintigraphy.
On the seventh day, massive hemoptysis (≥ 200 mL per day) abruptly occurred and his dyspnea was rapidly aggravated to 8 of Borg scale. A chest CT scan revealed diffuse ground glass opacities and consolidation in both lung fields. Tranexamic acid and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics including piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin were initiated intravenously. Sputum gram stain and culture for bacteria and fungus revealed no organism. Sputum culture for adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus, and enterovirus were negative. Antibody studies for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and rickettsia were negative, as was an antigen study for Streptococcus pneumoniae. His arterial blood gas study showed pH of 7.49, PaCO 2 of 28.7 mmHg, PaO 2 of 58.3 mmHg, HCO 3 22 mmol/L, and SpO 2 91 % on oxygen supplied via reservoir mask flow rate 15L/min. On the tenth day, he was intubated and ventilated mechanically. He rapidly deteriorated and died of respiratory failure on the twelfth day. His family did not want to have a postmortem examination, against physician's recommendation.

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing an SCLC patient presenting with fatal pulmonary hemorrhage due to refractory thrombocytopenia. SCLC is the most aggressive histological subtype of lung cancer. However, favorable response is expected in 60% to 70% of patients with extensive-stage disease when systemic chemotherapy is given [3, 4] . Life-threatening manifestations rarely present in SCLC patients. When such manifestations do appear, as in the present case, the rapid-onset, unusual presentation may delay diagnosis or hesitation in deciding treatment, affecting survival adversely [7] . Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment is a critical issue [8] .
Hematological abnormalities including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are commonly observed due to the toxicity of anti-cancer therapy. However, hematologic abnormalities resulting from bone marrow metastasis and paraneoplastic phenomenon are not as common as those resulting from anti-cancer therapy [5, 6] . Severe thrombocytopenia developed rapidly and was refractory to platelet transfusion and dexamethasone administration. In addition, tests for anti-platelet antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative and anti-nuclear antibody was within normal range. These findings indicate that autoimmune disease was not likely to be the cause of thrombocytopenia [9] . Bone marrow examination is a diagnostic process for evaluating hematological abnormality or staging the disease. However, it rarely changes the stage [10] and bone marrow as an isolated metastatic site is found in fewer than 5% of SCLC patients [3] . Leukoerythroblastic reaction on peripheral blood smear is suggestive of bone marrow metastasis in the present case [11, 12] . Although bronchoscopy may be considered for localization or treatment in massive hemoptysis, it is contraindicated in a patient with severe thrombocytopenia [13] .
A diagnostic and treatment plan should be determined after taking into account the benefit and risk on an individual patient basis. It is challenging to do in every possible case. The clinical presentation of the current case is unfamiliar to clinicians and rapid-onset, life threatening. However, prompt treatment with systemic chemo-therapy should have been considered because he was considered fit for systemic chemotherapy by virtue of his younger age, acceptable ECOG performance status, and absence of comorbid diseases.",Small-cell Lung Cancer Presenting as Fatal Pulmonary Hemorrhage,"Lim, Jun Hyeok; Ryu, Jeong-Seon; Cho, Sang Yong; Kim, Hyun-Jung; Jeon, Sang Hoon; Kim, Jung Soo; Nam, Hae-Seong; Cho, Jae Hwa; Kwak, Seung Min; Lee, Hong Lyeol",Open Med (Wars),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5874507/,73,1063,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structural glycoprotein, VP7, a 38-kD integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), presumably transfers to vi.rus in this process. The gene for VP7 potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids which has two tandem hydrophobic domains at the NH2-terminal, each preceded by an in-frame ATG codon.
A series of deletion mutants constructed from a full-length cDNA clone of the Simian 11 rotavirus VP7 gene were expressed in COS 7 cells. Products from wild-type, and mutants which did not affect the second hydrophobic domain of VP7, were localized by immunofluorescence to elements of the ER only. However, deletions affecting the second hydrophobic domain (mutants 42-61, 43-61, 47-61) showed immunofluorescent localization of.VP7 which coincided with that of wheat germ agglutinin, indicating transport to the Golgi apparatus. Immunoprecipitable wild-type protein, or an altered protein lacking the first hydrophobic sequence, remained intracellular and endo-~-N-acetylglucosaminidase H sensitive. In contrast, products of mutants 42-61, 43-61, and 47-61 were transported from the ER, and secreted. Glycosylation of the secreted molecules was inhibited by tunicamycin, resistant to endo-~-Nacetylglucosaminidase H digestion and therefore of the N-linked complex type. An unglycosylated version of VP7 was also secreted. We suggest that the second hydrophobic domain contributes to a positive signal for ER location and a membrane anchor function. Secretion of the mutant glycoprotein implies that transport can be constitutive with the destination being dictated by an overriding compartmentalization signal.","the portions of the expressed products that are important in determining their plasma membrane localization. These membrane glycoproteins are characterized by a COOH-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchoring segment and a cytoplasmic tail. Disruption of the former has generally resulted in complete secretion of these molecules, which in their native state traverse most of the secretory pathway. Alterations of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail had diverse effects. Some mutant proteins became blocked along the secretory pathway and others failed to traverse the pathway at all. The exact nature of the signal for targeting these proteins to the plasma membrane was not clear from these studies. Failure of these molecules to move along the exocytosis pathway may have been due to the alteration of a positive plasma membrane targeting signal or to denaturation of the protein product.
Rotavirus VP7 is a glycoprotein of particular interest as a potential model for the study of protein transport (21) . This protein associates with viral cores that bud into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) j (1) from cytoplasmic structures, called viroplasms. Mature virus remains within the lumen of the RER until release by cell lysis. VP7 is an integral membrane glycoprotein with a lumenal orientation (21) and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (10, 32). The Golgi apparatus is not involved in processing the mature form of VPT, a fact confirmed by the presence on the molecule of the high-mannose form of carbohydrate (9) . VP7 therefore constitutes an example of a membrane glycoprotein that is targeted to the ER and is not subsequently directed further along the secretory pathway. The cloning and sequencing of the SA 11 VP7 gene revealed the presence of two tandem NH2-terminal hydrophobic domains in the protein, and the absence of a COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain (7) . Each of the hydrophobic domains is preceded by an AUG codon and could ostensibly serve as a signal peptide for the translocation of VP7, depending on which codon is read for initiation. However, the specific role of each of these codons and hydrophobic segments in VP7 synthesis is not clear. In studying the function of the hydrophobic domains, we constructed a series of deletions in the VP7 gene. Three mutants were obtained for which the VP7 proteins acquired complex carbohydrate, as distinct from the high-mannose type exhibited by wild-type VP7, showing that they traversed the secretory pathway and reached the Golgi apparatus. These proteins were also secreted. A priori, the transport of VP7 to more distal locations along the secretory route should require either the modification of a positive signal specifying ER location, or alternatively, the addition of a signal enabling vectorial transport to occur. The induction of VP7 secretion by creating various deletions in the protein is more easily explained by the disruption of a positive signal specifying ER location. We conclude that there must be a positive signal for retention of a protein in the ER. Since wild-type VP7 is naive to the secretory pathway, it is also implied that in the absence of overriding sorting signals, secretion is constitutive.
Expression: Standard molecular cloning techniques were used in this work (29) . The complete sequence of genomic segment nine of Simian 11 rotavirus was obtained previously using a partial length cDNA clone that lacked 5'terminal sequences (7) . A full-length clone was isolated using a modified cloning strategy (20) . This yielded a VP7 clone inserted in the Pst I site of pBR322 which was confirmed as full length by terminal sequence analysis (30) . The insert was excised with Pst I, digested with nuclease Bal 31 to remove G:C homopolymer tails, and the blunt-ended molecule was flanked with Xho I sites by the addition of phosphorylated Xho I linkers (P-L Bioehemicals revealed that pJC 16 nevertheless contained residual homopolymeric sequences (15G residues) at the 5'-end of the gene. These were removed by replacing the 5'-terminal region of the clone proximal to the Nco I site with a fragment that lacked the residual homopolymeric tail. An Aha llI-Nco I fragment was prepared from the SAIl VP7 clone, Xho I linkers were added to the Aha III end, and after recutting, the Xho l-Nco I fragment was cloned into the SV40 vector to generate the plasmid pJC9 (Fig. 1 ).
Bam HI and the 387-bp 5'-terminal fragment of the VP7 gene ( Fig. 1 ) was subcloned into the Barn HI site of pBR322 to generate pBR9B ( Fig. 1) 1 ) and a fragment from the same plasmid, which extended through the VP7 gene, counterclockwise from the EcoR I site to the Cla I site near the 5'-end of the gene (7). The fourth fragment which permitted the vector to circularize was an Xho 1/Nco I fragment of 53 bases derived from a pBR9B deletion mutant ( Fig. 1 ) , where the Bal 31 digestion went precisely to the first ATG codon. This construction deleted the first eight amino acids of VP7 which are conserved between human, simian, and bovine rotaviruses, and substituted Met-Ala-Met such that the final NH2-terminal sequence now reads as Met-Ala-Met-Val-Leu-Thr .......
Polyclonal Anti-VP7 Antiserum: SAIl rotavirus was propagated and purified by published procedures (37) . Intact double-shelled virions labeled with 1251 (26) were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and disrupted by boiling in an SDS dissociation buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (25) . Viral polypeptides were resolved by electrophoresis on discontinuous slab gels (25) and the band corresponding to VP7 located by radioautography. The region of the gel containing the SDS-denatured VP7 was recovered, homogenized with incomplete Freund's adjuvant, and injected subcutaneously into rabbits. Animals were boosted at 4-wk intevals and the antiserum confirmed as monospecific by Western blot analysis (42) .
Cell Growth, Transfection, Tunicamycin Treatment, and Radiolabeling: The RRI strain of Escherichia coli was used for the propagation of all plasmid DNA used for transfections. After standard bacterial lysis procedures (29) , DNA was isolated and purified by cesium chlorideethidium bromide ultracentrifugation followed by precipitation and resuspension in water. The procedure for transfection of COS 7 cells (18) follows that of published procedures (34) with several modifications. COS 7 cells were grown on 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME) (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY), containing 5% each of calf and fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ~g/ml streptomycin (Gibco Laboratories) and 2 mM L-glutamine. Monolayers that were 60-80% confluent were washed and transfected in Tris-buffered saline (19) . DNA (l 5-30 ~g/ml) was added to each plate followed by the addition of DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ; 2 × l06 daltons; 500 ug/ml) (19) . After 1.5-2 h at 37""C, the Tris-buffered saline solution was removed and DME, containing serum as above and 100 uM chloroquine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), was added to the cells. After incubation for 3 h at 37""C, DME without chloroquine but containing serum and additions as above was added. At 45 h after DNA/ DEAE-dextran removal, the cells were incubated at 37""C for l h in DME salts lacking serum and methionine but supplemented with all other amino acids and l mg/ml glucose. Transfected cells were then labeled for 2.5 or 4 h at 37""C on a rocker platform in the above medium to which L-[35Slmethionine at a concentration of 150 uCi/ml was added. At the end of the labeling period, the medium was collected and non-adherent cells were pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge for l0 min. Supernatants were removed and analyzed for expressed secreted material.
For those cells treated with tunicamycin, dishes were incubated in medium containing tunicamycin (Sigma Chemical Co.), at a final concentration of 2 In the complete VP7 clone used for these studies, two conservative amino acid changes occurred compared with the originally published sequence derived from an incomplete clone (7) . C32 and L~7 are both changed to F. #g/ml (41) , beginning at 42.5 h after transfection and continuing for 8 h thereafter. Tunicamycin was therefore present for 4 h prior to radiolabeling, including the l-h preincubation in medium lacking methionine, as well as during the 4-h labeling period.
Immunoprecipitation: Cell monolayers were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), harvested, and lysed in buffer containing 1% each of deoxycholate and Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.15 M NaCI in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 U/ml Traysylol. The nuclei were pelleted (34) after the addition of more detergent. Standard procedures (3), with some modification, were used for immunopreeipitation of proteins from the postnuclear supernatant by rabbit polyclonal antiserum to VP7 and protein Aconjugated Sepharose C1AB (PAS) (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals). Beads were swollen in distilled water and added to transfected cell lysates before incubation with antibody. PAS beads were pelleted by centrifugation and discarded (12) in an attempt to eliminate any nonspecifically adherent proteins. Polyclonal anti-VP7 serum was then added to lysates which were incubated at 4""C overnight before the addition of PAS beads. These had been preincubated for several hours in a solution containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and a postnuclear cell lysate of unlabeled, untransfected COS 7 cells.
Medium from the transfected cell cultures had an equal volume of 2x lysis buffer added which contained 1 mM methionine and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Rabbit polyclonal anti-VP7 antiserum was added to each and incubated overnight at 4""C, followed by the addition of pre-absorbed PAS beads.
In an effort to reduce background bands from the media in other experiments, such as that examining the effect of tunieamycin, PAS beads were additionally pre-absorbed with media from COS 7 cell cultures. Beads were pelleted from all samples and washed extensively in buffers containing detergent and then in PBS (3). After boiling the beads in 0.05 M Tris-HC1, pH 6.7, containing 1% SDS (34) to remove the bound antibody-protein complexes, 0.2 M citratephosphate buffer, pH 5.0, was added prior to treatment of half of each sample with 0.041 U of endo-fl-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo-H) prepared as described (39), at 37""C for 1 h. A lysate of L-[35S]methionine-labeled SA1 linfected MA 104 cells was prepared and treated with endo-H for use as a marker. The reactions were stopped by addition of buffer containing 100 mM Tris, 5% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 100 ug/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 200 U/ml Traysylol, 5 mM 8aminocaproic acid, 1 mM benzamidine, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were boiled for 3 min and analyzed by SDS PAGE on 12% gels (25) run at constant voltage. Gels were fixed, fluorographed in Amplify (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) for 20 min, dried, and then autoradiographed at -70""C using Kodak SB 5 film. Composites of photographs of gels were always assembled from equivalent or identical exposures with comparable markers.
Immunofluorescent Localization and Electron Microscopy: COS 7 cells which had been grown to semi-confluency on glass coverslips (Coming Glass Works, Coming, NY), in 35-ram dishes, were trans-feLLed in Tris-buffered saline as described above, washed with chloroquine for 3 h, and incubated with DME containing serum. At 47 h after removal of DNA/DEAE-dextran, cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 45 min at 22""C in 2% formaldehyde, freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde, and then buffered in 0.05 M phosphate, pH 7.5. The coverslips were rinsed in PBS for 20 rain, then soaked in I% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 rain to permeabilize the cells. After two 10-rain rinses in PBS, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 37""C in a solution containing polyclonal rabbit anti-VP7 diluted 1:400 in PBS and rbodamine conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (R-WGA) (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:300 or 1:400. The cells were then rinsed exhaustively in PBS and incubated in a 1:300 dilution of secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluoreseein (Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, PA) for 45 min at 37°(L Cells were photographed in the same plane of focus, with a Zeiss Ili RS photomicroscope, using appropriate filters for fluorescein or rhodamine.
To examine the ultrastructural morphology of untreated COS 7-and of SA1 l-infected MA104 cells (5.5 h post-infection, infected according to published methods [12] ), coverslips were fixed in 2% glutataldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 45 min at 22""C. Cells were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer, stained in 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in resin before thin sectioning. Sections were stained with uranyl rinse and Reynolds lead stain for several minutes (33) and then specimens were examined and photographed in a JEOL 100 CX electron microscope at 80 kV.
One novel feature of the rotavirus system is that the virus 2202 TNE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY -VOLUME 101, 1985 appears to be located primarily in elements of the ER (1). However, these earlier studies also showed that at 16 (Fig. 3) ; none were ever seen in the Golgi apparatus or in mitochondria. The viroplasm structures immediately adjacent to the RER were also evident and viral cores could be seen budding from the periphery of the viroplasm into the lumen of the RER. The envelope acquired from the RER membrane was subsequently lost and both enveloped and mature virions were visible in the lumenal space (Fig. 3) . VP7 has been located to the ER by immunoelectron microscopy (10, 32). In vitro translation studies have also shown it to be an integral membrane protein (2 I). Since the VP7 protein is found in mature virions and has only highmannose oligosaccharides (9), the data collectively show that VP7 remains in the ER after translation. However, the mechanism by which VP7 is incorporated into the virus remains unknown. Thus, the rotavirus VP7 provides an opportunity to study the factors controlling the specific localization of proteins to the ER.
To accurately interpret the localization of expressed VP7 protein products within COS 7 cells, it was necessary to examine the ultrastructural morphology and interrelationships of organelles in COS 7 cells, especially in the perinuclear region. These cells are characterized at their periphery by predominantly free polysomes crowding the cytoplasm and by numerous microvilli projecting from their cell surface (Fig.  4) . The cells are often multinucleate, have many lipid droplets, mitochondria, and a preponderance of organelles situated close to each other around the nucleus at the center of the cell (Fig. 4, a and b) . The perinuclear region is occupied by extensive branching ER, which contains numerous areas of transitional elements (Fig. 4 and inset) and smooth ER that spatially intertwine with, but are distinct from, the extensive perinuclear Golgi apparatus. It is evident that portions of the Golgi apparatus can surround concentrated elements of the ER.
The gene encoding the VP7 protein was inserted into the vector pJC119 under the control of the SV40 late promoter to generate the plasmid pJC9 (as described in the Materials and Methods). The expression of the VP7 protein from this gene was examined in transfected COS 7 cells to confirm the ER location of this protein. An indirect immunofluorescent procedure using a secondary fluorescein-coupled goat antirabbit Ig and a primary monospecific polyclonal rabbit anti. serum was used to localize VP7. A concomitant display of WGA, conjugated to rbodamine (R-WGA), and known to specifically bind to sialic acid and terminal glucosamines in the Golgi apparatus (40), allowed us to determine if VP7 was present in this organelle. The immunolocalizafion of VP7 expressed from pJC9 shows a distinct, arborizing, reticular pattern of fluorescein staining radiating from the nucleus, and a perinuclear concentration of stained, reticular material (Fig. These are composed of several viral proteins and nucleic acid which assemble into viral cores (arrows) that bud from the periphery of the viroplasm into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Immature viral particles with surrounding ER membrane appear in the lumen of the ER (large black arrowheads), as do numerous, nonenveloped, mature forms of the virion which are devoid of membrane (small black arrowheads). Several viral particles are indicated which apparently are in the process of losing the surrounding membrane (white arrowheads); possible membrane remnants can also be seen (m). M, mitochondrion, x 41,500. 5). This probably corresponds to the RER and to transitional elements of ER, spatially related to, but exclusive of, the Golgi apparatus (see Fig. 4b and inset). Nuclear staining is also evident. Fig. 5 b shows the same cell stained with R-WGA. A staining pattern consisting of punctate material and a perinuclear localization, probably coincident with part of the Golgi apparatus and distinct from that of the VP7 localization, is seen. Thus, VP7 protein expressed from the wild-type gene in pJC9 appears to localize to the ER and does not appear to reach the Golgi apparatus.
A series of plasmids containing mutations in the VP7 gene has also been constructed (see Fig. 2 ). The deletions were constructed in order to study the role of the hydrophobic domains in VP7 synthesis. The location of VP7 expressed from these plasmids in COS 7 cells was also examined by immunofluorescence. The deletion mutant 1-14 displayed extensive ER and perinuclear staining in regions distinct from that seen for R-WGA (Fig. 5, c and d) , similar to the wildtype. In this mutant, the first ATG codon was deleted so that only the second initiation codon and the hydrophobic region following it could be used (Fig. 2) . Another mutant studied, 2-8, in which the sequence following the first ATG codon was modified (see Materials and Methods), showed results analogous to the wild-type (Fig. 5 , e and f). In contrast, VP7 distribution in the mutants 42-61, 43-61, and 47-61, in which distal parts of the second hydrophobic domain were removed (Fig. 2) , showed reticular staining and a distinct perinuclear distribution which coincided precisely with, or was a subset of, the R-WGA staining pattern (Fig. 5, g-l) .
Thus it appeared that with these deletions, the mutant VP7 proteins reached the Golgi apparatus. Mutant 51-61, whose deletion removed a region distal to the hydrophobic domains, exhibited a staining pattern identical to the wild-type, that of reticular staining and a perinuclear distribution distinct from that of the R-WGA staining pattern. It appears that the absence of the region coding for these amino acids was not sufficient to cause movement of VP7 out of the ER to the Golgi apparatus.
To confirm and extend the above results, we also examined VP7 expression from wild-type and mutant genes by immunoprecipitating radiolabeled proteins from cell lysates (see Materials and Methods). Cells were transfected with plasmids containing the wild-type gene (pJC9) or deletions 1-14, 2-8, 42-61, 43-6 l, 47-6 l, or 51-61 (Fig. 2) . VP7 proteins were immunoprecipitated and displayed by gel electrophoresis before or after digestion with endo-H and compared on the same gel alongside L-[35S]methionine-labeled SAI l-infected MA104 cell lysate. No significant products were seen when either no DNA (Fig. 6 ) or the vector pJC119 was used as a control (see below, Fig. 8) . However, the wild-type and mutant genes all expressed a protein(s) precipitable with anti-VP7 antiserum (Fig. 6, -lanes) . In the case of the intact VP7 gene (pJC9) and the deletion 1-14, two products were seen in the absence of endo-H, but the lower band was relatively minor, not always reproducible, and its origin is uncertain. For mutants 42-61 and 51-6 l, two products were expressed and it is very likely that the lower molecular weight species was the nonglycosylated version of each protein. In the case of mutant 51-61, it is possible that the lower molecular weight band arises from use of the third in-frame AUG as a start The immunofluorescent localization of VP7 (left column) compared with that of R-WGA (right column) in transfected COS 7 cells. Fluorescein coupled to goat anti-rabbit IgG was used secondary to primary rabbit polyclonal antiserum to immunolocalize VP7. All pairs were photographed in the same plane of focus. Cells transfected with pJC9 (a and b); mutants 1-14 (c and d); 2-8 (e and/); 42-61 (g and h); 43-61 (i and j); 47-61 (k and/); or 51-61 (m and n). VP7 is localized to an arborizing structure probably corresponding to ER, as well as to a perinuclear reticular structure, possibly transitional ER elements, which are distinct from but close to that of the perinuclear punctate stain for WGA and the Golgi apparatus as displayed in a-f, and m and n. In some cases, a negative image of the staining region of VP7 is seen for WGA (c and d). By contrast, the three deletions shown in g-I not only exhibit the ER reticular localization for VP7, but also a prominent perinuclear staining region that is precisely coincident with, or a subset of, the staining pattern for WGA. × 126. codon. This possibility is made less likely because for mutant 42-6l a similar unglycosylated band of the same size is secreted, implying the use of a functional signal which would not be translated if the third AUG was used as an initiation codon. The wild-type and mutant genes each expressed a product which was sensitive to endo-H (Fig. 6, + lanes) , indicating that they were glycosylated with N-linked, highmannose oligosaccharides. There was no significant intracellular pool of VP7 products that were resistant to endo-H (Fig.  6 ). Cells were transfected and then incubated in the presence or absence of tunicamycin and the resulting unglycosylated products were slightly smaller in size than those treated with endo-H (data not shown), again indicating the N-linked nature of the oligosaccharide. Taken together, these results imply that each mutant codes for proteins which retain a functional signal for translocation into the ER. For the 1-14 deletion, where only the second ATG and hydrophobic domain are retained, the latter probably constitutes the signal peptide. For the wild-type and other mutants, the translocation signal domain cannot be specified since both ATG codons and hydrophobic regions are present. Transfected cells labeled for 2.5 h showed an overall similar pattern of expression of the intracellular VP7 products, and again there was little evidence of intracellular material resistant to endo-H (data not shown).
Immunofluorescence studies indicated that for mutants 42-61, 43-61, and 47-6 l, VP7 staining co-localized with that of elements of the Golgi apparatus in COS 7 cells, indicating that these VP7 mutants were probably transported out of the ER. Therefore, the incubation media from all the transfected cell cultures described above were examined for secreted VP7 products. Three of the deletion mutants, 42-61, 43-6 l, and 47-61, affecting the distal region of the second hydrophobic domain produced VP7 molecules which were secreted (Fig.  7) , in marked contrast to the behavior of the wild-type VP7 (pJC9), and the other mutants (51-61 in particular) (Fig. 7) . The latter differed by only four amino acids from the secreted 2206 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY • VOLUME 101, 1985 mutant 47-61 (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the secreted VP7 products were endo-H resistant (Fig. 7, + lanes) , consistent with their passage through the Golgi apparatus and their modification to the complex type of carbohydrate. Densitometry of respective bands of original autoradiographs used for Figs. 6 and 7, which were equivalently exposed, showed that similar amounts of secreted and intracellular VP7 were present. These results pertain to cells labeled for 4 h. However, similar results were obtained in a 2.5-h labeling period (data not shown), indicating that secretion is an efficient process. The size of the VP7 which contained complex oligosaccharides (VP7 c) was slightly larger than that of VP7 with the high-mannose form of glycosylation (VP7) (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 7) as expected from the known higher molecular weight of complex N-linked oligosaccharides. Mutant 42-61 also secretes, based on its size, a nonglycosylated version of its mutant VP7 protein (Fig.  7) . This was confirmed by another experiment where cultures transfected with mutants 42-6 l, 43-6 l, or 47-61 were subsequently treated with tunicamycin ( Fig. 8 , mutant 43-6 l only shown). The product generated in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 8 , + lanes) (VP7 u) is identical in size to the naturally occurring unglycosylated product of mutant 42-6 l (Fig. 7) . Some material the size of VP7 remained after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 8, lane 8) probably because of limiting amounts of the drug, since in other experiments tunicamycin resulted in complete conversion to VP7 u. In control cells, those not treated with tunicamycin (Fig. 8, lane 5) , the endo-H-resistant product was again secreted into the medium. Similar results were obtained with mutants 42-61 and 47-61 (data not shown). The amount of protein secreted in tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig. 8, lane 6) was lower than that of the control, possibly because the drug interferes with secretion. No such bands were identified when the vector (pJC 119), without VP7 gene insert, was used for transfection (Fig. 8,   lanes 1-4) . The presence of prominent nonspecific background bands (Fig. 8, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 6-8) , which are different for the intracellular (intra) and secreted (sec) lanes, does not alter this conclusion. These results confirm that the FIGURE 7 Endo-H sensitivity of immunoprecipitated products from the media of cells transfected with wild-type and mutated VP7 genes. Cells were labeled for 4 h with L-[3SS]methionine as described, the medium from each culture subjected to immunoprecipitation (-lanes), and half of the samples digested with endo-H (+ lanes). Total SA11-infected MA104 cell lysate before (-) and after (+) Endo-H displays marker glycosylated (VP7) and digested (pVP7) proteins. The length of exposure of this gel was equivalent to that of Fig. 6 .
endo-H-resistant products secreted into the medium by these mutants contain an N-linked complex type of carbohydrate. Secreted VP7 c was again observed to be endo-H-resistant (data not shown) and to be present in approximately the same amount as the internal endo-H-sensitive VP7 (Fig. 8, lanes 5  and 7) . In order to understand the specificity in the location of membrane glycoproteins, we have used a glycoprotein that is located in the ER in its natural state. ER location implies either the presence of a targeting signal specific for the ER or the absence of a positive signal that would otherwise direct the protein elsewhere. The structural glycoprotein VP7, of the rotavirus SA11, provides just such a naturally targeted ER protein. It is a membrane glycoprotein (21) before assembly into virus. How the transfer of the glycoprotein takes place is not known and we know of no other animal virus which exhibits this behavior. However, the mode of transfer of membrane protein to the virus particle resembles the assembly of coat protein into the filamentous phage M 13 (44) .
Analysis of the amino acid sequence of VP7 has shown the existence of two tandem NH2-terminal hydrophobic domains, within the first 50 amino acids. Each is preceded by an inframe ATG codon. Since the first ATG is ""weak"" and the second one has the preferred consensus sequence for initiation (24) , we cannot be sure which one is used for VP7 synthesis, and are unable to say where the reported signal peptide cleavage occurs (13) . Since mutant 1-14, which deletes the first ATG codon, still produces a glycoprotein located in the ER, the second hydrophobic domain can provide signal pep-PORUCHYNSKY lET AL.
carbohydrate. The positions of migration in this gel of VP2 (94k), VP7 (38k) (with high-mannose carbohydrate), and NCVP5 (29k) in infected cell lysates are shown.
Secretion of an Endoplasmic Reticulum Glycoprotein tide function. The NH2-terminal hydrophobic domains seem important in the maturation of rotaviruses since the hydrophobic nature is highly conserved in the VP7 glycoproteins of viruses infecting human, simian, and bovine species (20) , and therefore probably serve some role in anchoring this type of protein in the ER. There is no hydrophobic segment present at the COOH-terminus, a distinctive feature of the glycoproteins of plasma membrane maturing viruses. Our systematic generation of mutants affecting each or both of the hydrophobic regions was aimed at identifying the putative membrane anchor domain responsible for the ER location of the rotavirus VP7 glycoprotein.
The key observation is that in three of the deletion mutants extending into the second hydrophobic region, namely mutants 42-61, 43-61, and 47-61, the altered form of VP7 is secreted by transfected COS 7 cells and terminally glycosylated, a characteristic of a protein having traversed the normal secretory pathway. By contrast, neither the wild-type gene product was secreted, nor were products from deletions which affected other parts of the molecule. The deletion 1-14, which completely removed the first hydrophobic domain and mutant 2-8, in which the eight amino terminal residues conserved in all four rotavirus VP7 serotypes (9) were changed (see Materials and Methods), efficiently expressed glycoprotein located to the ER. Similarly, removal of only 11 amino acids downstream of the hydrophobic domains in mutant 51-6 l, apparently was not sufficient to influence the movement of VP7 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The only effect was to perturb the efficiency of glycosylation, perhaps for steric reasons, since the glycosylation site in the altered products is brought closer to the hydrophobic domains.
The carbohydrate present on VP7 is of the high-mannose type and is endo-H sensitive, consistent with its ER location and the absence of terminal processing of the oligosaccharide. Analysis of VP7 glycoprotein processing shows that it does not reach the Golgi apparatus but rather accumulates in a subcompartment of the ER in a processing pathway quite different from VSV G-protein (21) . In our current observations, it should be noted that there is a distinctly larger size of the secreted VP7s in mutants 47-61, 43-61, and 42-61, due to the terminal glycosylation; they are also sensitive to tunicamycin and resistant to endo-H. This observation underscores the ER location of wild-type VP7 since it is apparent that its N-linked glycosylation can be modified and were the wild-type molecule to have reached the Golgi apparatus, further processing and terminal glycosylation should have occurred. In the mutant VP7s, the efficiency of secretion appears to be high for two reasons. First, there is no endo-Hresistant material inside the cell after either 2.5 or 4 h of labeling. Second, the amount of material secreted is similar in amount to that seen intracellulady.
Other glycoproteins of the ER have been cloned and some sequenced. In the cases of HMG-CoA reductase (27) and coronavirus E 1 (4), there was no obvious homology between the NH2-terminal hydrophobic domains in these molecules and VP7, nor with the dual NH2-terminal hydrophobic domains in nonstructural rotavirus glycoprotein NCVP5 (8) . Cytochrome P-450 (31), another ER protein, did not display any obvious homologies in its multiple hydrophobic domains. It should be noted, however, that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, coronavirus El, and cytochrome P-450 probably interact with the lipid bilayer much more extensively than does VP7, via multiple membrane spanning domains. Since VP7 is not normally secreted, presumably there could be no specific ER receptor (14, 28) mediating its secretion, and therefore its movement along the secretory pathway in these cells is constitutive, rather than specific. This is the first demonstration of an alteration in the primary sequence which allows a naturally targeted ER molecule to be secreted, and shows unequivocally that glycoproteins can be secreted without the intervention of a specific receptor. Also of significance is that an unglycosylated, mutant VP7 is efficiently secreted. The precise reason(s) for the secretion of VP7 in the mutants 42-61, 43-61, and 47-61 is not yet clear. It could be that an anchor region has been shortened so that it no longer functions,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that a positive signal for ER location has been disrupted, or that a peptidase cleavage site, e.g., the Ala-Tyr-Ala sequence at residues 66-68 (43), has been brought into proximity of the aminopeptidase used for signal peptide cleavage. These possibilities are being investigated. Our results become particularly interesting when juxtaposed with several other observations. Firstly, some normally soluble molecules of the ER (2, 5) remain in the ER, whereas soluble VP7 is secreted. Secondly, influenza neuraminidase is anchored in the membrane by an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain, but this molecule, unlike VP7, is exported to the plasma membrane (6) . From the above, we conclude that the region of the second hydrophobic domain of VP7 not only serves to anchor the protein in the membrane but may also contain the positive and specific signal for maintaining the protein in the ER.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28,d1b24d21f2004ee1ed983d5fd7526ff2809443e6,"The One Health initiative is increasingly becoming a prominent discussion topic in animal and human health, with its focus on prevention of spread of zoonotic diseases, both in animals, and from animals to humans. An important part of One Health is that diagnostics and vaccines for diseases may be the same thingand be used for both humans and animals. One potential problem standing in the way of wider adoption of One Health principles, though, is that use of conventional cell fermentation systems for production of the recombinant proteins that could be used as diagnostics or vaccines is often expensive and is not easily scalable. A solution to this may be the use of plants or plant cells as bioreactors: molecular farming, or the production of biologics in plants, is now a well-established science with many proofs of principle and important proofs of efficacy for especially animal vaccines. This review discusses how molecular farming could enable important advances in One Health, using as examples plant-made vacccines, reagents and therapeutics for influenza viruses, ebolaviruses, rabies virus, bunyaviruses and flaviviruses.","The One Health initiative, formerly known as One Medicine, is ""…dedicated to improving the lives of all species -human and animal -through the integration of human medicine, veterinary medicine and environmental science"" (http://www.onehealthini tiative.com/mission.php). It is premised on the principle that the health of the Earth's people is connected to the health of its animals and of the environment, and encourages collaboration to achieve the best health for all of these. The initiative in its modern form dates from 2007, when a formal bond was established between the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and when an International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in New Delhi urged governments to build One Health linkages for pandemic preparedness and human health security. Adoption of the principles by the European Union and the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, and support from international bodies such as the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health, mean that while it is still a virtual initiative that does not provide funding, its influence on national and international health policies is significant. 1 The importance of the approach can be seen when one realizes that 6 out of every 10 infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic, or spread from animals (https://www.cdc.gov/one health/), and 7 out of 10 of emerging or re-emerging infections are vector-borne or zoonotic (http://www.onehealthinitiative. com/). There is particular interest in developing low-cost reagents for point-of-care diagnostics that could also be used as vaccines for animals and possibly also for humans, as these diseases mainly affect people and animals in developing countries, meaning that resources to study them are often lacking.
The kinds of emerging zoonotic disease agent that are of concern to One Health include those that are transmitted directly from wild animals to humans (eg: Sin Nombre hantavirus; Lassa fever arenavirus); agents that originate in wild animals and then spread human to human (eg: HIV-1 and -2; ebolaviruses); agents that are transmitted from wild to domestic animals to humans (eg: Nipah and Hendra henipaviruses); and those that move from wild to domestic animals then go on to be transmitted between humans (eg: pandemic influenzaviruses, SARS and MERS coronaviruses).
While the One Health concept is far wider than simply considering vaccines and diagnosticssomething that is shown very effectively here (http://www.onehealthinitiative. com/about.php) -provision of vaccines to combat the spread of disease agents, and of reagents to enable quick and inexpensive diagnosis of these, are an important component. A useful breakdown of the kinds of vaccines that would be useful is given here, 2 and is summarised below.
Framework I vaccines may be used for protection of humans and domesticated animals, where neither is central to the transmission cycle (eg: West Nile flavivirus). Framework II vaccines are to be used in domesticated animals to prevent disease in both animals and humans, for disease agents transmitted directly or indirectly via arthropod vectors from animals to humans (eg: vaccines for brucellosis, Escherichia coli O157, anthrax; rabies, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and Hendra / Nipah viruses). Framework III vaccines are intended for use in wild animals, to prevent transmission of disease both to domesticated animals and to humans (eg: rabies virus vaccines in oral baits, Mycobacterium bovis and Lyme disease vaccines). Anthrax and rabies are 2 good case studies for One Health. Anthraxcaused by Bacillus anthracis -is a disease of great antiquity; while the development of the live spore vaccine that is still used significantly reduced its incidence in livestock worldwide after 1937, outbreaks in domesticated animals are becoming increasingly common and outbreaks in wildlife are frequently underreported or undetected. 3 Humans are usually infected via exposure to infected livestock and to carcasses of wild animals, especially in Africa and other developing areas. There is also an increasing awareness of the potential use of B. anthracis spores as a biological weapon, which adds some urgency to the development of highly effective universal vaccines.
The control, and possibly even the global elimination of rabies virus disease, is also a good One Health test case. 4 While approaches such as the use of live vaccine baits have been effective in controlling the disease in Europe, for example, lowincome countries generally require different control strategies, and both cheaper vaccines and therapeutics in the shape of virus-neutralising antibodies to rabies virus, to limit endemicity and especially human disease.
The production of the kinds of complex biologics that constitute modern vaccines and diagnostic reagents is a well-developed science, albeit highly expensive. Veterinary and especially human vaccine production requires Good Manufacturing Practice, and typically involves sterile cell-based systems that include bacterial, yeast or fungal, and animal cells cultured in highly controlled environments that are expensive to establish, and costly to maintain. An alternative production system that promises far cheaper production of active pharmaceutical ingredient, if not of finished product, is ""molecular farming,"" or the use of plants and plant cells to make complex biologics. This field is in fact nearly 30 y old in 2017, and is becoming increasingly sophisticated: many proofs of concept and of efficacy for animal and human vaccines and therapeutics have been obtained, and several products are even licensed for human use (see reviews [5] [6] [7] [8] ).
This brief review will illustrate the potential applications of molecular farming to One Health, with examples drawn from the recent literature and from our lab's work.
Plant-made vaccines against influenza viruses are perhaps the poster children for molecular farming: many candidate vaccines made in plants have shown efficacy in animal models; candidate pandemic virus vaccines have been made to the scale of 10 million doses in less than a month, vaccines suitable for outbreak viruses similarly (see review 9 ). Efficacy to homologous challenge has been shown in mice, ferrets and chickens; so too has efficacy to heterologous challenge with high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1 in chickens. 10 While most of this work is directed toward protecting humans against potentially pandemic influenza viruses, it is often overlooked that the same vaccine candidates could be equally useful in birds and in swine: indeed, breaking the chain of recycling of influenza viruses that seems to occur in intensively farmed pigs is a prime goal of One Health. 11 Other targets for plant-made influenza vaccines include dogs 12 and potentially horses.
Our group investigated the potential for making influenza pandemic rapid response vaccines in South Africa by making influenzavirus A/Vietnam/1204/04 (H5N1) haemagglutinin by transient expression in N. benthamiana: 13 our success opened up the possibility of making H5 HA as a reagent and potentially as a vaccine, by means hitherto not available in Africa. We went on to use the HA2 portion of the protein as a virus-like particle (VLP)-based display vehicle in plant manufacture for the highly conserved M2e ectopic epitope as an elicitor of broadly neutralising antibodies to all influenzavirus A strains, as a candidate universal vaccine for humans and animals. 14 
Vaccines to protect against rabies viruses were an early target of molecular farming: as early as 2003, 15 it was suggested that plant-made rabies vaccines could be a useful tool for wildlife immunisation, specifically in the context of fruit bats in the genus Pteropus. These are hosts of many potentially humaninfecting viruses, including the henipaviruses Hendra and Nipah; Menangle and Tioman rubulaviruses, and Australian bat lyssavirus, which is a close relative of rabies virus. 15 Indeed, intraperitoneal immunisation of mice with purified extracts of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) expressing high concentrations of rabies virus G protein elicited comparable levels of immune response to the inactivated conventional vaccine, and complete protective immunity in mice against intracerebral lethal challenge with live rabies virus. 16 In a more recent study, sheep were protected from live virus challenge by oral immunisation with a single dose of transgenic maize kernels containing 2 mg of G protein. 17 The Canadian biotech company Medicago Inc. has also patented a rabies virus-like particle vaccine made in in plants, 18 and announced an expansion of their vaccine pipeline to include the new product. 19 It is also possible to produce effective anti-rabies monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in plants: 20 The potential of such biologics to replace the rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) of either equine or human origin that is normally used for rabies immunotherapy, and which is prohibitively expensive for developing countries, is a highly attractive prospect for future development. In a response to what is seen as a pressing health need in a rabiesendemic developing country, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa is producing a soon-to-be commercialised anti-rabies MAb called Rabivir in transgenic tobacco, which they claim is 10 times cheaper than the conventional alternative. 21 
Ebolaviruses have been part of One Health thinking for some time: several reviews have, in recent years, discussed the control of the viruses' emergence in the context of One Health, and in the context of zoonotic threats and the exotic animal practice. [22] [23] [24] An obvious target for their control, in humans but also possibly in other primates at risk like chimpanzees and gorillas, are vaccinesand this is one area of hope after the recent West African epidemic, where accelerated licensure and testing threw up several likely candidates, but one real success in recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV-ZEBOV). 25 This notwithstanding, subunit vaccines may yet be useful, for Zaire and other ebola-and marburgvirusesand investigations have been done on the vaccine potential of different viral proteins to throw up useful candidates, including as well as the obvious GP1 envelope glycoprotein, VP24, VP30, and VP40. 26 Toward this goal, several plant-made antigens have been shown to have potential. One novel approach was the expression of an Ebola immune complex (EIC) in N benthamiana, using a replicating geminivirus-derived vector. 27 The GP1 protein of Zaire ebolavirus was C-terminus fused to the heavy chain of a humanised 6D8 IgG mAb antibody, which specifically binds GP1: this was co-expressed with the 6D8 light chain and the assembled mAb::GP1 chimaera was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and protein G affinity chromatography. The mAb was functional in terms of binding C1q, and the chimaera formed a cross-linked immune complex with itself. BALB/C mice immunised subcutaneously with purified EIC produced anti-GP1 antibodies at levels similar to those elicited using a GP1 VLP vaccine. Another very recent approach was to make the ebolavirus matrix protein VP40 in plants: 28 this protein is highly multifunctional and elicits protective immunity in mice. 26, 29 Transgenic tobacco plants expressed an ER-targetted VP40 at levels of »3 mg/kg fresh weight of plant tissue. The protein was given orally or subcutaneously to BALB/C mice in 3 low-dose preparations (125 ng oral, 25 ng s/c) without adjuvants, and elicited reasonable responses. Both these proteins are candidate vaccines, and candidate low-cost reagents for ebolavirus diagnostic kits.
Perhaps the crowning achievement of molecular farming in recent years is one specifically related to the recent West African Zaire ebolavirus outbreak: this was the production and eventual accelerated clinical trial of the humanised mAb cocktail known as ZMapp TM by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, made by transient expression in N benthamiana. 30 This has been thoroughly described elsewhere, 9, 31 and suffice it to say here that this one product has done more in terms of raising the profile of plant-produced pharmaceutical products in general, and therapeutics in particular, than any other. In the clinical trial in West Africa, 36 trial participants were randomly assigned to each of the 2 study arms: mortality in ZMapp TM -treated participants was lower (8 of 36; 22 percent mortality) than in participants receiving standard-of-care alone (13 of 35; 37 percent mortality). While this was not statistically significant because the participant numbers were low, ZMapp TM -treated participants eliminated virus from the bloodstream faster, had more rapid resolution of symptoms and were discharged from care earlier, than untreated participants. Given this apparent success, the US Government has funded Kentucky BioProcessing to stockpile the MAbs, and Mapp is going ahead to license ZMapp TM as a therapeutic for use in subsequent Ebola disease outbreaks. 30 It should be noted that the MAbs should also be highly useful in the diagnostic arena.
While inexpensive vaccines that can be made profitably at small scale are one of the drawcards of the use of molecular farming, it is not generally appreciated that reagents for some of the world's more dangerous zoonotic pathogens are also expensive and hard or dangerous to make. The need for reagents is exemplified by a recent large study of seroprevalence in humans in Nigeria against the tick-borne Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever bunyavirus (CCHFV). 32 In South Africa, routine detection of antibodies in animals or in humans to CCHFV is done using the nucleoprotein (N) in ELISA tests: making this protein is a hazardous and expensive process, because it involves fractionating it from live virus prepared from CCHFV infected cell cultures or brain tissue of inoculated suckling mice, under high biosafety conditions. While it can also be prepared as a recombinant protein from both insect and mammalian cells, these methods are both expensive and the protein yields and quality are often not good.
Our group accordingly used Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in N benthamiana plants of a codon-optimised CCHFV N genewhich encodes the genome-associated nucleoprotein (NP) -to make a N-terminal 6xHis-tagged NP, that yielded »2mg protein / kg fresh plant material, was soluble, and was easily purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and immobilised metal ion chromatography. The protein was used in an anti-IgG ELISA with a standard panel of 13 serum samples collected 5-15 y post infection from patients confirmed to have anti-CCHFV IgG using commercial immunofluorescent antibody tests. Serum samples from 13 volunteers with no CCHFV infection history were used as a negative control panel. The plant-produced NP detected anti-CCHFV IgG in all positive serum samples, while all negative serum samples gave results below the cut-off value. The results suggest that recombinant NP expressed in plants has significant potential for use in both diagnosis and surveillance, while probably being a better, more easily produced and purified reagent than what is available presently.
Another innovative approach was the expression of a synthetic CCHFV envelope glycoprotein precursor (GcGn) polyprotein in leaves and induced hairy roots of transgenic tobacco plants: the material was immunogenic in mice via oral or parenteral immunisation routes, and GcGn purified from plants was an excellent ELISA plate coating antigen for detection of envelope glycoprotein-specific antibodies elicited by plantmade or conventional vaccines. 33 Rift Valley fever bunyavirus (RVFV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen of livestock that causes abortion storms in sheep and goats, and potentially lethal in humans, that is expanding its geographical range out of Africa into Arabia and elsewhere. 34 It is a matter of concern in the One Health movement because while there are effective veterinary vaccines, these are not necessarily safe, and there is no licensed human vaccine, 35 although experimental candidates that are safer in animals and may be suitable for humans, have been described. 36 A plant-made approach to a RVFV vaccine published recently described the expression in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana of the N protein and a soluble version of the Gn glycoprotein. 37 Oral dosing of fresh transgenic plant material was immunogenic in mice, and elicited systemic antigen-specific IgG: this augurs well for similar experiments in larger animals. A spur to the deployment of human vaccines for RVFV could be the recent finding that the virus may be involved in human miscarriages in South Sudan. 38 Our laboratory is in the process of testing transiently-expressed RVFV N protein for its suitability as a diagnostic reagent, similar to the CCHFV case described above.
West Nile flavivirus (WNV)a mosquito-transmitted pathogen in the same family as Zika, yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis virusesis also of concern to One Health, given its recent intercontinental transmission from Europe to the Americas and the fact that the virus is transmitted regularly to livestock and to humans, and can cause severe disease. 39 A potentially useful vaccine candidate consisting of the domain III of the E glycoprotein was produced by ER-targetted transient expression in N benthamiana at levels of 73 mg/kg, and was easily purified, bound MAbs recognizing a conformational epitope of the native protein, and elicited a potent systemic immune response after subcutaneous immunization in mice. 40 Other work from the same group provided evidence that a humanised mAb to WNV E protein (E16) could be produced in N benthamiana by transient agroinfiltration-mediated expression, and that it protected mice against WNV-induced mortality comparably to mammalian-celL-produced E16 MAbs. 41 Later work demonstrated that both the WNV domain III (DIII) protein and the E16 mAb could be rapidly produced at high levels in plants and easily purified, and that they could be used to identify WNV, and detect human IgM responses to WNV infection, in serological assays. 42 The fact that E16 mAb does not cross-react with other flaviviruses makes it useful as a diagnostic, but also potentially useful in therapy, as it is not likely to cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection by other related flaviviruses such as yellow fever, Zika and dengue viruses.
Dengue viruses (DENV) are a problematic vaccine target, given that antibodies directed against any one of the 4 dengue subtypes will not protect against infection by any of the others, and may in fact result in ADE of infection by them, which can result in dengue hemorrhagic fever. While there is now a licensed quadrivalent live vaccine, 43 new concerns over the interaction of dengue and other flaviviruses and in particular Zika virus, and the possibility of reciprocal ADE between them, have prompted caution over its use. For this reason, subunit vaccines consisting of E protein DIIIsimilar to the WNV example above, and which are serotype-specific and elicit neutralising antibodies which are not involved in ADEhave been trialled in monkeys, with good efficacy shown: 44 however, as with any other protein vaccine, production will probably be expensive. A group based in Korea has accordingly explored a variety of options of producing DIII-derived vaccines in plants, including fusion of a DIII with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and production in transgenic tobacco; 45 fusing a consensus DIII, which elicits neutralising antibodies against all 4 dengue virus serotypes, to M cell-targeting peptide ligand (Co1), producing it in transgenic rice calli and showing it was targeted to the mucosal immune system in mice; 46 and modifying the recombinant immune complexes (RIC) shown to work for Zaire ebolavirus GP1 by fusing the Ebola GP1 epitope binding the 6D8 mAb to the dengue virus consensus DIII domain, and then to the mAb, and producing it transiently in tobacco. 47 The purified hybrid dengue-Ebola RIC (DERIC) bound C1q, and elicited potent virus-neutralising Abs in mice without the use of adjuvants. Another group used transplastomic tobacco to produce the 4 serotype DIII proteins to moderate yield, without testing their immunogenicity. 48 This work shows that it is possible to produce candidate dengue subunit vaccines in plants that are at least the equivalent of conventionally-produced candidates.
A potentially therapeutic product for treatment of dengue infections is the mAb E60, which neutralizes all 4 serotypes of the virus: 49 a problem with production in mammalian cells, however, is that the mAb exhibits ADE, meaning treated animals are more susceptible to severe disease if infected with another serotype. Production of the mAb by agroinfiltrationmediated transient expression in N benthamiana, however, abrogated ADE activity without affecting antigen binding and neutralisation efficiency against DENV serotypes 2 and 4, presumably due to the different N-glycosylation pattern compared with the conventional mAb. This property could be exploited for other therapeutic MAbs, where modulation or reduction of Fc-mediated functions may be advantageous.
The live attenuated 17D yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine has been both efficacious and regarded as safe since the 1930s, and is credited with saving possibly millions of lives. However, it is produced in eggs -meaning individuals with egg allergies may not safely receive the vaccine. There are other rare but serious risks for some, such as neurologic effects and organ failure. It is recommended that children under 6 months, the elderly and the immunocompromised, and pregnant or breastfeeding women should not receive the vaccine. 50 There are also concerns that, as with immunity to dengue, reactions to Zika virus infection could be exacerbated by prior immunity to YFV. While the existence of a live, monotypic, lifelong and highly successful vaccine has probably dampened most researchers' enthusiasm for researching a subunit alternative, it is interesting that the molecular farming contract manufacturer iBio Inc. has a collaboration with Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos of Brazil, to use their proprietary technology to manufacture a plant-made YFV vaccine. 51 
The technology we know as molecular farming has truly come of age recently: there are many products with proofs of efficacy in animal models, especially for veterinary use (for review of virus vaccines, see ref. 9 ); however, there are proofs of principle for both animal and human products, and licensing for use in humans of therapeutic products including ZMapp TM and Elelyso, an enzyme replacement therapy for the glucocerebrosidase deficit that causes Gaucher's disease in humans.
I feel that it is in the sphere of interests of One Health, though, that molecular farming could truly make an immediate impact: the application of plant-made proteins as inexpensive reagents could revolutionise point-of-care diagnostics, for example; use of farmed vaccines that could be the same proteins used in diagnostics could also make universal vaccination of livestock against certain diseases a reality. Where there are vaccines for animals but these are not safe for humans, such as in the case of RVFV and CCHFV, plant-made subunit vaccines may safely bridge the human-animal divide. Plant-made influenzavirus A vaccines, whether type-specific or universal, could soon be a realityand may make vaccination of swine and poultry a much easier and cheaper and safer prospect. Rabies vaccines and especially therapeutics would be a most worthy target, given that most animal and human victims of the disease are in developing countries. It is also possible that molecular farming could allow more routine application of therapeutics in veterinary medicine, given the low cost of goods and the potential for oral dosing.
This brief review has hopefully illustrated both the existing arsenal of plant-made vaccines and reagents suitable for use in a One Health context, and also the potential of plants and plant cell systems to be used for other pathogens for these purposes.

Recent work identified memory-like CXCR5 + TCF1 + CD8 + T cells that sustain T cell responses during persistent infection and proliferate upon anti-PD1 treatment. Approaches to expand these cells are sought. We show that blockade of interferon type 1 (IFN-I) receptor leads to CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion in an IL-27-and STAT1-dependent manner. IFNAR1 blockade promoted accelerated cell division and retention of TCF1 in virus-specific CD8 + T cells. We found that CD8 + T cell-intrinsic IL-27 signaling safeguards the ability of TCF1 hi cells to maintain proliferation and avoid terminal differentiation or programmed cell death. Mechanistically, IL-27 endowed rapidly dividing cells with IRF1, a transcription factor that was required for sustained division in a cell-intrinsic manner.

SHIP has previously been shown to play a pivotal role in limiting the number of immunoregulatory cells and their function. Aim To determine whether SHIP plays a pivotal role in control of immune tolerance in the gut mucosa. Methods Gastrointestinal pathology was assessed in three separate strains of SHIP-deficient mice and their respective wild-type (WT) littermates. Gastrointestinal pathology was analysed in SHIP-deficient hosts reconstituted with WT haematopoietic cell grafts, and WT hosts reconstituted with SHIP-deficient haematopoietic cell grafts including whole splenocytes, purified T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Major immune cell populations were also analysed in the small intestine of SHIP-deficient mice and WT controls. Results SHIP-deficient mice developed segmental, transmural pyo-granulomatous ilietis that recapitulated classical features of Crohn's disease enteric pathology. Analysis of haematopoietic chimeras showed that WT bone marrow reconstitution of SHIP À/À hosts corrects ileitis. Reconstitution with SHIP À/À splenocytes transferred ileitis to WT hosts. Adoptive transfer of purified SHIP À/À T cells or NK cells to WT hosts did not transfer ileitis. There was a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestines of SHIP-deficient mice; however, neutrophil numbers were significantly increased.
Conclusions SHIP plays a pivotal role in immune function in the intestine; further scrutiny of this pathway in IBD patients is warranted. It is proposed that SHIP-deficient ileitis results from a local deficit in mucosal T cell immunity that promotes a damaging granulocyteemonocyte inflammation of the distal ileum.","Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect various sites within the gastrointestinal tract, but classically the ileum, which leads to abdominal cramping, diarrhoea and gastrointestinal bleeding. 1e4 CD histopathological lesions begin with the formation of multiple aphthoid ulcers infiltrated by neutrophils, which progress and coalesce into sharply delimited, regional, transmural inflammations with granuloma formation, thickening of the muscularis propria, strictures, fissures and fistulas. 1e4 Although genome-wide association studies have identified more than 30 susceptibility loci for IBD that disturb either intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier homeostasis or immune effector cell functions and interactions with luminal flora and antigens, 5e7 many susceptibility genes possess differing functions in IEC and haematopoietic cells, and primary IEC or immunological defects in genetically susceptible individuals often remain enigmatic. 8 9 Primary immunological alterations proposed to contribute to the development of CD pathology include increased expression of Th1-polarising cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon g by cells in the lamina propria, 10 11 aberrant IL-23initiated Th17-associated immune responses, 12 13 defects in regulatory T cell (Treg) modulation of effector functions via transforming growth factor b or IL-10 dependent mechanisms, 14 aberrant B-cell specificity and serum autoreactivity 15 and myeloid cell dysfunction. 16 That primary defects in immune cell function contribute to CD in some patients is supported by reports of disease remission following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. 17 This paper is freely available online under the BMJ Journals unlocked scheme, see http:// gut.bmj.com/site/about/ unlocked.xhtml
What is already known about this subject? < Immune regulation is critical for the integrity and function of the small intestine. < SHIP controls the homeostasis of immunoregulatory myeloid and T lymphoid cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues such as spleen and lymph node. < Myeloid consolidation of the lungs is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in SHIPdeficient mice.
What are the new findings?
< Despite enhanced immune regulation in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of SHIP-deficient mice, immune function and regulation is compromised in the small intestine of these mice. < Normal immune function and homeostasis in the small intestine requires enzymatically active SHIP. < Expression of SHIP by intestinal epithelial cells is not required for the integrity of the small intestine. < SHIP-deficient haematolymphoid cells are sufficient to transfer ileitis to wild-type hosts. < There is a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestine of SHIP-deficient mice. < There is local neutrophilia in the small intestines of SHIP-deficient mice.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
< These findings suggest that detailed analysis of the SHIP gene is warranted in human IBD patients and may also lead to a better understanding of immune cell signalling pathways required for immune function and regulation in the human gut.
IEC barrier defects that may contribute to CD development include the inability of a Paneth cell-derived NOD2 variant to  expel luminal bacteria, 18 diminished IEC autophagy and antimicrobial granule exocytosis, 19 altered IEC toll-like receptor expression with potentially dysregulated responses to common bacterial  motifs, 20 altered IEC cytokine expression 21 and increased IEC paracellular permeability to enteric luminal contents, perhaps due to inadequate formation of IEC tight junctions. 22 Although animal models of IBD have been described, most model systems affect the large intestine, do not manifest CD-specific histopathological features, and are often induced rather than spontaneously developing models. 5 7 23 Only two animal models spontaneously develop chronic inflammation of the ileum, the SAMP1/Yit mouse 24 and the TNF ΔARE mouse. 25 SAMP1/Yit mice spontaneously develop terminal ileitis by 10 weeks of age driven by Th1-and Th2-type immune responses, the severity of which can be decreased by antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies. 23 26 27 Although SAMP1/Yit mesenteric lymph node CD4 + T cells are capable of adoptively transferring ileitis to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, increased IEC paracellular permeability appears to be the primary susceptibility factor in this model. 22 The TNF ΔARE mouse model was generated by deletion of 69bp within the AU-rich region (ARE) of the gene that encodes TNF, resulting in increased systemic TNF levels associated with expansion of CD8 + effector cell subpopulations that mediate chronic ileitis and arthritis in both heterozygous and homozygous mice. 25 28 Haematopoietic cells of neither the SAMP1/Yit nor the TNF ΔARE mouse are capable of adoptively transferring CD-like disease to an immunocompetent host.
The Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP) protein becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in haematopoietic cells following activation of surface receptors for various cytokines including erythropoietin, IL-3, GM-CSF, M-CSF, or in response to B cell antigen receptor cross-linking, or T cell activation. 29 30 SHIP signalling plays a pivotal role in limiting the number and function of immunoregulatory cells in the peripheral lymphoid system. 31e37 We recently found that SHIP limits the number of immunoregulatory T cells present in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. 35 SHIP performs this role by controlling the number of Treg cells in the periphery either by limiting the survival of FoxP3 + Treg cells or by preventing the inappropriate acquisition of FoxP3 expression by naïve CD4 T cells. 35 Consistent with this finding, the p110 subunit of an enzyme that SHIP opposes, PI3K, is critical for the formation and survival of Treg cells in the periphery. 38 39 SHIP-deficiency also promotes the inappropriate expansion of myeloid immunoregulatory (MIR) cells in spleen and lymph nodes. 32 33 Thus, in major peripheral lymphoid tissues like spleen and lymph node, SHIP-deficiency leads to profound and functional expansion of immunoregulatory capacity. In aggregate these studies establish that inositol phospholipid signalling plays a pivotal role in the formation, homeostasis and function of both myeloid and lymphoid immunoregulatory cell populations. SHIP, through its 5 9 -inositol phosphatase domain, hydrolyses the second messenger PI(3,4,5)P 3 and thus limits PI3K activation of key downstream immune effector pathways such as Akt and NF-kB. 30 40 SHIP-deficient mice are smaller than their WT and heterozygous littermates and exhibit a greatly reduced lifespan with survival beyond 10e12 weeks of life observed only rarely, 32 41 attributable in part to the development of an eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia with infiltration by mixed inflammatory cells resulting in patchy lung consolidation. 41 Eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia is a cause of shortened life span in various genetically engineered mouse models. 42 43 Granulocytes are less susceptible to apoptotic signals in SHIP-deficient mice, and granulocyteemonocyte infiltrations can be found in the liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas lymph nodes and thymus. 44 The increased capacity of SHIP-deficient T cells to differentiate into Treg cells is accompanied by a deficiency in Th17 cell differentiation and a reduced ability to cause colitis after adoptive transfer of CD4 + T cells to T cell deficient hosts. 35 36 Although SHIP expression and function has generally been thought to be confined to cells in the haematopoietic system, recent evidence indicates that SHIP is also expressed by some parenchymal cell types, including osteoblasts 45 and endothelial cells. 46 In fact, we recently identified the first known function for SHIP outside the haematolymphoid compartment as SHIP is required for support of haematopoietic stem cell function and quiescence by bone marrow (BM) niche cells. 45 Given its role in immune regulation and lymphoid function we sought to examine whether SHIP-deficiency might have consequences at enteric mucosal surfaces where greater stress is placed on both immune effector and regulatory processes due to the close and constant interaction with commensal microflora and potential pathogens at this organ site. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestine with a concomitant increase in neutrophils at this site. Consistent with altered immune status we find spontaneous development of ileitis with features that closely recapitulate those of CD pathology. In addition, the susceptibility factor for this CD-like ileitis of SHIP-deficient mice appears to be in the haematopoietic compartment, and likely granulocytee monocyte, as the CD-like ileitis was transferable to an immunocompetent host following irradiation and reconstitution with SHIP splenocytes, but not following transfer of either T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Consequently, the SHIP-deficient mouse is the first CD animal model capable of adoptively transferring CD-like disease to an immunocompetent host.
The development and production of SHIP À/À mice has been described previously. In brief SHIP À/À mice were generated by deletion of the promoter and first exon of SHIP via a Cre-LoxP strategy and then backcrossed to the C57BL6/J background. SHIP DIP/DIP mice were a kind gift of Dr Jeffery Ravetch (Rockefeller University, New York). 47 MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice were described previously. 33 SHIP expression is ablated in these mice following three intraperitoneal injections of polyI/C at 625m/ dose. MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice were sacrificed for tissue harvest 4e5 weeks after the last polyI/C injection. The PI3K haploinsufficient SHIP À/À mice analysed in this study possess a mutation in the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K 48 and a SHIP mutation created by Helgason et al. 41 All mice were between 6 and 13 weeks of age at time of sacrifice. All mice were maintained in an accredited, barrier facility confirmed free of a comprehensive list of potential parasites and microbial pathogens including Citrobacter rodentium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., and Clostridium perfringens, Adoptive transfer experiments BM cells were flushed from intact femur and tibia and collected in tissue media (TM) consisting of RPMI, 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). Spleens were crushed with a 10 ml syringe plunger. The single cell suspension was then filtered through a 70 mm strainer (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) and red blood cell (RBC) lysis performed at room temperature for 5 min in 13 RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, California, USA). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 13 Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS). C57BL/6 recipients were given antibiotic water prior to receiving a split dose of 1100 Rads (600+500) from an x-ray irradiator. Irradiated recipients were then transplanted with 5310 5 BM cells or splenocytes as indicated via retro-orbital injection. For adoptive transfer of T and NK cells, CD3 + NKp46 À T and NKp46 + CD3 À NK cells were simultaneously sorted from spleens of SHIP À/À mice and adoptively transferred into irradiated C57BL6 hosts (550 Rads) via retro-orbital injection. Each C57BL/6 host received 2.4310 5 SHIP À/À T cells and 7.5310 3 SHIP À/À NK cells.
Necropsies were performed in a systematic, comprehensive manner. The entire alimentary tract, including the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and colon and associated mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes was evaluated, and the alimentary tract was insufflated with 10% neutralbuffered formalin and rolled in segments to fit as Swiss rolls into cassettes for histological processing and microscopic evaluation. The skin, subcutis, skeletal muscle, inguinal lymph node and mammary fat pad, cervical lymph node, salivary glands, reproductive tract and associated glands, liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys and adrenal glands, were evaluated. The larynx, trachea with attached thyroid and parathyroid glands, heart, thymus, and lungs insufflated with 10% neutral-buffered formalin were collected. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutralbuffered formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 3 mm and stained with H&E. Histological sections of each segment of the alimentary tract were masked, assessed and assigned an inflammatory grade of 0e6, with grade 6 representing the most progressed, severe lesion. Inflammatory grades assigned were as follows: inflammatory grade 0¼no significant abnormalities; inflammatory grade 1¼mild predominantly polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocyte infiltrations (<25 PMN/ hpf) of the lamina propria and/or enteric lymph nodule; inflammatory grade 2¼moderate predominantly PMN leucocyte infiltrations (>25 cells/hpf) of the lamina propria and/or lymph nodule; inflammatory grade 3¼marked inflammatory cell infiltrations with extension below the muscularis mucosa causing architectural distortion of the mucosa and submucosa with attendant crypt hyperplasia; inflammatory grade 4¼marked infiltrations with extension into the tunica muscularis; inflammatory grade 5¼marked transmural leucocyte infiltrations; inflammatory grade 6¼marked transmural leucocyte infiltrations with extension into the mesentery and/or other organs. In each section the presence of granuloma, crypt abscess, stricture, fissure, and whether dissemination of inflammation to other sites had occurred was noted. Inflammatory scores were compared between cohorts by one-way ANOVA. All reported p-values are two-sided with p<0.01 considered significant. The sections were scored by a single, board certified veterinary pathologist. The sections were scored by a veterinary pathologist with confirmation of scoring system and subsequent gradations by a clinical pathologist.
The antibodies used for staining of cells prepared from small intestines included CD33, CD4, CD8, CD16/32, CD62L, CD62E and Ly6G and were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, California, USA). Samples were acquired on a FACSCalibur and analysed using FlowJo8. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis following cytometer acquisition of staining data based on exclusion of the DAPI dye.
Seventy-nine 6e8 week old mice, including 26 SHIP À/À mice, 26 SHIP DIP/DIP mice, one PI3K +/À SHIP À/À and 26 wild type littermates, each of both sexes were submitted to systematic, comprehensive necropsies, with histopathological examination of the entire insufflated alimentary tract. Primary gastrointestinal lesions were present only within the ileum of SHIP-deficient mice, and consisted of a segmental ileitis. Lesions were graded according to the extent of inflammation as grade 0e6 (figures 1e6). Of the 53 SHIP-deficient mice evaluated, only 3 of the 53 (6%) of SHIP-deficient mice lacked ileitis, while 50 of the 53 (94%) of SHIP-deficient mice had some degree of ileitis, significantly more than the absence of ileitis in WT littermates (p<0.001). Both SHIP À/À and SHIP DIP/DIP that harbour deletions in exons encoding different regions in the SHIP1 locus developed ileitis with comparable frequency with 25 of 26 (96%) of SHIP À/À mice, and 24 of 26 (92%) of SHIP DIP/DIP mice affected with comparable mean ileitis inflammatory grades of 4.262.1 and 4.062.2, respectively. Ileitis was also observed in a PI3K +/À SHIP À/À mouse (grade 4), indicating that a third independent SHIP mutant strain develops this pathology and that PI3K haploinsufficiency does not protect from development of ileitis. PI3K +/À SHIP +/+ and PI3K +/À SHIP +/À controls showed no evidence of ileitis (grade 0). Inflammatory lesions of the ileum in all SHIP-deficient mice analysed were present on a background of otherwise unaffected, uninflamed gastrointestinal tract.
The earliest manifestation of CD-like ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice, assigned grade 1, consisted of a mild (<25 PMN/hpf), predominantly PMN leucocyte infiltration of the lamina propria and frequently underlying lymph nodule (figure 1). The ileum of 9 of the 53 (17%) of the SHIP-deficient mice had grade 1 lesions. This mild, earliest lesion of the SHIP-deficient ileum had progressed in other individual SHIP À/À and SHIP DIP/DIP mice to a moderate (>25 PMN/hpf), mixed, but still predominantly PMN leucocyte infiltration of the expanded lamina propria and underlying lymph nodule, assigned grade 2, with attendant crypt regenerative hyperplasia manifest as IEC crowding, and elongation of crypt depth (figure 2). Grade 2 ileitis was present in 2 of the 53 (4%) of SHIP-deficient mice. Grade 3 inflammatory cell infiltrations were mixed and penetrated below the muscularis mucosa with distortion of villous architecture by the expanded mucosa and submucosa, and attendant crypt hyperplasia ( figure 3) . Five of the 53 (9%) of SHIP-deficient mice had grade 3 inflammatory lesions within the ileum.
Marked, mixed inflammatory cell infiltrations of the ileum of SHIP-deficient mice extending from the mucosa, submucosa, and into the tunica muscularis were assigned grade 4 ( figure 4) . Six of the 53 (11%) of SHIP-deficient mice had grade 4 inflammatory lesions within the ileum. Composition of grade 4 inflammation varied from predominantly PMN in some segments to predominantly mononuclear in others, often as a mix of granulocytes, lymphocytes, histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells ( figure 4D,E) . Inflammatory cell infiltrations that extended into the tunica muscularis were segmental, sharply delimited, and arranged either randomly or as rows of aggregates in rosarybead arrays (figure 4F). In some areas of grade 4 inflammation the overlying mucosa was focally ulcerated. Granulomas and pyo-granulomas were present in the mucosa, submucosa and/or tunica muscularis. Thickening of the bowel wall due to grade 4 inflammation resulted in lumen narrowing and stricture formation in some mice ( figure 4G) .
Marked, mixed inflammatory cell infiltrations that extended transmural, deep into the bowel wall to the serosa, assigned grade 5 (figure 5), were present in 5 of the 53 (9%) of SHIPdeficient mice. In some cases, grade 5 ileitis thickened the bowel wall, narrowed the lumen, led to stricture formation and the development of fissures that penetrated into and ended blindly within the tunica muscularis ( figure 5A,B) .
SHIP-deficient mice with marked, mixed, transmural inflammatory cell infiltrations of the ileum that extended by way of fissures through the thickened tunica muscularis and serosa into the mesentery (figure 6AeC) were assigned grade 6. More SHIPdeficient mice were assigned inflammatory grade 6 than any other grade with 23 of the 53 (43%) of SHIP-deficient mice assigned ileitis grade 6. Inflammation extending into the mesentery consisted of mixed inflammatory cells, granuloma, fibrosis, and rarely thrombosis and vasculitis (figure 6DeF).
Ileitis of SHIP-deficient mice of all grades 1e6 was segmental, presenting either as focal, discontinuous inflammatory cell infiltrations or as broad bands of inflammation within the ileum (figure 7AeC). Neighbouring segments of ileum and those of more proximal small intestine or distal large intestine were unaffected. Strictures were observed in 12 of 53 (23%) of SHIPdeficient mice (figure 4G), granuloma were present in 15 of 53 (28%) (figure 4I), and crypt abscesses were observed in 5 of 53 (9%) of SHIP-deficient mice (figure 4J). Pyloric metaplasia of the ileum, and fistula formation, other characteristics of CD histopathology in humans, were not evident in SHIP-deficient mice.
Rarely, ileitis spread by direct extension to other gastrointestinal sites, including in two mice where inflammation of the ileum extended via the mesentery to the colon wall ( figure 8A,B) , and in a third SHIP-deficient mouse where inflammation had spread to the gastro-oesophageal juncture ( figure 8C,D) . Draining mesenteric lymph nodes were often enlarged and inflamed in 33 of 53 (62%) of SHIP-deficient mice ( figure 8E,F ). An individual SHIP À/À mouse had inflammatory cellular thrombi in mesenteric veins and a granulomatous pulmonary consolidation comparable in composition to the ileitis in this case, suggesting that vascular thrombi and emboli may rarely develop as a consequence of CD-like ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice and may disseminate inflammation via haematogenous routes (figure 8GeJ). This pulmonary consolidation was distinct from that which occurs routinely in SHIP À/À and SHIP DIPDIP mice as an eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia (figure 9AeF). 
The above studies show that ileitis occurs in germline SHIP mutant mice, indicating this CD-like pathology may have a developmental origin. To test this possibility we analysed intestinal pathology in MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice where SHIP expression is normal in fetal, neonatal and adolescent life, but can be ablated during adulthood following polyI/C administration. 33 This approach results in eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia in adult mice rendered SHIP deficient. 49 For this analysis twelve 6e8 week old MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice and twelve SHIP flox/flox controls, each of both sexes were submitted to comparable histopathological analyses. Primary gastrointestinal lesions were present only within the ileum of MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice, while SHIP flox/flox mice were unaffected 4e5 weeks after the last injection of polyI/C. Of the 12 MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice evaluated, only 1 (8%) lacked ileitis, while 11 of 12 (92%) developed ileitis with a mean inflammatory grade of 3.561.9. Comparable to ileitis of SHIP À/À and SHIP DIP/DIP mice, ileitis of MxCre SHIP flox/flox mice was segmental in nature with mixed inflammatory cell infiltrations. Granuloma formation was evident in 2 of 12 (17%) of MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice. Thus, CD-like ileitis develops with selective deletion in adult mice, illustrating that SHIP expression is required to maintain normal mucosal immune homeostasis and regulation in the adult ileum.
To assess the possibility that SHIP-deficiency might alter the development or function of parenchymal cell types in the ileum such as the IEC, we created bone marrow (BM) chimeras where six SHIP À/À hosts were reconstituted with WT C57BL/6 BM and analysed histopathologically 4 months post-transplantation. The gastrointestinal tract of the six SHIP À/À hosts reconstituted with WT BM lacked any abnormalities including all features of the CD-like ileitis observed in germline SHIP À/À and SHIP DIP/DIP mice. We also analysed the lungs of these reconstituted mice. Although components of a moderate eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia were present in the SHIP À/À hosts reconstituted with WT C57BL/6 BM, including crystal formation, and an increase in the number of alveolar macrophages, the marked myeloid infiltration and pulmonary consolidation observed in SHIP À/À and SHIP DIP/DIP mice was not present in lungs of SHIP À/À hosts reconstituted with WT C57BL/6 BM.
To directly test whether SHIP-deficient haematolymphoid cells are responsible for the ileitis observed in SHIP-deficient strains, we adoptively transferred 5310 5 SHIP À/À splenocytes to each of six WT C57BL/6 hosts. The lungs and intestines were then analysed 1 month later for evidence of pathology. Segmental ileitis similar to that observed in germline SHIP-deficient mice was present in 5 of 6 WT mice that received SHIP À/À splenocytes with a mean ileitis score of 1.8 (the range of scores was 0e5). This analysis demonstrates that SHIP-deficiency of the haematolymphoid compartment is sufficient to alter enteric immune cell homeostatic responses in the small intestine resulting in a CD-like phenotype. Interestingly, adoptive transfer Figure 4 Grade 4 Crohn's disease-like ileitis of SHIP-deficient mice was comprised of a marked, mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the ileum extending through the mucosa, submucosa, and into the tunica muscularis (A, B, C, F, G) . Such inflammatory cell infiltrations varied in composition, were in some areas of affected ileum predominantly polymorphonuclear (D), while in other areas were predominantly mononuclear with lymphocytes, histiocytes and numerous multi-nucleated giant cells present (B, E). Grade 4 ileitis was typically sharply delimited aggregates of pyo-granulomatous inflammatory cell infiltrations, at times in rosary-bead arrays (F, arrows), that caused thickening of the bowel wall (G, arrows) and lumen narrowing. Multinucleated giant cells (H), and pyo-granulomas (I) were frequently present in affected segments, but crypt abscesses (J, arrow) were less frequently observed. of FACS-purified CD3 + T cells, NK1.1 + CD3 À NK cells prepared from the spleens of SHIP À/À mice was unable to transfer any detectable ileitis to WT hosts (three hosts analysed per cell type). Thus, SHIP-deficient T cells or NK cells are sufficient for transfer of ileitis. We also observed that SHIP À/À splenocytes transfer a mild to moderate eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia to WT hosts with progression to patchy pulmonary consolidation in some cases as is observed in both germline SHIPdeficient mice 41 and MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice following gene ablation. 49 Neutrophilia combined with T cell paucity in the SHIP-deficient small intestine Our pathology findings and adoptive transfer studies described above suggest that a granulocyteemonocyte lineage cell may underlie the ileitis that we observe in SHIP-deficient mice. To further evaluate this possibility, we conducted multi-parametric cytometry assays of major immune cell populations including neutrophils, dendritic cells, CD4/CD8 T cells and Treg cells present in small intestines of SHIP-deficient and WT mice. In support of a role for neutrophils in ileitis, we find there is an absolute increase in total number of neutrophils present in the small intestine of SHIP À/À mice ( figure 10 ). This applied to neutrophils of the Ly6G + CD16/32 + phenotype as well as the CD62L + subset ( figure 10 A,B) . These findings of ileal neutrophilia are consistent with our histopathology studies described above. Surprisingly, we find a profound reduction in the number of both CD4 (figure 11A) and CD8 (figure 11B) T cells present in SHIP-deficient small intestines. When paired with the T cell adoptive transfer studies described above, these findings suggest that the CD-like ileitis observed in SHIP-deficient mice is not attributable to an autoimmune attack by SHIPdeficient T cells. Analysis of CD11c + CD11b + mature dendritic cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells did not show a significant difference in the numbers of these immune cells between SHIP À/À and WT small intestines.
CD pathology begins with the formation of multiple aphthoid ulcers infiltrated by neutrophils, which progress and coalesce into sharply delimited, regional, transmural inflammations with formation of strictures, fissures and fistulas. 1e4 Here we show that mutation of the SHIP1 locus leads to a comparable ileitis dominated by neutrophils. Although elements of CD pathology are lacking in the SHIP-deficient mouse described herein, including development of multiple aphthoid ulcers, pyloric gland metaplasia, granulation tissue, and fistula formation, many CD histopathological features are present. SHIP-deficient ileitis is not precipitated by an apparent dysfunction on the part of SHIPdeficient parenchymal elements as reconstitution of SHIP À/À hosts with SHIP-competent haematolymphoid cells prevents development of ileitis. However, these same hosts still retain some facets of eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia indicating that SHIP À/À parenchymal elements may contribute to the lung pathology found in germline SHIP-deficient mice. Conversely, we find that transfer of SHIP-deficient haematolymphoid cells from the spleen is sufficient to trigger CD-like ileitis in an immunocompetent host. Transfer of cells capable of a cellmediated immune attack, T cells and NK cells, do not elicit this CD-like ileitis. These findings suggest that a SHIP-deficient myeloid cell may promote the CD-like enteritis that occurs in SHIP-deficient mice. Granulocytes are less susceptible to apoptotic signals in SHIP-deficient mice, granulocyteemonocyte infiltrations can be found in various tissues of SHIP-deficient mice, 44 and mononuclear phagocytes are essential for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. 50 Retention of components of eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia in the SHIP À/À hosts reconstituted with WT BM indicates that aspects of this lung pathology are of a parenchymal, cell autonomous origin. Mass spectrometry analyses have identified Ym1 as the principal crystalline protein of this pneumonia, perhaps secreted by activated alveolar macrophages, and proposed to be involved in eosinophil recruitment, immune activation and tissue repair. 34 However, since SHIP-deficient mice that undergo allogeneic BM transplant have a normal lifespan, 32 these retained features of pulmonary pathology are apparently not sufficient to progress to the fatal lung consolidation that occurs in germline, SHIP-deficient mice. 41 Further, with the present observations, CD-like enteritis should be included among the pathologies that develop and contribute to morbidity and mortality in germline, SHIP-deficient mice.
The absence of enteric pathology in SHIP À/À hosts reconstituted with WT BM indicates that SHIP-deficiency does not cause an IEC functional barrier defect leading to ileitis. Conversely, that the CD-like phenotype can be transferred to an immunocompetent host by SHIP-deficient haematopoietic cells suggests that SHIP-deficient ileitis is due to an alteration in the regulation of innate immune functions (eg, granulocytee monocyte responses), a failure of T cell mediated mucosal barrier functions or a combination of such potential alterations. Ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice may result from a deficit in mucosal T cell function that permits inappropriate granulocyteemonocyte responses to commensal organisms and luminal antigens culminating in the inflamed states observed in the ileum of SHIP-deficient mice.
Although the SAMP1/Yit mouse 24 and the TNF ΔARE mouse 25 spontaneously develop ileitis, the present SHIP-deficient mouse is unique in that it recapitulates the CD phenotype apparently through perturbation of immune cell populations that can be transferred to a WT host. There are a number of possible candidates for the enteritis-inducing cell. Because we observed neutrophilic infiltrates in the distal ileum lamina propria of most SHIP-deficient mice, we speculate that inappropriate responses by neutrophils to commensal microflora in the lumen of the ileum may underlie or trigger the immune attack. SHIP plays a pivotal role in preventing neutrophilia, as granulocyte numbers in peripheral blood are profoundly increased in SHIP À/À mice 41 as well as mice treated with a SHIP1 selective inhibitor, 3AC. 49 Inappropriate effector function by SHIP À/À neutrophils at organ sites has not been examined to date, and thus our findings represent the first indication of neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in SHIP-deficient hosts. Conversely, it seems unlikely that the enteritis results from inappropriate T cell attack in the small intestine, as SHIP-deficiency causes a profound local deficit in both CD4 and CD8 T cell numbers in the small intestine, while normal numbers of Treg cells are still present at this site.
The CD-like pathological findings described above are routinely observed in the ileum of both SHIP À/À strains 31 41 and the SHIP DIPDIP strain 47 that harbour different mutations of the SHIP1 gene indicating this is a highly penetrant phenotype. Moreover, because the phenotype occurs in the SHIP DIPDIP strain where only the inositol phosphatase domain encoding exons of SHIP are excised, we conclude that the phenotype is dependent on loss of SHIP enzymatic activity. SHIP through its 5 9 -inositol phosphatase domain hydrolyses the second messenger PI(3,4,5)P 3 and thus limits PI3K activation of key downstream survival and effector pathways promoted by Akt and NF-kB. 30 40 However, recent findings indicate that SHIP, via generation of PI(3,4)P 2 , can also promote cellular survival by increasing activation of Akt, 49 consistent with the demonstration that Akt binds to and is more effectively activated by the SHIP product, PI(3,4)P 2 , than by its substrate, PI(3,4,5)P 3 . 51 Tiwari et al found that SHIP can also promote immune effector function via synthesis of PI(3,4)P ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 . 52 It remains to be determined whether SHIP-deficiency is causing ileitis due to a lack of inhibitory or activating signalling in immune cells. This may be dependent on cellular context. For instance, one could envision that SHIP may be required for efficient mucosal trafficking and survival of T cells via generation of PI(3,4)P 2 , but by decreasing PI(3,4,5)P 3 in neutrophils SHIP is also limiting their numbers and function at this enteric site. Future lineage specific SHIP ablation studies using SHIP flox/flox mice and appropriate Cre transgenes combined with biochemical analysis PI3K effector pathways in these models may elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying SHIP's role in preserving normal immune function/regulation in the ileum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Genetic analysis of mice and genome wide association studies have led to the identification of mutations that can predispose to CD with varying probability of incidence and timing of onset. Our analysis suggests that in the laboratory mouse, SHIP is a strong genetic determinant of CD-like pathology, suggesting that a similar situation may also be revealed by close examination of SHIP expression and function in CD patients. Tantalising evidence for a role of SHIP1 in human IBD is suggested by the recent demonstration that a chromosome 2 polymorphism located at 2q37 is associated with a significantly increased and early onset of IBD. 53 The SHIP1 locus is also found in the 2q37 region of human chromosome 2. This potential association merits comparison of SHIP enzymatic activity in IBD patients and normal controls using a recently developed fluorogenic assay that measures SHIP1 activity. 49 Future investigations of cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice may also provide insights into how immunological alterations contribute to IBD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific antibodies against significant pathogens were not increased in paired sera, so we diagnosed her with primary human bocavirus pneumonia.","Human bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging pathogen for which sequences were identified in 2005 by molecular screening in respiratory samples of Swedish children with lower respiratory tract infections (1) . HBoV is distributed worldwide and has been identified in every country that has tested for it. HBoV infections do not appear to be common in normal adults with respiratory illnesses but are mainly reported in immunocompromised individuals (2, 3) .
We herein report a fatal case of primary HBoV pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult and discuss HBoV.
A 70-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital with severe respiratory failure and a fever in June 2018. She had developed general fatigue two weeks earlier and was admitted to another hospital nine days before transfer to our hospital. Chest X-ray and computed tomography at that hospital showed consolidation in the right lung field (Fig. 1) , whereas her left lung was clear. Sputum and blood cultures did not yield significant pathogens. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with levofloxacin plus ampicillin/sulbactam, but her condition continued to worsen, and she was transferred to our hospital.
She had a history of atrioseptal defect for which she had received surgery at 20 years of age, but she had received no drugs until she developed her initial symptoms. She had never experienced repeated episodes of infection that would be suggestive of immunodeficiency. She had never smoked or drunk, nor had she ever been exposed to significant amounts of dust.
Her vital signs on admission included a blood pressure of 135/78 mmHg, heart rate of 115 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32/min, and body temperature of 37.5 . Her consciousness was clear. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral coarse crackles, and no murmurs were audible. No eruptions or peripheral edema was found. An arterial blood gas analysis under O2 at 10 L/min with a reservoir mask showed the following: pH 7.397, PaCO2 49.8 Torr, PaO2 62.0 Torr, HCO3 − 29.9 mmol/L, and lactate 1.40 mmol/L. Her white blood cell count was 29,700/mm 3 (neutrophils 28,400/mm 3 , eosinophils 0/mm 3 , basophils 100/mm 3 , monocytes 600/mm 3 , and lymphocytes 600/mm 3 Other laboratory data included a serum total protein of 7.2 g/dL, albumin of 1.9 g/ dL, normal liver transaminase, LDH of 177 IU/L, creatine kinase of 82 IU/L, C-reactive protein of 29.4 mg/dL, procalcitonin of 0.830 ng/mL, immunoglobulin (Ig) G of 1,516 mg/dL, IgA of 303 mg/dL, and IgM of 149 mg/dL. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies were both negative. Serum autoimmune antibodies, including anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, were all negative. A rapid influenza test and Mycoplasma antigen test using a nasopharyngeal specimen were negative, as were the urine antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella spp. A beta-D glucan and Aspergillus antigen test were both negative. An anti-HIV antibody was negative. Chest X-ray showed bilateral consolidation with air bronchogram (Fig. 2a) . Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pleural effusion, bilateral consolidation with air bronchogram, and ground-glass opacities in her left lung (Fig. 2b, c) . Left ventricular motion on transthoracic echocardiography was normal with an ejection fraction of 65%.
She was admitted to the intensive-care unit and then intubated for invasive mechanical ventilation. We initially diagnosed her with acute interstitial pneumonia and started levofloxacin 500 mg daily, azithromycin 500 mg daily, and methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days. Prednisolone 40 mg daily was started from hospital day 4, after which her respiratory condition and infiltration on chest X-ray improved (Fig. 3a) . Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) obtained bloody BAL fluid with cell numbers of 1.48×10 3 /mm 3 (macrophages 1.3%, lymphocytes 65.8%, neutrophils 26.8%, and eosinophils 6.2%) but did not show any microorganisms on Gram staining or yield significant pathogens, including M. pneumoniae or Legionella spp. Neither hemosiderinladen macrophages nor atypical cells were found. We performed a multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction using an FTD Resp 21 Kit and FTD Legionella Kit (Fast Track Diagnostics, Silema, Malta), which can detect influenza virus, human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, human metapneumovirus A/B, HBoV, human syncytial virus A/B, human adenovirus, enterovirus, human parechovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila and L. longbeachae, although only HBoV was detected. Repeated blood cultures during admission were all negative. During the convalescent phase, specific antibody titers against M. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydophila pneumoniae, C. psittaci, influenza virus, adenovirus, RSV, and human parainfluenza virus did not increase significantly. We therefore diagnosed her with primary viral pneumonia due to HBoV.
Unfortunately, her respiratory condition and findings of infiltration on chest X-ray worsened, and she stopped responding to further corticosteroid therapy and antibiotics. Her condition deteriorated until her death on hospital day 22 from severe respiratory failure with broad bilateral infiltration noted on chest X-ray (Fig. 3b ).
HBoV is predominantly found in respiratory secretions, and prevalence studies have indicated that it is found primarily in respiratory secretions from children with acute respiratory illnesses, at a rate of 2% to 20% (4). Although found throughout the year, primary HBoV infection predominantly occurs in the winter and spring, as do many other respiratory infections. Evidence accumulated since 2005 supports HBoV as a genuine human pathogen causing mild to severe respiratory tract infections that especially target children (5) . Risk factors for severe HBoV1-associated illnesses include underlying chronic medical conditions, such as cardiac or pulmonary disease, prematurity with chronic lung disease, cancer, and immunosuppression (6); however, our patient had none of these conditions. HBoV is detected in nasopharyngeal specimens in about 0-8.6% of asymptomatic children (7). Our hospital did not detect HBoV from BAL fluid in any of 50 asymptomatic adults (unpublished data), indicating the rarity of HBoV detection in BAL fluid from asymptomatic adults. Another study showed that HBoV DNA is rarely detected in respiratory samples of adult patients over 65 years of age with or without a respiratory tract infection (6) . Other studies have shown HBoV DNA to be common in tonsillar tissue taken from children with hypertrophic tonsils (8) . However, our patient was already intubated when BAL was performed, so the possibility of contamination by viruses colonizing the nasopharyngeal region can be ruled out. Although HBoV infection frequently involves coinfection with other patho-gens (9), our patient had a positive result only for HBoV, and we thus considered her to have primary viral pneumonia.
Several cases of severe, life-threatening, and even fatal respiratory HBoV infection have been reported, most of which were in children. Adult cases include one patient with hematologic malignancy who had severe pneumonia due to HBoV (10) and another with no underlying disease (11) . To our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of fatal HBoV infections in immunocompetent adults.
Chest CT findings of HBoV pneumonia in adults include bilateral consolidation (70.6%) and/or ground-glass opacities (64.7%), but centrilobular nodules are less frequent (14.7%) (12) . These findings were compatible with those of our patient, but they were nonspecific, and we had also initially diagnosed our patient with acute interstitial pneumonia. We subsequently changed the diagnosis to viral pneumonia based on a multidisciplinary discussion considering the positive results of HBoV.
No specific treatment currently exists for HBoV infection. Our administration of corticosteroid with antibiotics failed. The significance of corticosteroid use in the treatment of pneumonia remains controversial (13) , and our patient's condition progressively deteriorated until her death despite its use. Further studies are needed to establish an effective treatment for this infection.
One limitation of the present study is that we were unable to measure the quantitative HBoV viral loads in the respiratory BAL fluid of our patient. Although a previous pediatric study showed that this measurement can quantitate disease severity (14) , viral loads for HBoV infection are not routinely assessed in our hospital.
We herein report a fatal case of primary HBoV pneumonia. Despite the high prevalence of pediatric HBoV infections, the virus continues to be underrecognized by many physicians. Our case shows that, even in immunocompetent adults, HBoV is an emerging pathogen that requires closer attention (15) .",Fatal Primary Human Bocavirus Pneumonia in an Immunocompetent Adult,"Ishiguro, Takashi; Hirota, Shuko; Kobayashi, Yasuhito; Takano, Kenji; Kobayashi, Yoichi; Shimizu, Yoshihiko; Takayanagi, Noboru",Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7028423/,89,1327,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,3fa8abac6ce337d7597f4c0d4adac979c4e0b9b7,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic started in late 2002 and swiftly spread across 5 continents with a mortality rate of around 10%. Although the epidemic was eventually controlled through the implementation of strict quarantine measures, there continues a need to investigate the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and develop interventions should it re-emerge. Numerous studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies against the virus can be found in patients infected with SARS-CoV within days upon the onset of illness and lasting up to several months. In contrast, there is little data on the kinetics of T cell responses during SARS-CoV infection and little is known about their role in the recovery process. However, recent studies in mice suggest the importance of T cells in viral clearance during SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, a growing number of studies have investigated the memory T cell responses in recovered SARS patients. This review covers the available literature on the emerging importance of T cell responses in SARS-CoV infection, particularly on the mapping of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, longevity, polyfunctionality and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association as well as their potential implications on treatment and vaccine development.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first emerged in Guangdong, China in late 2002 1 and infected more than 8000 people in 29 countries across 5 continents. 2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the fatality rate of the SARS outbreak was estimated to be 9.6%. Of those infected, healthcare workers and caretakers accounted for the majority. The SARS epidemic was officially controlled by July 2003 after the implementation of strict isolation of patients. Sometime into the epidemic, a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent. [3] [4] [5] Molecular epidemiology showed that at least two strains of SARS-CoV infected the patients in Hong Kong, 6 suggesting that the virus had jumped from animal sources to humans on two separate occasions. Later in 2005, reports from two laboratories identified a virus resident in Chinese horseshoe bats that is genetically similar to the human SARS-CoV, pinpointing the horseshoe bat to be a likely natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV. 7, 8 If this is indeed the case, a reemergence of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
Coronaviruses are a diverse group of large, enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses in the order Nilovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Coronavirus. Typically, they cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals. Using the open reading frame (ORF) 1a sequences, SARS-CoV was categorized as a subgroup of the group II coronaviruses. 9 The 30 kb poly-adenylated positive-stranded RNA genome 10, 11 has an genomic organization typical of a coronavirus where the first two ORFs (1a and 1b) encode the viral replicase that requires processing by the viral cysteine proteinases to yield the functional membrane-bound replicase complex and a group of 16 non-structural proteins (NSP). 12 Although some functions of these NSPs have been investigated and known, there are many others that still require further characterization (reviewed by Cheng et al. 13 ).
The SARS-CoV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocaspid (N). In addition, a set of unique accessory proteins (namely ORF 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b) is also found. Functionally, the N protein packs the RNA into a helical nucleocapsid; while the S protein forms the characteristic projections on the virion surface for the attachment and entry into the host cells; and together, N, M and E control the assembly of the virion. At present, no significant homology has been found for the accessory proteins to the viral proteins of other coronaviruses; in fact, they were found to be dispensable for virus replication in cell culture despite contributing to viral pathogenesis. 14, 15 Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV found in patients and animals infected with SARS-CoV block viral entry by binding to the S glycoprotein. 16 Besides the humoral response, the role of T cells in viral infections has been known to be just as important. Whilst neutralizing antibodies can prevent viral entry, the body also requires SARS-CoV specific CD4 1 T helper cells for the development of these specific antibodies. Similarly, CD8 1 cytotoxic T cells are important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. Despite the increasing number of reports that investigated memory CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cell responses in recovered SARS patients, there is a lack of data that describes the kinetics of the T cell response during a SARS-CoV infection. This review will focus on the memory T cell studies and its possible implications on treatment and vaccine development. For easy reference, all the T cell epitopes identified are summarized in Table 1 .
Amongst the SARS-CoV structural proteins, the S protein has been found to elicit neutralizing antibodies 17,18 with its major immunodominant epitope found between residues 441 to 700. Using an online database and with verification from T2 binding assays, the first two HLA-A*02:01-restricted T cell epitopes (S1203-1211 and S978-986) were identified in the S protein of SARS-CoV. 19 They were immunogenic and elicited high IFNc-specific T cell response in patients who have recovered from SARS. In comparison, the homologous peptide from HCoV229e did not elicit a significant response. A third CTL epitope, S1167-1175 (also known as SSp-1) was reported shortly after by another group. 20 This peptide was able to induce CTL response in HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice immunized with peptide loaded dendritic cells (DCs). At the same time, they were able to generate peptidespecific CD8 1 CTL in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy human donor. The same group also showed that heat inactivated SARS-CoV particles elicited CTL response to all three S epitopes (SSp-1, S978 and S1202) in patients' PBMCs one year postinfection. 21 Interestingly, 5 healthy individuals without contact history with SARS-CoV also exhibited SSp-1-specific responses in their PBMCs but exhibited lower cytotoxic activity and cytokine release when compared to the recovered SARS patients.
Other T cell epitopes identified include S787-795, S1042-1050 (found in the S2 domain) and S411-420 (P15) (found in the S1 domain) . 22, 23 These epitopes were found to be immunogenic and able to induce strong IFNc production from PBMCs of recovered SARS patients. At the same time, HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice immunized with DNA vaccines encoding the S protein were able to induce significant peptide-specific response. 24 In this study, the HLA-A*02:01 restricted epitope S958-966 (also known as Sp8), first identified based on HLA-A*02:01 binding peptide and proteosomal cleavage prediction systems, was found capable of inducing specific CTLs in the PBMCs of healthy individuals as well as in transgenic mice immunized with S DNA vaccine. 24 This suggests that there may already be SARS-CoV-specific CTL precursor cells within the T-cell repertoire of healthy individuals.
Animal studies using mice primed intramuscularly with S DNA vaccine and boosted with subcutaneous HLA-A*02:01 restricted peptides 25 or with the S DNA vaccine alone 26 elicited antigen-specific CD8 1 T cell responses. In fact, one recent study showed that primeboost immunization of transgenic mice with 5 of the HLA-A*02:01 S peptides together with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) could significantly enhance the frequency of peptide-specific CD8 1 T cells. 27 Taken together, the S protein is not only capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies but also contains several immunogenic T cell epitopes. Some of these epitopes found in either the S1 or S2 domain of the protein should therefore be considered during SARS-CoV vaccine development.
Besides the S glycoprotein, persistently high levels of anti-N protein antibodies and T cell responses were also found in the SARS-recovered individuals 2 years post-infection. 28, 29 For other coronaviruses, some protective effects were found to be conferred through N-specific CD8 1 T cells. 30, 31 Using a similar approach of HLA peptide binding prediction algorithm with validation from T2-cell binding assay, Tsao T cell immune response in SARS coronavirus infection HLJ Oh et al 2 et al. identified several HLA-A*02:01 restricted epitopes in the N protein (peptide N223-231, N227-235 and N317-325) and showed that they could induce specific CTL responses in transgenic mice immunized with N proteins or peptides with CpG ODN. 22 In addition, peptide N317-325 was able to stimulate the recall of CD8 1 T cell response in PBMCs of recovered SARS patients.
There had been numerous attempts to screen for CTL epitopes in the N protein through the use of overlapping peptides spanning the entire N protein. One such study that used PBMCs from recovered SARS patients 2 years post-infection has revealed that the major dominant antigenic site of the N protein lies in the C-terminal region (amino acids 331 to 362). At least 2 different T cell epitopes (N331-347 and N346-362) have been found in this region when the PBMCs were stimulated with a pool of 57 overlapping N peptides in vitro, followed by IFNc Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay. 28 Using the same approach, another group identified 2 potential CTL epitopes at positions N211-235 and N330-354 in the N protein. 32 More recently, we also identified the same dominant response (N216-230) in SARS-recovered patients 6 years post-infection. 33 This response was observed in 19% [3/16] of our cohort of recovered SARS patients. Similarly, a comprehensive study of T cell responses against all the SARS-CoV proteins conducted by Li et al. showed that 11% of their SARS subjects gave positive T cell responses against peptide N211-225, and it was identified as the most recognized epitope in the N protein. 34 Exact epitope mapping by our group further indicated that the CTL epitope was a 10 mer (N216-225) restricted by HLA-B*40:01 and that PBMCs from healthy individuals can be transduced to become N peptide-specific T cells. 33 In one of the first animal studies conducted in monkeys, adenoviralbased vectors were used to test the efficacy of the S, M and N proteins. 35 The monkeys were injected intramuscularly with adenoviral-based vectors that expressed codon-optimized S1 domain, M and N proteins. The S1 domain of the S protein was found to induce strong humoral response, while the N protein elicited high frequency of IFNc-producing T cells as determined using N peptides as the antigen in the ELISPOT assay. This was the first indication that the N protein could be a good vaccine candidate for cell-mediated T cell response. This phenomenon was also found in mice where DNA vaccines encoding the N protein elicited good T cell responses. 36-39 C3H/ He mice intramuscularly immunized with N protein pcDNA-fn vector showed both high antibody titre and CTL activity after 3 injections; 36 and using Balb/c mice, two other groups showed that DNA vaccines encoding N protein alone could elicit T cell proliferation, IFNc release, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and in vivo cytotoxic T cell activity. 37, 38 Further experiments reported enhanced T cell response when calreticulin (CRT)-linked DNA vaccine was used 39 or DNA vaccination was performed with the addition of a chemical adjuvant levamisole. 38 Synthetic N peptides coupled to the surface of liposomes were also reported to enhance T cell response. 40 These synthetic N peptides not only induced CTL response, but the mice were also able to clear vaccinia virus-expressing SARS-CoV epitopes when challenged. 40 In summary, several different studies have identified immunogenic regions in amino acids 211 to 362 of the N protein to contain T cell epitopes. However, to date, the only epitope characterized in detail is the 10-mer epitope (N216-225) which is restricted by HLA-B*40:01. 33 
There are very few studies of T cell response to other SARS-CoV proteins. Nonetheless, animal studies using DNA vaccines suggest that the M protein may induce T cell response, albeit to a lesser degree than the S and N proteins. 38 Yang et al. demonstrated that it was possible to induce recall T cell response from the PBMCs of SARS patients who have recovered for more than 1 year by using overlapping peptides spanning the entire M protein. 41 In this study, four human T cell immunodominant peptides, M21-44, M65-91, M117-140 and M200-220, were subsequently identified. Similarly, Li et al. also reported that 9% of their SARS subjects had T cell response against the M peptide region, M146-160. 34 The largest accessory protein of SARS-CoV is the 3a protein of 274 amino acids. However, other than Li et al.'s report, there had been no demonstration of T cell responses against this protein. The 3a protein peptide 3a36-50 was one of the three most frequently recognized T cell epitopes identified in their study. 34 Similar to the results reported by Li et al. our data showed that the 3a protein peptide 3a6-20 was able to elicit both CD8 1 and CD4 1 responses. 33 Interestingly, mice immunized with 3a DNA vaccine were shown to have high levels of humoral response as well as Th1 response. 42 These observations indicated that the accessory 3a protein is immunogenic and able to induce T cell response.
Although T cell response could be observed for the M protein, current studies seem to suggest that the 3a protein is more immunogenic in comparison, and T cell epitopes identified in it may play an important role in recovery from a primary SARS-CoV infection and in vaccine development.
To date, there is only one study that investigated T cell response against whole SARS-CoV in humans. 34 In this study, PBMCs from 1-year post-infected patients showed T cell response to eight (replicase, S, N, E, M, 3a, 3b, and 9b) out of the fourteen SARS-CoV proteins when tested using overlapping peptides spanning the entire SARS-CoV genome. Of the 70% of T cell responses elicited against the structural proteins, the S protein induced the most dominant responses (41%). In fact, the three most commonly recognized T cell epitope were that of one found in 3a, and the other two in the S protein (S435-451 and S633-650). The latter were not reported in the other studies. Although both CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cell responses were observed in the study, the frequency and magnitude of the CD8 1 T cell responses were greater than the CD4 1 T cell responses. However, the CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells were found to have similar central memory phenotypes (CD27 1 and CD45RO 1 ) . A separate study by Peng et al. showed that the N-specific CD4 1 T cells had central memory (CD45RA 2 CCR7 1 CD62L 2 ), whereas most of the CD8 1 T cells had effector memory (CD45RA 1 CCR7 2 CD62L 2 ) phenotype. 28 Similar observations were made with the M-specific CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells, 41 whilst the S-specific CD8 1 T cells were reported to have effector memory (CD45RA 1 CCR7 2 CD62L 2 ) phenotype. 21 Using peptides in the four SARS-CoV structural proteins, an analysis of the memory T cell response in recovered SARS patients four years post-infection revealed that both CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells produced IFNc. 43 In support of Li et al.'s study, 34 Fan et al. also found that CD4 1 memory T cells produce IL-2, TNFa and IFNc, with the exception of one patient. 43 It was also observed that S peptides induced the highest percentages of IFNc producing cells. Interestingly, the frequency of these polyfunctional CD4 1 T cells (T cells producing multiple cytokines) was higher in the individuals with severe SARS infection than in moderately severe patients. 34 On the other hand, this difference between moderate severe and severe patients was Nonetheless, a proportion of the CD8 1 T cells were found to produce TNFa and degranulate (with the detection of CD107a). Since polyfunctional T cells were associated with better control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and vaccination efficacy, 44, 45 we further characterized the cytokine profile of the SARSspecific T cells in our recent study. 33 A summary of our findings is shown in Figure 1 . We have observed that the majority of CD4 1 T cells produced IFNc, IL-2, and TNFa, with a small percentage of the cells also simultaneously producing inflammatory cytokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1a, MIP 1b and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Of these, the majority of the CD8 1 T cells produced IFNc, TNFa, MIP 1a or MIP 1b alone or in combination. Only a small percentage produced IFNc, IL-2, and TNFa. Moving forward, we cloned the a and b T cell receptor (TCR) chains of one immunodominant CTL epitope in the N protein (amino acid 216 to 225) from the SARS-CoV specific CD8 1 T cells and used them to redirect the specificity of lymphocytes of healthy subjects lacking SARS-CoV specific memory T cells. These TCR-redirected T cells were found to possess a cytokine production profile similar to SARS-CoV specific memory CD8 1 T cells in recovered SARS patients (as mentioned above). Thus we proposed that these T cells may be potential therapeutic treatments for this life threatening infection.
Despite the numerous reports describing the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in primary infected patients (reviewed by Zhu et al. 46 ), it is not known if these cytokines are beneficial or contribute to the pathogenicity of the infection. Moreover, there is currently no report confirming the protective effect of T cells during a primary SARS-CoV infection in humans. In fact, research in this area is hampered by the lack of systematic sample collection during the 2003 SARS outbreak which lasted for a relatively short period of , 16 weeks. Since there is no second major outbreak of SARS, the protective effect of memory T cell response in recovered SARS patients is not known. Nevertheless, the phenotype and cytokine profile of the T cells in these recovered individuals indicate the possible protective effect of T cell response in the initial infection or during any subsequent infections.
The association of certain HLA genotypes with increased resistance or the ability to clear viral infections have been reported in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human papillomavirus studies. [47] [48] [49] [50] Although earlier studies done on SARS patients from Taiwan and Hong Kong suggested that the HLA-B, HLA-Cw and HLA-DR alleles were highly associated with SARS infection and disease development, [51] [52] [53] further investigation is required. Of these literature, SARS individuals from Hong Kong showed that HLA-B*07:03 and HLA-DR*03:01 conferred factors for susceptibility and resistance to SARS infection, respec-tively. 53 In agreement with this, a study on a Taiwanese cohort of SARS patients found that both HLA-Cw*15:02 and HLA-DR*03:01 were associated with resistance to SARS infection. 54 These observations suggested the important role of HLA-DR*03:01 in viral disease progression through enhancing the function of CD4 1 T helper cells. Similarly, we observed that the CD8 1 T cell responses against both the N and 3a proteins were all restricted by HLA-B subtype (unpublished data), thus pointing to the possible role of HLA-B subtypes in viral immunity. Among the HLA class I genes, HLA-B is known to be the most polymorphic, 55 and was associated in protective roles against the HIV, 56-58 HCV 59 and acute influenza infections. 60 CONCLUSION Currently, no antiviral therapy has yet been proven useful for SARS. Attempts to test potential anti-SARS agents using antiviral antibodies, entry inhibitors, proteinase inhibitors, calpain inhibitors, ribavirin (nucleoside analogues), interferons, and short interfering RNAs were riddled with contradictory reports from different laboratories. The lack of clinical trials also prevented the reaching of a conclusive agreement for effective anti-SARS strategies (reviewed by Weiss et al. 61 ). Nevertheless, human convalescent-phase plasma seemed to shorten hospitalization without adverse effects if it is administered as an immunotherapy to SARS patients early in the course of infection. 62 With the finding that recovered SARS patients have higher and more sustainable levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to those who had succumbed to the disease, 63 monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization were also obtained using phage-display antibody libraries and immortalization of B cells from convalescent SARS patients. 64, 65 Although it is still not known whether naturally acquired immune responses can confer protection from re-infection of SARS-CoV, vaccines are likely to be the most effective way to provide protection against a future re-emergence of SARS-CoV. Several strategies for vaccine development included DNA vaccines, inactivated whole virus vaccines, 66, 67 virus-like particles, 68,69 recombinant virus vector vaccines, 70 and recombinant protein vaccine. 71 Most SARS-CoV vaccines that elicited neutralizing antibodies are believed to be protective, but as described, T cells may also play an important role in viral clearance in a primary SARS-CoV infection. 72, 73 Zhao et al. suggested that inefficient immune activation and a poor virus-specific T cell response underlay severe disease in SARS-CoV infected mice. 74 In their recent report, they showed that virus-specific T cells were necessary and sufficient for virus clearance and protection from clinical disease in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) virus-infected mice. 73 In addition, CD4 1 T cells in a senescent mouse model were found to play an important role in viral clearance in a primary infection with SARS-CoV. 72 In humans, SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells were found to persist in the peripheral blood of SARS patients up to 6 years Figure 1 Diagram showing the cytokine profiles of the CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells from SARS recovered patients. The big and small arrows indicate the major and minor populations of CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells producing the cytokines indicated respectively.
T cell immune response in SARS coronavirus infection HLJ Oh et al 4 post-infection despite a lack of specific memory B cell response in these patients. 75 This seems to suggest that SARS-CoV-specific T cell response could persist longer and thus indicating that cell-mediated immune response is important for protecting against re-infection. As all these studies suggest that T cell may play a crucial role in the clearance of SARS-CoV, there is therefore a need for detailed characterization of the T cell response to SARS-CoV for the development of future vaccine candidates.
Finally, it is important to note that T cells can play a protective and/ or pathological role during an infection. In the case of mouse-hepatitis virus (MHV), an increase of morbidity and mortality in infected mice has been associated with memory T cells. 76 Although no direct evidence have shown that SARS-CoV-specific T cell responses contribute to immunopathology in SARS, it is a question that needs to be further addressed.

When cells pre-challenged with RAbV were treated with rAAV-N796, there was a 4.4 ± 1.4 to 28.8 ± 3.2% reduction in RABV virus titer. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR and Western blot revealed that the knockdown of RAbV-N gene transcripts was based on the rAAV-N796 inoculation titer. When any NA cells were treated with rAAV-N796 before or after challenged with RABV, significant reduction in virus titer was observed in both administrations. Mice treated intracerebrally with rAAV-N796 exhibited 50 ± 5.3 and 62.5 ± 4.7% protection when challenged intracerebrally or intramuscally, respectively, with lethal RAbV. When mice treated intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 were challenged intramuscularly with lethal RAbV, they exhibited 37.5 ± 3.7% protection. When mice were intracerebrally and intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 24 hr after exposure to RAbV infection, they exhibited 25 ± 4.1% protection The N gene mRNA levels in the brains of challenged mice with three different administrations were reduced (55, 68, 32 and 25%, respectively). These results indicated that AAV2 vector-mediated siRNA delivery in vitro in NA cells inhibited RAbV multiplication, inhibited RAbV multiplication in vivo in the mice brain and imparted partial protection against lethal rabies. So, it may have a potential to be used as an alternative antiviral approach against rabies.","Rabies is a disease of the central nervous system that constantly produces victims in human beings as well as in animals. Rabies cases are reported worldwide, but are most prevalent in undeveloped countries, specifically in rural areas of Africa and Asia. No definitive and effective treatment has been established to cure the disease once the clinical stage has been reached, and only a small portion of clinical cases responds to intensive therapeutic management and survives [19] . Once the clinical symptoms of rabies appear, conventional post-exposure treatment is unsuccessful, because of its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier [9] . Thus, the current strategy to control rabies is pre-exposure prophylaxis by vaccine injection, but research efforts are focused on developing an effective, safe prophylactic and/or therapeutic tool against RAbV infection.
RNAi mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is a powerful technology allowing the silencing of genes with great specificity and potency. The RNAi strategy has already been successfully applied to inhibit the replication of many viruses, including hepatitis b virus (HbV) [13] , dengue virus (DNV) [14] , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [10] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [11] and influenza virus [21] . Considering the potential of RNAi as an antiviral agent, few groups have evaluated RNAi-based antiviral agents against rabies [2, 8] . However, one of the potential limitations for applying this technology is developing an effective and targeted delivery tool.
Viral vectors are one of the major vehicles used by scientists in gene therapy to get their sequences expressed in the proper host. Viral vectors, including adenovirus, retrovirus, lentivirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV), are undoubtedly efficient tools for gene delivery. They have been widely used in delivering various genes and siRNAs. More recently, Gupta et al. and Sonwane et al. reported that an adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of small hairpin (sh)RNAs targeting the RAbV N or polymerase (L) mRNA led to a slight increase in survival of RAbV-infected mice [7, 16, 20] . So far, no research group has reported whether AAV can work as an siRNA delivery tool and transport a siRNA targeting RAbV into the cells or host to inhibit the RAbV replication.
In this study, we constructed recombinant AAV vectors based on serotype 2 (rAAV2) expressing siRNA targeting the N gene of RAbV. In in vitro and in vivo experiments, rAAV2 could efficiently inhibit the replication of RABV.
were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FbS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Hyclone, Logan, UT, U.S.A.) at 37°C. The RAbV virus standard (CVS)-11 strain was obtained from the Changchun Institute of Veterinary Science (Changchun, China). Female bALb/c mice (weighing 13-15 g; Changchun Institute of biological Products, Changchun, China) were used to assess the antiviral activities of the rAAV2 in vivo. All experiments with the RAbV virus were conducted in a biosafety level three laboratory facility at the Changchun Institute of Veterinary Science.
Plasmid construction: pAAV-hrGFP, pAAV-RC and pHelper are described in the information provided for the AAV Helper-Free System (Catalog #240071, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.). siRNA-796 targeting the N gene was inserted into the pSilence2.1-U6 Hygro siRNA expression vector (Ambion, Austin, TX, U.S.A.) by bamHI and HindIII (ps-N796). The ps-N796 plasmid transported by a liposome could inhibit RAbV replication in vitro and vivo [20] . The siRNA expressing box containing CMV, cGFP, U6 promoter and siRNA was amplified, and NotI was introduced into 5' and 3'. The siRNA-expressing box was digested with NotI and inserted into pAAV-hrGFP treated with NotI (pAAV-N796). The negative control was named with pAAV-Neg. The pAAV-N796 encoding the specific shRNAs is shown in Fig. 1 .
AAV vector production: rAAV-N796 or rAAV-Neg vectors were produced by liposome-mediated co-transfection of pAAV-N796 or pAAV-Neg, pAAV-RC and pHelper in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells according to the protocol. Briefly, 2 hr before transfection, each 10-cm-diameter plate of human 293 cells (80% confluent) was fed 10 ml of fresh DMEM containing 10% FbS without antibiotics. A total of 25 mg of plasmid DNA were dissolved in 1 ml of Liposome 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and then mixed and added to the cells after incubation for 25 min. At 4 to 6 hr after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 2% FbS and antibiotics. The cells and suspensions were harvested at 72 hr post infection. After low-speed centrifugation on a tabletop centrifuge, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mM NaCl-10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and subjected to four cycles of freeze-thaw and removal of cell debris. The rAAV particles were then Transduction with rAAV and infection with RABV in NA cells: NA cells were plated at 1 × 10 6 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. The rAAV was inoculated into cells with different viral titers. After transduction for 2 hr, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 2% FbS and antibiotics. After 24 hr of transduction, the cells were infected with 0.01 MOI of the RAbV CVS-11 virus for 48 hr. Another method was infection of cells with 0.01 MOI of the RAbV CVS-11 virus for 6 hr and then inoculation with rAAV.
Viral titer assay: Viral titer was measured using 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) assays. Serial 10-fold dilutions of supernatants from the treated and viral samples were added onto a monolayer of bHK-21 cells in 96-well culture plates and incubated for two days. Virus concentrations were measured by direct fluorescent antibody staining (DFA), as described above, and the viral titer for each sample was calculated by the Reed-Muench method [15] .
Real-time PCR: NA cells or mouse brains were harvested after RAbV infection, and total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.). The levels of N mRNA transcripts were determined by qPCR using brilliant II SYbR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.) and the following gene-specific primers: forward primer (1168-1187 in genome) 5'-TCAAGAATATGAGGCGGCTG-3' and reverse primer (1356-1375 in genome) 5'-TGGACGGGCTTGAT-GATTGG-3' for CVS11-N (207 bp amplicon), and forward primer 5'-TGACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGA-3' and reverse primer 5'-GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGTGAG-3' for β-actin (86 bp amplicon). The PCR was carried out on an Mx 3000P System. The relative expression values of N gene were normalized to the expression value of the β-actin gene.
Western blotting: NA cells were harvested after 72 hr of RAbV infection, and total protein samples were obtained by incubation in cell lysis buffer (beyotime biotech Inc., Nantong, China). Protein concentration was measured with a bicinchoninic acid (bCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.). Fifty microgram aliquots of total protein were resolved by sodium SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The resultant blots were probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to RAbV N protein (1:200) or a mouse monoclonal antibody to β-actin (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.), followed by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce).
Viral challenge in mice: Mice, in groups of eleven, were anesthetized with dry ice and inoculated intracerebrally or intramuscularly (in masseter muscle) with the rAAV (2 by ITRs. An siRNA transcript was produced by the U6 promoter, and a cGFP transcript was produced by the CMV promoter. CMV IE was the enhancer for the U6 promoter and CMV promoter. × 10 12 vg/kg). After 48hr, the mice were infected with 10 LD 50 of RAbV CVS-11 for intracerebral challenge and 20 LD 50 of RAbV CVS-11 for intramuscular challenge at the same inoculation site as the rAAV inoculation site. The third group of mice was inoculated intracerebrally with the rAAV and then challenged with 20 LD 50 of RAbV CVS-11 intramuscularly (in masseter muscle) more than 48 hr after inoculation with rAAV (2 × 10 12 vg/kg). The forth group of mice was infected with RAbV intramuscularly and inoculated with rAAV-N796 or rAAV-Neg intracerebrally and intramuscularly after infection for 24 hr. At 6 days post infection with RAbV CVS-11, three mice from each group were anesthetized, and their brains were collected for assay of virus titer; the other mice were observed for 21 days for survival. All animal researches were conducted under the guidance of the CDC's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited facility.
The animal research in our study was approved by the Jilin Province Animal Disease Control Center. Statistical analysis: Statistical significance of differences between experimental groups was determined through the use of the paired, nonparametric Student's t-test. P<0.05 was consider a significant difference.
To evaluate the antiviral effects of rAAV-N796 targeting the conserved sequences of the CVS11-N gene, the rAAV-N796 and a negative control (rAAV-Neg) were respectively inoculated into NA cells with 10 vg/cell. The transduction efficiency of rAAV in NA cells was more than 90% (result not shown). After transduction for 24 hr, the cells were infected with 0.01 MOI of the RAbV CVS-11 virus. At the different time points, the cells supernatants were collected for analysis of RAbV titer. As shown in Fig. 2A , the virus titer in the rAAV-N796 group was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that in the rAAV-Neg group at each time point. At 72 hr post infection, the virus titer (TCID 50 /ml of 3.5 ± 0.65) in the rAAV-N796 pretreatment group was reduced by nearly 10 4 times (P<0.01) compared with the rAAV-Neg group (TCID 50 /ml of 7.8 ± 0.82). When RAbV infection was before rAAV transduction, no significant difference was observed at 24 and 48 hr post infection. Only at 72 and 96 hr post infection (Fig. 2b) was the RABV titer reduced significantly (P<0.05). These results indicated that the inoculation of rAAV-N796 before RAbV infection could inhibit the virus replication well, but that inoculation of rAAV-N796 after RAbV infection inhibited virus replication only at later time points.
To check whether the antiviral activity of the rAAV-N796 in NA cells depended on the inoculation titer of rAAV-N796, as show in Fig. 2C and 2E, the NA cells were transduced with different titers of rAAV-N796 (1, 10 and 100 vg/cell) and were infected with 0.01 MOI of the RAbV CVS-11 virus after transduction for 24 hr. At 72 hr post infection, the cells were collected for assay of N gene mRNA level and protein level. The results showed that the N gene mRNA level was reduced by 78.54 ± 6.8, 45.61 ± 5.3 and 25.10 ± 3.5%, respectively, compared with the rAAV-Neg group. When NA cells were infected with RABV firstly and then transduced with different titers of rAAV-N796 (1, 10 and 100 vg/cell) ( Fig. 2D and 2F ), a significant lower N gene mRNA level (P<0.05) was observed in higher rAAV-N796 titer groups (10 and 100 vg/cell), but not in the lower rAAV-N796 titer group (1 vg/cell). The N protein level also showed the similar result. The higher the rAAV-N796 titer was, the lower the N protein level was, which indicated that the antiviral activity of the rAAV-N796 in NA cells depended on the titer of rAAV-N796.
Collectively, these results demonstrated that the rAAV-N796 could significantly inhibit replication of the CVS-11 virus in NA cells and that the antiviral activity from pretreatment of rAAV-N796 was better than that with treatment after infection.
To test whether the inhibition of RAbV replication observed in vitro for rAAV-N796 was adequate for protection in vivo, we used an established bALb/c mouse model of RAbV. To test whether rAAV-N796 could protect mice from RAbV infection in the brain, as shown in Fig. 3A , the mice were first intracerebrally treated with rAAV-N796 and were then intracerebrally challenged with a lethal dose (10 LD 50 ) of CVS-11 48 hr later. Compared with the rAAV-Neg-treated mice, all of the rAAV-N796-treated mice showed fewer clinical signs of disease and lower morbidity. Moreover, the mouse survival rates in the rAAV-N796-treated groups showed higher survival rates than the rAAV-Neg-treated mice. At 21 days post-challenge, the mouse survival rate in the rAAV-N796-treated groups was 50 ± 5.3%, and all the mice in the rAAV-Neg-treated groups died at 18 days post-challenge.
To test whether rAAV-N796 could protect mice from RAbV infection in the masseter muscle, as shown in Fig.  3b , the mice were intramuscularly treated with rAAV-N796 and then intramuscularly challenged with a lethal dose (20 LD 50 ) of RAbV CVS-11 48 hr later. The results showed that there was partial protection (37.5 ± 3.7%) against virulent RAbV challenge in mice pretreated with rAAV-N796 and no protection in mice pretreated with rAAV-Neg. To check whether intracerebral inoculation with rAAV-N796 could protect mice from intramuscular infection with RAbV, as shown in Fig. 3C , the mice were first intracerebrally treated with rAAV-N796 and were then intramuscularly challenged with a lethal dose (20 LD 50 ) of RAbV CVS-11 48 hr later. Treatment of mice with rAAV-N796 demonstrated 62.5 ± 4.7% protection, and all the mice treated with rAAV-Neg died at 21 days post-challenge. The mice that survived did not develop symptoms and remained healthy for the entire period of experimentation. Moreover, at 6 days post challenge, we checked the N gene mRNA level in the brain for the three administrations. The results showed (Fig. 3E) that N gene mRNA level in the rAAV-N796-treated mice brain was significantly decreased. Also, the N gene mRNA level in the intracerebral pretreatment group was lower than that in the intramuscular pretreatment group, which agreed with the result pertaining to mouse survival rate.
Post-exposure vaccination is obligatory in all cases as treatment after human exposure to infected animal bites. Regarding whether rAAV-N796 could protect mice exposed to RABV infection within 24 hr, the mice were first intramuscularly challenged with a lethal dose (20 LD 50 ) of RAbV CVS-11 and were then injected with rAAV-N796 intracerebrally and intramuscularly 24 hr later. The results (Fig. 3D) showed that there was a partial protection (25 ± 4.1%) and no protection in mice treated with rAAV-Neg. The N gene mRNA level in the rAAV-N796-treated mouse brain was significantly decreased compared with the control (Fig. 3E) .
So, these results provided evidence that rAAV-N796 treatment could inhibit RAbV replication and conferred partial protection against lethal rabies challenge.
Rabies is one of the oldest and most fatal viral diseases known to mankind, and clinical rabies, in which the virus invades the central nervous system, is incurable [17] . There is a need for development of an effective anti-rabies approach. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy to suppress virus replication in vitro and in vivo without damaging the host cell. However, one of the potential limitations for applying this technology is developing an effective and targeted delivery tool.
In this study, we developed a universal siRNA agent that would recognize different RABV strains by using the N gene, which is the most highly conserved gene among the five RABV genes [21] . Moreover, we selected the most conserved sequences of the N transcript for use as RNAi targets. widely used in delivering various genes and siRNAs. but, these viral vectors could stimulate host immune response and produce a specific antibody against viral vectors, which would restrict the use again in the same host. In addition to unwanted activation of the immune response, the safety concerns also involve off-targeting effects. AAV vectors have been highly successful in overcoming these disadvantages. They are currently among the most frequently used viral vectors for gene therapy. Twelve human serotypes of AAV (AAV-1 to AAV-12) and more than 100 serotypes from nonhuman primates have been discovered to date [4] . The characterization of new AAV serotypes has revealed that they have different patterns of transduction in diverse tissues [3] . AAV has become increasingly common as a vector for use in human clinical trials, such as immunodeficiency disease [5] , muscle directed gene therapy [6] and lung disease [12] . AAV-2-based rAAV vectors can transduce muscle, the liver, the brain, the retina and the lungs [4] . rAAV2 has emerged as a vector of choice for gene transfer to the central nervous system, because of its strong neuronal tropism and lack of pathogenicity in mammals [4] . Moreover, AAV-2 has been shown to induce a weak cellmediated immune response. This may be attributed to AAV inefficiently infecting mature dendritic cells (DC) [22] . So, in this study, we made use of an AAV-2 vector to deliver the siRNA targeting the RAbV N gene. The results in the in vitro (NA cells) and in vivo (mice brain and muscle) experiments showed that AAV-2 can work as a good siRNA delivery tool.
The AAV-2 genome is a linear, single-stranded DNA of 4.7 kb [1] . After infection, second-strand synthesis is needed. So, the gene expression time would be later than other double-stranded DNA virus vectors. In the in vitro experiment, if rAAV-N796 treatment was later than RAbV infection, the antiviral effect was not displayed at 24 and 48 hr post infection, but was displayed at 72 and 96 hr post infection (Fig. 2b) . The reason for this may be ascribe to the later gene expression. After the AAV-2 synthesizes the second-strand, shRNA begins to be transcribed by the U6 promoter. During the time of second-strand synthesis, the replication of RAbV was not inhibited, and the virus has replicated for several cycles. The RAbV titers of rAAV-N796 and rAAV-Neg treatment groups were both increased with the same efficiency. So, the antiviral effect was not observed in early infection.
Clinical rabies, the CNS form of the disease, can be treated with anti-rabies RNAi through elimination of RAbV from the infected neurons by delivering anti-rabies siRNA effectively to the neurons [17] . rAAV2 has emerged as a vector of choice for gene transfer to the central nervous system [3] . So, in the in vivo experiment, the antiviral effect of intracerebral inoculation with rAAV-N796 (50 and 62% survival, respectively) was better than with intramuscular inoculation (38% survival). Whether the transduction efficiency in muscle is higher than in the brain needs to be investigated further. The survival rate of the intracerebral inoculation and infection group (50% survival) was lower than that of the intracerebral inoculation and intramuscular infection group (63% survival). After infection with RAbV, the time until symptoms were shown was associated with the site of infection. Once RAbV is introduced through the skin or mucous membrane, it replicates in the myocytes for hours or weeks and then migrates to nerves. If RAbV was introduced into the brain, it would replicate quickly. During the process of RAbV entry into brain from masseter muscle, rAAV-N796 has more time to transduce the neural cells and produce more siRNA than direct intracerebral infection. So, the antiviral effect of intracerebral inoculation and intramuscular infection was better than that of intracerebral inoculation and infection.
The antiviral activity of the rAAV-N796 was present after exposure to RAbV infection 24 hr later. However, the antiviral activity of rAAV-N796 would be lost, if the mice were injected with rAAV-N796 after showing the symptoms (data not shown). To retain the antiviral activity of rAAV-N796 after exposure to RAbV infection, the time of injection with rAAV-N796 should be within 24 hr.
The antiviral activity of rAAV-N796 in NA cells depended on the titer of rAAV-N796. In the in vivo experiment, rAAV-N796 pretreatment did not achieve complete protection, which may be associated with the inoculation dose of rAAV-N796. The biggest rAAV titer achieved in our lab through co-transfection in HEK293 cells is 4 × 10 11 vg/ml. So, a better method to produce rAAV particles needs to be established. The production of rAAV vectors in insect cells via the use of recombinant baculovirus technology has proven to be an efficient and scalable means of rAAV production. The yield of genome-containing particles produced per Sf9 cell approached 5 × 10 4 ; thus, 1,000 ml of cultured Sf9 cells produced the equivalent of between 500 to 1,000 × 175 cm 2 flasks of 293 cells. This robust system provides a simple, cost-effective method for AAV vector production [18] . However, to achieve complete protection, other siRNAs targeting the RAbV gene, the rAAV titer and the timing of therapeutic administration should be assessed to generate an optimal treatment strategy [20] .",Adeno-Associated Viruses Serotype 2-Mediated RNA Interference Efficiently Inhibits Rabies Virus Replication In Vitro and In Vivo,"WU, Hong-Xia; WANG, Hua-Lei; GUO, Xiao-Feng; YANG, Yu-Jiao; MA, Jin-Zhu; WANG, Tie-Cheng; GAO, Yu-Wei; ZHAO, Yong-Kun; YANG, Song-Tao; XIA, Xian-Zhu",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942934/,270,3390,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,a60e292d31e4bb27e20f3ace17fc295ad60990c8,"were analyzed. Results: Of 23,534 travelers, 61% were non-occupational and 39% occupational. Business travelers were more likely to be men, had short times to departure and shorter trip durations, and commonly refused influenza, meningococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines. Most business travelers indicated that employers suggested the pre-travel health consultation, whereas non-occupational travelers sought consultations because of travel health concerns. Conclusions: Sub-groups of occupational travelers have characteristic profiles, with business travelers being particularly distinct. Employers play a role in encouraging business travelers to seek pretravel consultations. Such consultations, even if scheduled immediately before travel, can identify vaccination gaps and increase coverage.","I n 2014, 1.1 billion travelers crossed international borders. 1 A 2012 report outlined that 18% of US residents visiting overseas destinations traveled for business purposes, and each traveler had a median of three international trips in the past 12 months and a median stay of 8 nights per trip. 2 Business travelers may face different health risks than leisure travelers, including occupational exposures and increased levels of stress due to their work schedules. 3, 4 In addition, business travelers are increasingly visiting developing countries. 4, 5 Research suggests that the risk of illness increases with greater differences in climate and culture between the country of origin and the destination country. 6 Further, occupational travel may contribute to the importation of disease to the traveler's home workplace and larger community; such importations often require costly workplace and public health responses. Many infections associated with occupational travel can be prevented by simple preventative measures, such as vaccines, medications, and health advice.
Pre-travel health consultations are an opportunity to assess and mitigate the risk of illness and injury for travelers. Such evaluations review destination-specific epidemiology of illness and injury, risk factors related to the itinerary and the traveler's medical history, severity and treatability of diseases if acquired, and availability and efficacy of chemoprophylaxis or vaccination. 7 To understand more about pre-travel preparations and trip characteristics of business and other occupational travelers, we analyzed the pre-travel health consultations of travelers seeking care in Global TravEpiNet (GTEN), a large consortium of US clinics that provides pre-travel health consultations. 8 The purpose of this article is two-fold: (1) to describe occupational travelers by category of self-selection (business, providing medical care, providing non-medical service work, participating in missionary work, taking part in research/education) and (2) to compare business travelers with leisure travelers and with those who were visiting friends and relatives (VFRs).
GTEN is a consortium of US medical practices that includes academic institutions, health maintenance organizations, pharmacybased clinics, and public health clinics that provide pre-travel health consultations to international travelers; it is described in detail elsewhere. 8 In brief, GTEN collects data from pre-travel consultations of international travelers visiting consortium sites. This data collection began in January 2009 and is ongoing; data collected from 18 clinics from January 2009 through December 2012 were used for this analysis. Human Subjects Advisors at each participating site reviewed and approved or exempted the collection and subsequent analyses of the de-identified data.
GTEN data are collected using a secure online tool, which creates an individual traveler medical note and provides guidance to the health care provider on the latest recommendations published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Travelers self-reported, into the tool, their sex, age, country of birth, purpose of travel, destinations, itinerary-related details, reasons for seeking the pre-travel consultation, medications, and medical conditions. Anyone born in the 50 US states or US Virgin Islands was considered ''US born.'' Health care providers verified the information provided by the traveler and also recorded the patient's previous vaccination status, vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis that were recommended, and health education that was provided. If a recommended vaccination was not given, the provider was prompted to give a reason for non-vaccination, including the following: vaccine was not available, insufficient time for completion before departure, patient declined, referral to primary care provider for administration, or medical contraindication. For rabies vaccine, clinicians were prompted to provide a reason if the vaccine was not recommended for those traveling for longer than 1 month (defined as 28 days).
We evaluated the proportion of GTEN travelers vaccinated for the following diseases: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); hepatitis B; influenza; varicella; tetanus; hepatitis A; yellow fever (YF); typhoid; rabies; meningococcal; polio; and Japanese encephalitis (JE). For this analysis, MMR, influenza, varicella and tetanus vaccines were defined as generally recommended for all travelers before departure if they were not already immune. The proportion of travelers vaccinated for hepatitis A, hepatitis B ,and typhoid was assessed for specific groups going to endemic countries (high-and intermediate-risk countries for hepatitis A and B; highrisk countries for typhoid) based on the most current CDC recommendations available at the time of the consultation. 9,10 The proportion of travelers vaccinated for polio, rabies, meningococcal disease, JE, and YF was assessed for specific groups of at-risk travelers who met criteria (eg, destination country with risk, season with risk, duration of stay, or indicated for the itinerary) for recommended vaccination; a more extensive description of travelers who were considered at risk is available elsewhere. 11 For all vaccines, if the clinician indicated existing immunity or if the traveler received at least the first dose of a vaccine series at the pre-travel consultation, the traveler was considered, for this analysis, vaccinated for that disease. To analyze reasons for nonvaccination, we excluded those who were previously immune, were vaccinated at the clinic visit, or for whom information was not known.
To accurately evaluate the trip duration and activities, only travelers with one purpose of travel and one itinerary were included. Travelers younger than 18 years were excluded from all analyses because they are less likely to travel for business or other occupational reasons, and legally do not make the primary decisions regarding their health care.
Travelers self-defined their purpose of travel; those who selected business as their purpose of travel were classified as business travelers. We also considered the following purposes of travel to be occupational: providing medical care, providing nonmedical service work, participating in missionary work, and taking part in research/education. Non-occupational travelers were classified as those traveling for leisure or those visiting friends and relatives. In accordance with the CDC definition, those VFRs were defined as those who selected their reason of travel as ''returning to region of origin of self or family to visit friends and relatives'' and who were visiting at least one United Nations Human Development Index low-or low-middle-income country. 12 Other purposes of travel collected by the GTEN tool, including military deployment, receiving medical care, adoption, adventure, attending large gatherings or events, and other, were excluded from the analysis.
We conducted two analyses: (1) a general description of business and all other occupational travelers in GTEN, and (2) a comparison of business travelers to those traveling for non-occupational purposes (leisure and VFR). We analyzed all data by using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For bivariate analyses of categorical variables between business travelers and leisure (or VFR) travelers, random intercept models were used with clinic site as the random effect to account for possible between-clinic variation and Morel, Bokossa, and Neerchal adjustment to correct for the small number of sites. 13 Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparative analyses of continuous variables. A two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Of 39,589 total GTEN travelers, 23,534 (59%) met our inclusion criteria. Of these travelers, 9248 (39%) were occupational (including business travelers) and 14,286 (61%) were non-occupational. Of the 9248 occupational travelers, 4174 (45%) were business travelers, 1714 (19%) were performing research/education, 1249 (14%) were participating in missionary work, 1215 (13%) were providing non-medical service work, and 896 (10%) were providing medical care (Table 1) . Among the non-occupational travelers, 13,095 (92%) were leisure and 1191 (8%) were VFR travelers. (Table 2 )
Most (more than 59%) of the occupational travelers, except for business (39%), were women (Table 1) . Among all occupational travelers, missionaries and non-medical service workers sought pretravel care further in advance of their departure date, with median times to departure of 33 and 32 days, respectively. Business travelers had the shortest time to departure (median 15 days). Most business travelers (52%) indicated that their employer suggested they make the pre-travel health appointment, but most other occupational travelers reported that being concerned about health issues related to travel had prompted them to make a pre-travel health appointment.
India was the top destination both for business (24%) and research/education (9%) travelers. China (7%) and South Africa (4%) were the other two most commonly visited destinations for business travelers. Although Haiti was selected by most of those providing medical care (20%) and missionaries (15%), Honduras was most common for non-medical service workers (14%). (It should be noted that a large earthquake occurred in Haiti in 2010 during the data collection period of this current study.)
Both business travelers and those providing medical care had the shortest trips (both medians 10 days). Most occupational travelers, including business travelers, planned on staying at hotels, except non-medical service workers who reported dorms/hostels as the most common planned accommodation.
More business travelers than leisure or VFR travelers were men (61% vs 43%; P < 0.0001) ( Table 2) . Business travelers had less time to departure than did leisure travelers (15 days vs 29 days; P < 0.0001) but were similar to VFR travelers (15 days vs 14 days; P ¼ 0.05 (Table 2) . For leisure and VFR travelers, being concerned about health issues related to travel (40% and 49%, respectively) was the most common reason for the pre-travel consultation. For business travelers, 25% reported being concerned about health issues related to travel as their reason for seeking pre-travel health consultation.
Business travelers traveled for shorter periods of time than did leisure travelers (10 days vs 14 days; P < 0.0001) or VFR travelers (10 days vs 30 days; P < 0.0001). Eighty-two percent of business travelers and 60% of leisure travelers chose a hotel as the most common type of accommodation, whereas more than 80% of VFR travelers reported staying in a home with relatives. Of note, VFR travelers had different top destination countries (Ghana, Ethiopia, and Nigeria) compared with both occupational and non-occupational groups. More business travelers reported travel to only urban areas than did leisure (67% vs 24%; P < 0.0001) and VFR (67% vs 45%; P < 0.0001) travelers (data not shown).
The proportion of business travelers with immunity (those with pre-existing immunity or vaccinated [if indicated] at the pretravel visit) was at least 90% for tetanus, hepatitis A, YF, and typhoid ( Fig. 1) . For leisure and VFR travelers, the proportion with immunity was at least 80% for tetanus, YF, and typhoid. Clinicians reported that 78% of business travelers had pre-existing immunity for MMR (28% of those who had pre-existing immunity were born before 1957) and an additional 11% received vaccination at the pretravel consultation. Thirty-eight percent of business travelers had pre-existing immunity to influenza, and an additional of 29% received vaccinations with the pre-travel visit. Only 60% of business travelers were vaccinated or considered immune to hepatitis B after the pre-travel consultation. At the pre-travel consultation, 40% of VFR travelers, 37% of business travelers, and 27% of leisure travelers received meningococcal vaccine. At the time of the visit, 22% of business, 18% of leisure and 17% of VFR travelers had (7) China 150 (7) Kenya 127 (9) Haiti 139 (11) Honduras 86 (9) South Africa 238 (4) Ghana 147 (6) Honduras 62 (4) Ghana 79 (6) Ghana 83 (9) (5) 60 (2) 197 (14) 215 (14) 148 (15) immunity to JE. Few business, leisure, or VFR travelers were considered immune to or vaccinated against rabies. Figure 2A and B outlines the reasons for non-vaccination among business, VFR, and leisure travelers. When compared with leisure and business travelers, a higher percentage of VFR travelers declined vaccines. Among those business travelers who were recommended the specific vaccine, 49% declined influenza vaccine, 41% MMR vaccine, 32% meningococcal vaccine, 19% hepatitis B vaccine, 15% rabies vaccine, and 12% JE vaccine. Thirty six percent of leisure and 69% of VFR travelers also declined MMR vaccine. Clinicians reported that influenza vaccine was unavailable for 22% of business, 19% of VFRs, and 21% of leisure travelers. For business travelers, clinicians reported insufficient time to complete the vaccine series for JE (23%), hepatitis A (11%), hepatitis B (10%), and rabies (10%). Based on current CDC criteria, clinicians considered hepatitis B, rabies, meningitis, polio, or JE vaccines not to be indicated for more than half of business or leisure travelers.
For those traveling to a country where malaria was a risk throughout, 91% of business, 90% of leisure, and 88% of VFR travelers were prescribed an anti-malarial medication. Of the 291 travelers who were not prescribed anti-malarial medication, 19 (7%) declined the medication and 17 (6%) had existing prescription from their primary care provider; there was no additional information for the other 255 (87%) travelers. Mefloquine was the most common prescription for VFR travelers (49%), and atovaquone/proguanil was most common among business (73%) and leisure (76%) travelers.
Our analysis shows that business travelers differ both from other occupational travelers and non-occupational travelers (leisure and VFRs). Business travelers are predominantly men, generally older, and seek pre-travel consultations largely on the advice of their employer. Compared with other travelers, business travelers receive pre-travel health care closer to their travel date, plan on hotel stays in urban areas, and travel for shorter durations. Although some business travelers received influenza (21%), meningococcal (37%), and hepatitis B (20%) vaccines with the visit, many business travelers (49%, 32%, and 19%, respectively) declined to receive them.
The demographic profiles of business and occupational travelers described here are similar to those found in other studies. In a study by Hill, and consistent with our findings, business travelers were younger than leisure travelers and older than those traveling for education or study. 14 Non-medical service (median 22 years) and research/education travelers (median 24 years) in our analysis were the youngest of all occupational travelers. Like our investigation, other studies have also found that business travelers are predominantly men. 14, 15 Within the occupational category, missionary and nonmedical service workers sought pre-travel advice at least a month ahead of their travel date. In contrast, only half of business travelers sought pre-travel advice within 2 weeks of travel; a finding also noted in previous research. 16 The need for business travel can occur suddenly, leading to shorter preparation time 17 ; however, business travelers may know about their trip further in advance than the timing of their pre-travel health appointment may indicate. In fact, the US Department of Commerce Office of Trade and Tourism found that people reporting travel for business and convention purposes planned their trip a median of 30 days in advance, and airline reservations were made a median of 21 days in advance. 2 It is not known from our analysis how far in advance travelers planned their itineraries or if there was a delay in seeking pre-travel health consultations after plans were finalized.
Seeking pre-travel care within 2 weeks of travel makes travelers less likely to complete or maximally benefit from recommended vaccine regimens; starting malaria chemoprophylaxis or filling other recommended prescriptions may also be compromised. In support of this, we found that GTEN clinicians reported insufficient time for some business travelers to complete the series of JE, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rabies vaccines. Travelers would benefit from having their pre-travel health consultations as soon as travel is booked to complete or follow accelerated vaccine schedules. Many companies make pre-travel health consultations mandatory during the airline ticket-issuing process. 16 Alternatively, if general business travel is anticipated, travelers should consider pre-emptive vaccination to ensure full coverage before last-minute travel. 17 Although GTEN does not collect information on risk perception, last minute travelers believe that their disease risk is lower. 18 Travelers should also consider the placement of their international worksites; because many facilities are located outside of cities, travelers and clinicians need to consider both urban and peri-urban exposures to mosquitoes, and thus mosquito-borne illnesses. Pre-travel health consultations sought well in advance ensures that proper risk assessments and guidance can be acted upon for each traveler's destination.
We found the median duration of travel for business travelers was 10 days, which was similar to US Department of Commerce Office of Trade and Tourism's finding of 8 days. 2 Other occupational travelers with shorter durations of stay included those providing medical care (10 days) and missionaries (11 days) . Both leisure travelers and VFRs had significantly longer stays of 14 and 30 days, respectively. All travelers, but especially short-term travelers, may not fully recognize the illness and injury risks associated with international travel. 4, 16 Business travelers often do not consider unexpected risks, such as those associated with unanticipated medical treatment or casual sexual activity. 19 In addition, business travelers often travel multiple times a year. 2 We did not collect information on the number of trips taken each year by the travelers; however, each trip can contribute to the risk of a travel-related illness. Clinicians seeing travelers should consider this cumulative risk assessment when advising business travelers and consider interventions, such as vaccinations, an investment for future trips. 7 The pre-travel health consultations described here increased the vaccination coverage for all of the vaccines and provided malaria prescriptions for most travelers, although several gaps still remain. Of particular interest, many business (49%), leisure (44%), and VFR (61%) travelers declined influenza vaccine. Despite high morbidity and mortality rates associated with influenza, a significant proportion of the US population chooses not to get vaccinated against the disease. 20 According to CDC estimates, only 42.8% of all people older than 2 years, and 48.4% of people with high-risk indications between the ages of 18 and 64 years were vaccinated against influenza in the 2010 to 2011 season. 21 A GeoSentinel analysis of returned ill travelers found that business travel was associated with influenza. 22 Further, a study of Swiss business travelers found that only 27% had their annual influenza vaccination. 23 In addition to reducing the risk of decreased productivity due to illness, increasing influenza vaccination coverage in travelers can prevent the translocation of disease back to coworkers in the United States. It is beneficial for employers to emphasize the importance of vaccination, especially influenza vaccine.
In our analysis, more than half of the business travelers were referred to the clinics by their employers. Although we were unable to elucidate whether travelers in our data set have employersponsored insurance or the employer was paying directly for the appointment and/or medications and vaccines, employers played a role in directing the travelers to the clinics. It is the traveler's responsibility to obtain pre-travel health advice, but employers also have a responsibility to ensure the well-being of their employees during and after business-related travel. This employer responsibility is not only to the travelers themselves, but also to employees who remain behind in the United States. Infections and injuries in business travelers not only negatively affect the travelers themselves but also have negative consequences for the business. Illness may disrupt business activities during or after travel, cause loss of time and productivity, and increase medical costs. 24 One study found higher rates of medical claims for almost all diseases categories after international travel by business travelers compared with their non-traveling colleagues; many claims were related to infectious diseases. 25 History has shown that diseases such as SARS, hepatitis A, measles, and tuberculosis have all been transmitted by individuals traveling for business and other occupational travelers [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ; and infections such as these may be transmitted to non-traveling employees or the traveler's community. It should be noted that occupational travelers and especially business travelers are more likely to visit Asia than VFRs or leisure travelers so the groups have different destination patterns and infectious disease risks. Although employers may shoulder the costs of the pre-travel health consultations, the costs of ill employees may be higher. 31 To prevent illness in travelers and the translocation of disease to employees in the United States, employers can increase the proportion of travelers seeking timely pre-travel care by developing corporate health strategies, providing travel-related health education to improve risk perceptions, planning trips ahead of time when possible, and allowing time for health consultations for travelers with short time to departures.
Our investigation has some limitations. GTEN data, although geographically distributed, may not be representative of the general traveling population, or business travelers in particular; however, our findings are consistent with those of other studies. We focused only on travelers who listed a single purpose of travel and therefore did not explore further those who listed multiple purposes of travel. In addition, purpose of travel was self-selected by travelers, and we focused specifically on those who chose business or other occupational or service as their purpose for travel. There was no additional information, such as whether the traveler received compensation, to support that these travelers were unquestionably occupational or non-occupational. We also recognize that our category of occupational travelers includes a number of sub-groups, which is the reason that we performed sub-analyses. Finally, because sub-national destination data were not available, we could only assess the suitability of malaria chemoprophylaxis recommendations in those traveling to countries where malaria was a risk throughout. Further, GTEN does not systematically collect information on patients who did not receive a prescription for malaria chemoprophylaxis; however, analysis of text fields provided limited information. Despite these limitations, our study is, to our knowledge, the largest analysis of detailed pre-travel health consultations prior to business and occupational-related travel, including data on over 9000 occupational travelers. In this era of large multinational corporations and outsourcing, our findings are of interest to businesses, and particularly to health care workers charged with caring for individuals whose work assignment involves international travel.
Business and occupational travel has repetitively been associated with illness not only among travelers themselves, but has also led to the importation of infectious diseases into home and work communities, and these importations often require costly work and public health responses. Business travelers have a distinct profile when compared with other occupational and non-occupational travelers. Employers play a role in encouraging business travelers to seek pre-travel health consultations. Such consultations, even if scheduled immediately before travel, can be an opportunity to identify vaccination gaps and to increase coverage to lessen the likelihood of illness among travelers and importation of pathogens into home and work communities.","Pre-Travel Medical Preparation of Business and Occupational Travelers: An Analysis of the Global TravEpiNet Consortium, 2009 to 2012","Khan, Nomana M.; Jentes, Emily S.; Brown, Clive; Han, Pauline; Rao, Sowmya R.; Kozarsky, Phyllis; Hagmann, Stefan H.F.; LaRocque, Regina C.; Ryan, Edward T.",J Occup Environ Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4697958/,100,3653,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study is undertaken to develop an efficient computational approach for timely encoding protein sequences and extracting the hidden information.
Methods: Based on two physicochemical properties of amino acids, a protein primary sequence was converted into a three-letter sequence, and then a graph without loops and multiple edges and its geometric line adjacency matrix were obtained. A generalized PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) model was thus constructed to characterize a protein sequence numerically.
Results: By using the proposed mathematical descriptor of a protein sequence, similarity comparisons among β-globin proteins of 17 species and 72 spike proteins of coronaviruses were made, respectively. The resulting clusters agreed well with the established taxonomic groups. In addition, a generalized PseAAC based SVM (support vector machine) model was developed to identify DNA-binding proteins. Experiment results showed that our method performed better than DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, iDNA-Prot and enDNA-Prot by 3.29-10.44% in terms of ACC, 0.056-0.206 in terms of MCC, and 1.45-15.76% in terms of F1M. When the benchmark dataset was expanded with negative samples, the presented approach outperformed the four previous methods with improvement in the range of 2.49-19.12% in terms of ACC, 0.05-0.32 in terms of MCC, and 3.82-33.85% in terms of F1M.
These results suggested that the generalized PseAAC model was very efficient for comparison and analysis of protein sequences, and very competitive in identifying DNA-binding proteins.","DNA-binding proteins (DNA-BPs) are very important functional proteins in a cell. These proteins play vital roles in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, regulation of gene expression, packaging, and other activities associated with DNA [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . It is therefore substantially important to distinguish DNA-BPs from non-DNA-binding proteins (NBPs). In the past, many experimental and computational techniques have been developed for identifying DNA-BPs. Experimental techniques can provide a clear-cut answer to a query protein. However, the experimental methods are cost-intensive and time-consuming, and thus impractical for large datasets [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Computational methods can be broadly divided into two categories: structure-based method and sequence-based *Address correspondence to this author at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571158, China; Tel: +86-898-65883210; E-mail: lichwun@163.com method. The former can discriminate DNA-binding and nonbinding proteins with high accuracy, but these methods can't be employed in high throughput annotation, as they require the structure information of a query protein [1] . Though tremendous progress has been achieved in experimental determination of protein structures in the past five decades, it can't keep pace with the explosive growth of sequence information resulting from modern sequencing technology [8] . Yet as suggested by Anfinsen [9] , proteins contain within their amino acid sequences enough information to determine their native conformation. Therefore, it is more promising to use sequence-based methods to identify DNA-BPs.
One of the core issues to the sequence-based methods is how to characterize protein sequences and harvest the fruits hidden in them. The most typical approach is using the amino acid composition (AAC) to formulate a protein sequence. Owing to its simplicity, the AAC model was widely applied in a number of earlier statistic-based methods. However, as pointed out in Ref [6] , if we denote by the counts of 20 standard amino acids in a protein sequence, then we can see that there are a total of different sequences/strings possessing the same AAC. The reason is that AAC model neglects the order relation among elements of a sequence. To overcome this drawback, the concept of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC, or Chou's PseAAC) was proposed [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The essence of PseAAC is that it not only covers AAC, but also contains additional order-correlated factors along a protein sequence. Another popular way for sequence analysis is to convert the protein primary sequence over 20 amino acids into a reduced one. The earliest and simplest reduction was the well-known HP model, in which 20 standard amino acids are divided into two types, hydrophobic (H) (or non-polar) and polar (P) (or hydrophilic). On the basis of the classic model, a detailed HP model was introduced by dividing the polar class into three subclasses: positive polar, uncharged polar and negative polar [19] . In addition, a few five-group classifications of amino acids were presented for practical purposes [20] [21] [22] [23] . By considering property-based triples, Li et al. [6] put forward a six-letter model of amino acids. Also based on three physical-chemical properties of amino acids, Yao et al. [24] mapped the 20 standard amino acids to eight vertices of a cube with the center of origin, and thus an eightgroup model of amino acids is obtained.
Motivated by the work mentioned above, we propose a generalized PseAAC which is grounded on a three-letter model and 2-D graphical representation of a protein sequence. We summarize the main work of this paper as follows: In section 2, we briefly introduce five datasets used in this study. In section 3, on the basis of two important physicochemical properties of amino acids, we cluster the 20 standard amino acids into three groups. By assigning to each group a representative symbol, we transform a protein sequence into a three-letter sequence. Then a 2-D graph without loops and multiple edges and its geometric line adjacency matrix are obtained. A sequence-derived feature vector of dimension (25+ ) is thus constructed to characterize a protein sequence. Our scheme is similar to, but obviously different from that of PseAAC. In section 4, we apply the presented feature vector to compare -globin proteins of 17 species and 72 spike proteins of coronaviruses respectively. Also, we develop a SVM (support vector machine) model using the generalized PseAAC to identify DNA-binding and non-binding proteins on three datasets. Experiment results show that the presented method outperforms the existing methods including DNAbinder [1] , DNA-Prot [2] , iDNA-Prot [3] and enDNA-Prot [4] . Finally, conclusions are given in section 5.
In this study, the following five datasets are used. For convenience, they are denoted by BetaSet, CoVSet, DNASet, DNAeSet and DNAiSet, respectively.
The dataset called BetaSet is composed of -globin protein of 17 species: Human (ALU64020), Gorilla (P02024), Chimpanzee (P68873), Cattle (CAA25111), Banteng (BAJ05126), Goat (AAA30913), Sheep (ABC86525), European hare (CAA68429), Rabbit (CAA24251), House mouse (ADD52660), Western wild mouse (ACY03394), Spiny mouse (ACY03377), Norway rat (CAA29887), Opossum (AAA30976), Guttata (ACH46399), Gallus (CAA23700), Muscovy duck (CAA33756). This dataset is used to determine the adjustable parameters in a feature vector.
This dataset consists of 72 spike proteins of coronaviruses (CoVs), 23 of which are MERS-CoVs, and 30 are SARS-CoVs. CoVs can be divided into three groups according to serotypes. Group alpha (formerly known as CoV-1) and group beta (formerly CoV-2) contain mammalian viruses, while group gamma (formerly CoV-3) contains only avian viruses. The name, accession number, and abbreviation of the 72 sequences are listed in Table 1 .
According to the existing taxonomic groups, sequences 1-5 belong to the first group, sequences 6-8 belong to the third group, and the remainings belong to the second group.
This is a benchmark dataset created in 2007 by Kumar et al. [1] . It contains 396 sequences, 146 of which are DNA-BPs (positive samples), and 250 NBPs (negative samples). In both the positive and the negative sets, the sequence similarity between any two proteins is not more than 25%.
This dataset was also generated by Kumar et al. [1] which is based on the work of Wang and Brown [25] . It originally contains 92 DNA-BPs and 100 NBPs. In order to avoid overestimating a given method, those sequences having sequence similarity with DNASet were removed by Xu et al. [4] , and the final dataset is composed of 82 DNA-BPs and 100 NBPs.
As an expanded benchmark dataset, DNAeSet was constructed in 2014 by Xu et al. [4] . According to a sequence filter criteria which is identical to DNASet, they added a number of NBPs to DNASet, and the total number of NBPs is 2125. By removing the sequence which has sequence identity with DNAiSet, the current version of DNAeSet has 146 DNA-BPs and 1710 NBPs.
Isoelectric point (pI) and relative distance (RD) are two important physicochemical properties of the 20 standard amino acids [26] [27] [28] . Their original numerical values are listed in Table 2 (relative distance) varies between 1469 and 3355. Therefore, the normalization of these values is needed. Here, we scale them into the interval [0,1] by the formulary below:
The corresponding values are listed in Table 3 . The last row in this table gives the average values.
For the i-th amino acid , if , then we label it by ""+"", otherwise we will label it by ""-"". Similarly, if property is considered, the second label for amino acid can be obtained. In this way, each of the 20 standard amino acids has a label pair. In Table 3 , the corresponding labels are also listed. Amino acids with a same label pair are viewed as members of a same group. Thus, the 20 standard amino acids are distributed to the following groups:
For each group, the first amino acid is used to stand for the group. Thus the three groups have three representative letters, they are A, C and H, respectively. The value for the property of a group is defined as the average value for the property of all members in the group. In the left-hand side of Table 4 , we list the corresponding values of the three groups. Obviously, each group can be viewed as a 2-D vector. In order to make the vectors of the three groups have unit length, we further normalize them to be unit vectors, and list the normalized values ( ) in the right-hand side of Table 4 .
In Fig. (1) , we show the 2-D map of the 20 standard amino acids according to the classification above.
By substituting each amino acid with its representative letter, a protein primary sequence is reduced into a threeletter sequence. For example, the three-letter sequence of the sequence segment EKAAVTGFWGKVKVDEVGAEA is AHAAAHCCCCHAHACAACAAA.
To obtain the graphical representation of a reduced sequence, we start from the origin (0,0) and move in xoy-plane in the direction dictated by Fig. (1) . In mathematics, one can let be a given three-letter sequence. And then one has a map , which maps S into a plot set. Explicitly, , and is given by where, T represents the transpose of a matrix, (j=1,2) represents the j-th component of the unit vector corresponding to (cf. Fig. 1 and Table 4 ). Connecting all points of the plot set in turn, a 2-D curve is drawn. In Fig.  (2) , we show the 2-D graphical representation of sequence AHAAAHCCCCHAHACAACAAA. It is not difficult to find that the 2-D graphical representation has no degeneracy, and thus is a simple graph, that is, a graph without loops and multiple edges. 
In this section, we give a numerical characterization of a protein sequence that will facilitate quantitative comparisons of protein sequences. As is known, once a graphical representation is given, it can be transformed into some structural matrices, such as the matrices ED, GD, M/M, and L/L [6, 24, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Here we employ the L/L matrix. L/L is a nonnegative symmetric matrix whose off-diagonal entries are defined as a quotient of the Euclidean distance between two vertices of the graph and the sum of geometrical lengths of edges between the two vertices. By definition all diagonal elements are zero. Obviously, the entries in a L/L matrix are less than or equal to one. The higher order k L/ k L matrix is the matrix whose (i,j)-entry is . As the exponent k approaches positive infinity, k L/ k L converges to a (0,1) matrix (denoted by b L/ b L). With respect to the proposed 2-D graph, [ b L/ b L] ij =1 if and only if the two corresponding vertices lie on a straight line in the curve, including the cases of adjacency and non-adjacency. In this sense, we call such a matrix a geometric line adjacency matrix (GLAM), or simply a generalized adjacency matrix (GAM), generated by a graph, and denote it by .
The first Zagreb index is a well-known vertex-degreebased molecular structure descriptor. This index was first time considered by Gutman and Trinajstic about 45 years ago, and since then discussed and used in numerous studies (see [38] [39] [40] and the references cited therein). The first Zagreb index is defined as (2) where du denotes the degree (=number of first neighbors) of the vertex u in graph G. If G is a simple graph (i.e. without loops and multiple edges), Z g1 can be also obtained directly from its adjacency matrix since the row-sums of this matrix are equal to degrees of the corresponding vertices.
It should be mentioned that the Zagreb index gives greater weights to inner vertices and edges than to outer vertices and edges of a graph [38] . One way to amend it is to insert inverse values of the vertex-degree into Eq(2), and thus the modified Zagreb index has been proposed [38] :
Clearly, m Z g1 gives greater weights to outer vertices/edges than to inner ones in a graph.
At the same time, on the basis of our geometric line adjacency matrix, we can count the vertex-pair with generalized adjacency relationship. It should be noted that, in our case, the 'neighbors' include not only the conventional neighbors, i.e. the first neighbors, but also the second neighbors, the third neighbors, and so on. We call the corresponding number of graph G a line-adjacency index, and denote it by La(G). Then we have a graph-based index:
For a symmetric matrix, eigenvalue-based indices, such as the leading eigenvalue [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] 35] and the graph energy [17] , are often used as the matrix invariants. Moreover, in our previous paper [41] , an alternative invariant called 'ALE-index' was proposed. The ALE-index is defined by the following formula: (4) where L is the order of the matrix, and are the m1-and F-norms of a matrix respectively. In order to reduce variations caused by comparison of matrices with different sizes, we consider a normalized ALE-index instead of . For convenience, we denote this matrixbased index by .
In addition, with respect to three-letter sequence , we define a coupling mode function by , (n=1, 2)
where P 1 and P 2 are values for properties of the corresponding representative letter (group), integer k represents the counted rank (or tier) of the coupling mode. Then, following the similar procedures in [10, 11] , we can extract global sequence-order information of the three-letter sequence S by , , .
where is called the k-th tier correlation factor. Clearly, reflects the coupling mode between the most contiguous elements along three-letter sequence S, is the coupling mode between the second most contiguous, the third most contiguous, and so forth.
Furthermore, if the respective counts of the three representative letters (A, C and H) in sequence S are , respectively, then we can obtain a so-called group composition (GC): where, denotes the size of a group (set).
Consequently, elements are derived, which reflect the information about the reduced sequence and, particularly, the 2-D graphical representation. By combining these elements with the conventional amino acid composition (AAC), a dimensional feature vector can be constructed to numerically characterize a protein sequence: ,
where (8) Here, are frequencies of occurrence of the 20 standard amino acids in a protein sequence, and are weight factors. As will be described later in detail, the four adjustable parameters in Eqs (7) and (8) can be determined by a set of known samples. Roughly speaking, the vector contains the feature of AAC, and the information beyond AAC as well, which is similar to Chou's PseAAC in form. Therefore, we call such a vector formulated by Eqs (7) and (8) the generalized PseAAC of a protein sequence.
In this section, we will discuss the use of the generalized PseAAC. As can be seen from Eqs (7) and (8), the present mathematical descriptor contains four uncertain parameters:
, w 1 , w 2 and w 3 . Here represents the total number of correlation ranks counted (cf. Eq(6)), which is an integer. Generally speaking, the greater the value of , the more sequence-order effects will be incorporated. However, if the value is too large, it might cause the overfitting problem or 'high dimension disaster' [15] , therefore, we endeavour to limit the value of to a small integer. In this study, the five datasets (BetaSet, CoVSet, DNASet, DNAeSet and DNAiSet) are arranged into two groups: one contains BetaSet, the other includes the rest. The first group is used for determining the four adjustable parameters, and the second group for testing purpose.
According to the method mentioned above, we first associate each of 17 protein sequences in BetaSet with a dimensional vector (cf. Eqs (7) and (8)), and then calculate the pair-wise Euclidean distance between any two of the 17 protein sequences via their m-D vectors. Thus a real symmetric matrix is obtained. On the basis of the achieved distance matrix , a UPGMA tree is constructed using MEGA4 package. The result will depend on values of the rank and the three weight factors. It is found that when , , and , the three non-mammals (Muscovy duck, Gallus and Guttata) form a separate branch and stay outside of the mammals. Moreover, in the subtree of mammals, primate species (Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla) are grouped closely. Also, rodent species (Norway rat, Spiny mouse, House mouse, Western wild mouse) and lagomorph species (Rabbit, European hare) are situated at independent branches, respectively. While Goat, Sheep, Cattle and Banteng appear to cluster together (Fig. 3) . This result is analogous to that reported in the literature [6, 29, 30, 35, 36] . Accordingly, the four numerical values are respectively used for the four uncertain parameters, and a 31-D feature vector is thus obtained. Fig. (3) . The relationship tree of 17 species.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we test it by phylogenetic analysis on the CoVSet dataset. Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the genus Coronavirus of family Coronaviridae [42] . The first coronavirus (HCoV-229E) was isolated from humans in 1965. Until 2003, coronaviruses attracted little interest beyond causing mild upper respiratory tract infections. However, this phenomenon changed dramatically with the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. As of July 2017, 2040 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in over 27 countries, and at least 710 individuals have died (crude CFR 34.8%) [43] .
Using the above-determined values for parameters , w 1 , w 2 , and w 3 , we calculate the 31-D feature vectors of 72 coronavirus spike proteins and their Euclidean distance matrix; then the corresponding phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4) is constructed. Observing Fig. (4) , we find that the 72 coronavirus spike proteins are clustered into three groups: one contains the five alpha coronaviruses (PEDVC, PEDV, TGEVG, TGEV, and HCoV-229E), the second includes the three gamma coronaviruses (IBV, IBVBJ, IBVC), and the third corresponds to the group beta. A closer look at the subtree of beta coronaviruses shows that MERS-CoVs are clearly clustered together, so it is with SARS-CoVs, while MHV, MHVA, MHVM, MHVP, MHVJHM, BCoV, BCoVE, BCoVL, BCoVM, BCoVQ and HCoV-OC43 are situated at an independent branch. The resulting cluster agrees well with the established taxonomic groups. 
To further assess the effectiveness of the porposed method, we conduct a series of experiments of identification of DNA-binding proteins on three datasets: DNASet, DNAeSet and DNAiSet. Among them, DNASet and DNAeSet serve as training datasets, while DNAiSet serves as an independent testing dataset. Support vector machine (SVM) is employed as the classifier, and R package 'e1071' v1.6-8 [44] is used to implement SVM. For a given set of binary-labeled training examples, SVM maps the input space into a higherdimensional space and seeks a hyperplane to separate the positive samples from the negative ones [25] . The optimal hyperplane maximizes the separation margin between the two classes of training data. The distance measurement between the data points in the high-dimensional space is defined by the kernel function. In this study, we use the radial basis function (RBF) kernel . This model involves two tunable parameters: the kernel width and the penalty parameter C. Prediction performance can be assessed using some quality indices including Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), Fmeasure (F1M) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) [2, 4, 5, 25, 37, 45] :
, , , .
where TP, TN, FP, and FN are defined as the numbers of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative samples obtained from the prediction respectively, while P and R denote Precision value and Recall value, respectively. One can also use the alternative definition by a series of studies published recently [15, [46] [47] [48] . The higher the values of these measurements, the better the quality of prediction.
This experiment is made on DNASet itself. To obtain a reliable result with few error, the SVM model on DNASet is established by 5-fold cross-validation (5CV) with 3 runs. Here the 31-D feature vector of a protein sequence serves as the input for SVM. In a 5CV, the positive and negative samples are randomly distributed into five subsets or the socalled folds, and the test is repeated five times. In each of the five iterations, one subset is used as the testing set, while the remaining four subsets are combined together and used to build a classifier (training). The predictions made for the test data instances in all the five iterations yield the final result. The sensitivity, specificity, ACC, MCC and F1M are calculated for each run, and the corresponding results and their average values are listed in Table 5 . As can be seen Fig. (4) . The relationship tree of 72 coronavirus spike proteins. T a lw a n T C 2 T a lw a n T C 1 T a lw a n T C 3 TW 1 TW 2 TW H TW J Urbani from this table, we achieve the accuracy (ACC) of 89.65%, with MCC of 0.776 and F1M of 84.91%. This result shows that our SVM model performs well on the benchmark dataset DNASet. 
It is important to examine the performance of the newly developed method on an independent dataset. In this experiment, we establish the classifier with the benchmark dataset DNASet and then test it on the independent dataset DNAiSet. To decide the parameter pair (γ, C), we utilize a systematic grid search for and , where integers i and j are in ranges [-3, 3] and [0, 3], respectively. It is find that and are the optimal values for DNASet. With the best pair (γ, C), DNAiSet is fed to the SVM. As a result, our model correctly predicts 68 out of 82 DNA-BPs and 92 out of 100 NBPs. The ACC arrives at 87.91%, with the MCC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1M of 0.756, 82.93%, 92.00% and 86.07%, respectively (see Table  6 ). This demonstrates that our SVM model performs equally well on independent dataset.
For convenience of comparison, results of some existing methods including DNAbinder [1] , DNA-Prot [2] , iDNA-Prot [3] and enDNA-Prot [4] are also listed in Table 6 . DNAbinder developed by Kumar et al. [1] can extract evolutionary information in form of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) from the corresponding protein sequence. PSSM-21 and PSSM-400 are two feature vectors generated by means of PSSM, whose dimensions are 21 and 400, respectively. In [1] , PSSM-400 based SVM model was mainly used for predicting DNA-BPs. DNA-Prot [2] is a Random Forest based method, in which the feature vector includes sequence information and structure information, such as the composition of 20 standard amino acids, composition of 10 amino acid groups, and secondary structure information predicted from a protein sequence. iDNA-Prot [3] constructs the feature vector via the grey model, and Random Forest is also used as the operation engine. EnDNA-Prot [4] is a predictor which encodes a protein sequence into a feature vector with dimension of 188 and adopts an ensemble classifier constructed with four types of machine learning classifiers. All these methods are tested on the same datasets to make an unbiased comparison with our method. Observing Table 6 , we can see that the current approach outperforms other methods by 3.29-10.44% in terms of ACC, 0.056-0.206 in terms of MCC, and 1. .76% in terms of F1M. This result indicates that our method achieves highly comparable performance. 
When the size of positive samples is comparable to that of negative samples, many machine learning algorithms should have better performance. However, in real life, the number of non-binding proteins is much greater than that of DNA-BPs, i.e., .
In this case, the frequency of NBPs is generally much greater than that of the binding ones in the predictions, that is, .
Eqs (10) and (11) lead to that the value of ACC defined by Eq (9) tends towards 1. To solve this problem, instead of using the definition of ACC in Eq (9), here we use the alternative definition [49, 50] :
. (12) In order to analyze the influence of the number of negative samples in a benchmark dataset on the predictive performance of the current method, we construct a series of subsets of DNAeSet and use them as training set in turn, while DNAiSet is always used as the testing set. Each subset contains all the 146 DNA-BPs and a part of NBPs in DNAeSet. In detail, if the set of NBPs in is denoted by , k=1, 2, ..., then consists of 250 NBPs randomly selected from DNAeSet. And is obtained by adding 50 NBPs to , until 1700 NBPs are contained in it. For each subset , k=1, 2, ..., 30, we develop the SVM model by 5CV with 3 runs. The results averaging over the three runs are given in Fig. (5) . From Fig. (5) we can see that the curves of ACC and acc visibly split with each other when n, the size of , is larger. With increasing of n, ACC increases rapidly, while acc tends to be steady. The value of ACC seems higher and higher on the surface, but it cannot correctly reflect the performance because it is nothing but a false appearance.
In order to show the advantage of their method, Xu et al. [4] created a dataset called expanded benchmark dataset1100 with all the 146 positive samples and 1100 negative samples in DNAeSet, which is employed as another training dataset to evaluate the predictive performance on the independent dataset DNAiSet. For convenience of comparison, we also select the expanded benchmark dataset to establish the classifier and test it on DNAiSet. Repeating this procedure five times, the average results are given in Table 7 (the first row). Results obtained by the other four methods (DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, iDNA-Prot and enDNA-Prot) trained on the expanded benchmark dataset with n=1100 are also listed in Table 7 . From this table we see that the overall accuracy of our method is about 92%, with MCC of 0.84 and F1M of 91.24%, which outperforms other methods with improvement in the range of 2.49-19.12% in terms of ACC, 0.05-0.32 in terms of MCC, and 3.82-33.85% in terms of F1M. This suggests that our method performs well on unbalanced datasets. 
Based on two important physicochemical properties, 20 standard amino acids were distributed into three groups, and to each of which a representative symbol was assigned. By replacing each amino acid with its representative letter, a protein primary sequence was converted into a three-letter sequence, which can be viewed as a coarse-grained description of the protein primary sequence. On the basis of the three-letter sequence, a graph without loops and multiple edges was obtained. By taking the advantage of the 2-D graph, we constructed a geometric line adjacency matrix (GLAM) and then the corresponding ALE-index, the lineadjacency index, the first Zagreb index and its modification were calculated. In addition, order-correlated factors were extracted via the reduced sequence. By combining these elements with the frequencies of occurrence of 20 standard amino acids and their three representative letters, a generalized PseAAC model of a protein sequence was constructed. On five popular datasets, the proposed method was tested by phylogenetic analysis and identification of DNA-binding proteins. The results illustrated the better performance of our method.

39,13b16688b86661a6165f9c688c4f45893b7e47c5,"Adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (FOXP3 + Tregs) has been developed as a potential curative immune therapy to prevent and treat autoimmune and graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD). A major limitation that has hindered the use of Treg immunotherapy in humans is the difficulty of consistently isolating and obtaining highly purified Tregs after ex vivo expansion. Methods: We isolated bona fide Tregs from expansion cultures based on their selective surface expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP). The TCR Vβ diversity and intracellular cytokine production of Tregs were determined by flow cytometer. The TSDR methylation was determined by epigenetic human FOXP3 qPCR Assay. Their in vitro and in vivo potency was confirmed with suppression assay and humanized xenogeneic GVHD (xGVHD) murine model, respectively. Results: LAP + repurification results in >90% LAP + FOXP3 + Tregs, leaving behind FOXP3 − and FOXP3 + nonTregs within the LAP − population. After 4-week expansion, the LAP + Tregs were >1 billion cells, highly suppressive and anergic in vitro, >90% demethylated in the TSDR and able to maintain TCR Vβ diversity. In the xGVHD model, exogenous CD25 − PBMC administered alone results in a median survival of 32 days. The co-transfer of LAP + Tregs increased median survival to 47 days, while the LAP parent (CD25 + ) and LAP − nonTregs had median survival of 39 and 31 days, respectively. Conclusions: These preclinical data together provide evidence that LAP + Tregs are highly purified with fully suppressive function for cell therapy. This population results in a more effective and safer product for immunotherapy to treat GVHD and provides the necessary preclinical data for transition into a clinical trial with LAP + Tregs to prevent or treat GVHD and other autoimmune diseases.","FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of CD4 + T cells, maintain immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity by suppressing auto-reactivity and regulating immune responses to foreign and self-antigens [1] . A hallmark of Tregs is their expression of the transcription factor, FOXP3, and the high level of CD25, the IL2 receptor alpha chain [2] . Due to their role in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance, Tregs have been considered as potentially immunotherapy to prevent a variety of immunological diseases in human. Among potential diseases that may be tackled with such immune-modulators are most graft versus host disease (GVHD), a frequent and often severe complication following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [3] . Murine studies have demonstrated convincing evidence of the power of Tregs as a cell therapy to prevent and treat various Ivyspring International Publisher immunological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, GVHD, inflammatory bowel disease and lupus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In translating these studies to human therapeutic applications, one major limitation is the expansion of Tregs ex vivo to achieve consistently sufficient number and purity of bona fide Tregs. In the peripheral blood of healthy adults, there are ~5-10% FOXP3 + Tregs within total CD4 + T cells. Since FOXP3 is an intracellular transcription factor, only the CD4 + T cells with low CD127 and high CD25 expression, i.e., no more than 2-4% can be sorted to functionally isolate >90% FOXP3 purity. However, this population is not homogeneously Tregs, particularly in diseases where these markers are less correlative due to activated T cells. It has been established that there are two subsets of Tregs: those developed in the thymus (tTregs) and those generated in the periphery (pTregs). Moreover, naïve CD4 + T cells can be induced in vitro with TCR stimulation in the presence of TGFβ1 and IL2 to express FOXP3 (iTregs) [11] . The functional patterns for these different subgroups of Tregs are widely varying during the expansion of Tregs over a [3] [4] week period. In addition, the purity and composition of Tregs frequencies with respect to tTregs, iTregs, pTregs and CD4 + FOXP3 − nonTregs are also varying, resulting in an impure Treg product.
We have demonstrated previously that iTregs lack the cardinal features of tTregs based on anergy and suppressive function [11] . While >90% FOXP3 + cells can be isolated by FACS-sorting, frequently the percentage of FOXP3 + T cells decreases to 75% after two weeks and 50% after three weeks of expansion [12] [13] [14] . Due to these limitations that have hindered the advancement of Treg analysis and therapy, we have developed an innovative technique to repurify Tregs from expanded cultures contaminated with activated nonTregs. By targeting the selective expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP), this novel method allows for expansion and consistent re-purification of sufficient quantity of highly purified, bona fide Tregs (>90% FOXP3), even from an initial limited blood volume of 5-10 ml [15] . Without this technique, it has been difficult to analyze and assess definitively the function of Tregs due to variable contaminants of nonTregs. Moreover, this method has the potential to optimize Treg therapy by permitting the manufacturing of a Treg product that is consistently >90% bona fide Tregs regardless of methods of expansion or donor's variability. Using the LAP marker, we can selectively isolate LAP + Tregs from any time point during expansion that are typically contaminated by >25% FOXP3 + and FOXP3 -nonTregs. This purity and selectivity will allow for separation of different subsets and definitive determination of Tregs function in GVHD. Another important factor is the cost effectiveness for production of a Treg product. In this study, we use CD25 + cells isolated from buffy coats with anti-CD25 microbeads. These CD25 + cells are expanded with OKT3-loaded KT64/86 artificial APC (aAPC) expressing CD86 and CD64 and re-purified based on LAP expression. We perform an analysis of the TCR repertoire, function, and phenotype within CD25 + cells and the subsets of LAP + Tregs and LAP − nonTregs isolated from expansion cultures. We demonstrate that LAP + Tregs after 4-week ex vivo expansion still maintain diverse TCR Vβ repertoire, are highly demethylated in the TSDR region, and possess suppressive function. In contrast, the LAP − nonTregs possess no suppressive function, while the CD25 + parent population had variable functionality depending on the level of expanded, contaminated nonTregs.
Our study demonstrates a simple single-step CD25 + isolation, robust expansion on aAPCs, and LAP + repurification to obtain highly purified, bona fide FOXP3 + Tregs. Ultimately, clinical investigators can apply our techniques to further define Tregs in patients with other immunologic conditions and generate highly purified Treg products for therapeutic use. A highly purified Treg product after ex vivo expansion would not only reduce any potential adverse reactions but would also enhance the efficacy and interpretability of multi-center clinical trials on Treg immunotherapy.
Various fluorescent conjugated antibodies to human CD4 (RPA-T4), CD8 (RPA-T8), CD16 (3G8), CD19 (HIB19), CD25 (BC96), LAP (TW4-2F8) and GARP (7B11) were from BioLegend. Cells were surface stained first using appropriate combinations of mAbs, and either used directly for flow cytometric analyses or further processed for intracellular staining of cytokines, FOXP3 and HELIOS. The cells were fixed and permeabilized with a Fixation/ Permeabilization kit (eBioscience) and stained with anti-FOXP3 (259D) and/or anti-HELIOS (22F6) mAbs (BioLegend). FACSCalibur and Attune flow cytometers were used for data acquisition, and the data were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Anti-CD4, anti-biotin, anti-CD25 and anti-CD14 magnetic microbeads were from Miltenyi Biotec. All cells were cultured in complete media consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), 1×GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 1% MEM non-essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate (Hyclone).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from adult peripheral buffy coats (Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center) by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Tregs were purified from PBMC by positive selection using directly conjugated anti-CD25 magnetic microbeads with AutoMACS (Posseld2 program).
Bead-purified CD4 + CD25 high cells (~5-10×10 6 ) were stimulated with OKT3-loaded KT64/86 artificial APC (aAPC) expressing CD86 and CD64 at 1:1 ratio (kindly provided by Dr. Carl H. June and Dr. James L. Riley). KT64/86 cells were loaded with anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3, BioLegend). CD4 + CD25 high cells were cultured in complete media supplemented with 100 U/mL IL2 (PeproTech) in the presence of 25 nM rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were cultured in 25-cm 2 culture flasks (ThermoFisher Scientific). On day 5, the cells were transferred to 75-cm 2 culture flasks with additional fresh complete media containing 100 U/mL IL2. No additional rapamycin was added to the cultures except for the first day. On day 8, the cells were transferred to 175-cm 2 culture flasks with fresh IL2 media. The cultures were maintained at cell concentration of 10 6 /mL and split every 3 days with additional fresh IL2 media. On day 10, the cells were spun down and given fresh IL2 media before re-stimulation with additional OKT3 loaded KT64/86 at 6:1 of cell: aAPC. After 48-hour stimulation, the cells were analyzed and purified based on the expression of LAP. For LAP + cells isolation, biotinylated anti-hLAP mAbs (TW4-2F8, BioLegend) followed by secondary incubation with anti-biotin magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotecs) were used. LAP + Tregs were purified from expanded CD25 + cells by positive selection with AutoMACS (Posseld2 program). The CD25 + , LAP + and LAP − populations were cultured in fresh IL2 media and maintained at cell concentration of 10 6 /mL, splitting every 3 days with additional fresh IL2 media. On day 20, these populations got the 3 rd stimulation with OKT3-loaded KT64/86 cells at 6:1 ratio.
CD4 + CD25 − and CD14 + cells were isolated from PBMC of healthy donor buffy coats using the AutoMACS and related Miltenyi Biotecs kits. Fresh CD4 + CD25 − T cells (50,000) were labeled with 2 μM CFSE (Invitrogen) and stimulated with non-irradiated CD14 + APC (12,500) loaded with 0.25 μg/mL OKT3 alone or with 2:1, 4:1, 8:1 and 16:1 responder to suppressor cells (CD25 + , LAP + Tregs or LAP − cells). The cells were cultured for 4 days in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Corning), and CFSE dilution was analyzed by FACS.
For analysis of intracellular cytokine production, the cells were stimulated for 5 hours with 50 ng/mL PMA, 1 μg/mL ionomycin and 3 μg/mL brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich). Afterward, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with eBioscience FOXP3 kit and stained with mAbs against FOXP3 (259D), IL2 (MQ1-17H12), IL4 (8D4-8), IL10 (JES3-9D7), IL13 (JES10-5A2), IL17A (BL168) and IFNγ (4S.B3) (BioLegend) for FACS analysis.
NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and maintained in specific pathogen free conditions at the CLAMC (University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston). In this protocol, the mice were not irradiated. On day 0, mice were injected with human CD25 − PBMC (30×10 6 ) with or without expanded CD25 + , LAP + Tregs and LAP‾ nonTregs (30×10 6 ). Following injection of cells, animals were monitored twice a week for weight loss and other signs of xGVHD, e.g. hunched back, ruffled fur and reduced mobility [16, 17] . Mice were euthanized if they experienced >15% weight loss or showed signs of compromised health and were considered to have human graft-related disease if an expanded population of human cells was detected simultaneously in blood. Mice were evaluated for human cells in blood by flow cytometer weekly until day 70 or until they were euthanized. To document CD25 − PBMC-associated cell expansion, the animals were bled (10-40 μl) and red blood cells were lysed with ACK Lysing Buffer (Quality Biological, Inc.). All animal protocols were approved by CLAMC at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.
To determine the methylation status of the Foxp3 gene, DNA was purified from frozen aliquots of expanded CD25 + , LAP + Tregs and LAP -nonTregs. Coded samples were sent to Epiontis (Berlin, Germany) for bisulfite modification and quantification of TSDR methylation by epigenetic human FOXP3 qPCR Assay.
T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ repertoire was analyzed using flow cytometry with the IOTest Beta Mark TCR Repertoire Kit (Beckman Coulter), which consists of fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies that identify 24 TCR Vβ subfamilies, covering about 70% of the normal human Vβ T cell repertoire.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student's t test. All group results are expressed as mean plus or minus SEM, if not stated otherwise. The paired Student's t test was used for the comparison of group values and discriminatory parameters, where appropriate. Survival data was analyzed with SPSS software (version 16.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a Log-rank Test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
Previously, we have demonstrated that it is feasible and economical to use an initial one-step method with anti-CD25 bead to purify and expand Tregs with anti-CD3/CD28 beads [15] . This time we use aAPCs, because they are more cost-effective at large scale production and do not require a removal process. Figure 1A shows the expansion and re-isolation protocol. Instead of previously isolating for LAP + Tregs at day 21 (3 rd round of stimulation), this time we isolate LAP + Tregs on the 2 nd round of stimulation at day 12. We choose this approach to reduce the amount of anti-LAP mAbs, since the cell numbers in the cultures are less. With this method, the CD25 + population contains an average of 72% FOXP3 + cells within CD4 + cells (range, 60%-84%), while the percentages of FOXP3 purity post LAP purification (LAP + ) are typically ≥90%. The LAPpopulation still has some FOXP3 + Tregs left. Furthermore, the LAP + cells are mainly GARP + cells ( Figure 1B) . Starting with 4-25×10 6 LAP + Tregs at day 12, we are able to achieve >1 billion LAP + Tregs by day 30 of expansion ( Figure  2A ). The starting CD25 + population at day 0 contains mainly CD4 + FOXP3 + Tregs with the remainder being CD8 + T, CD19 + B and CD16 + NK cells ( Figure 2B and S1). During the expansion, these contaminating non-T cells disappeared by day 10. Furthermore, the CD8 + T cell population is mainly found in the LAPpopulation after repurification ( Figure 2B ). There is a progressive reduction of FOXP3 purity in CD25 + population during the expansion from an average of 60% (range, 36%-74%) at the starting point to a mean of 73% (range, 46%-88%) on day 10 and 52% (range, 21%-87%) on day 30. After LAP repurification, the means of CD4 + FOXP3 + T cells maintain higher than 90% in LAP + Tregs and lower than 40% in LAPpopulation during expansion ( Figure 2C and D) . The mean percentages of FOXP3 + HELIOS + T cells maintain higher than 80% in LAP + Tregs and lower than 40% in LAPpopulation during expansion ( Figure 2C and E).
In order to investigate the changes in TCR Vβ repertoire during expansion, we next examine TCR repertoire usage of the Tregs (CD4 + FOXP3 + ) before (day 0) and after (day 30) expansion. After three rounds of stimulation and LAP purification, the total Treg TCR Vβ usages are essentially unchanged between Day 0 and Day 30 ( Figure 3A and B) . Figure  3C shows data from three representative donors for TCR Vβ distribution before and after expansion. 
Effector cells that secrete cytokines can exacerbate GVHD [18] . A cardinal feature of Tregs is their anergic state. The CD25 + , LAP + Tregs and LAP -nonTregs are stimulated to measure the levels of cytokine production at day 30 end of culture. There are substantially lower percentages of IL2 + , IFNγ + , IL17A + , IL4 + , IL13 + and IL10 + producing cells out of CD4 + cells detected in the LAP + Tregs as compared to the other two populations (Figure 4 and S2) .
The level of methylation at the promoter region upstream of FOXP3 termed Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) has provided specific differentiation between activated T effector cells and bona fide Tregs [19, 20] . Several studies have demonstrated that FOXP3 − cells are fully methylated at this site, while iTregs are intermediate and tTregs are fully demethylated [21, 22] . The level of demethylation at the TSDR region is critical for establishment of a stable Treg lineage and correlation with suppressive function. In this study, we demonstrate that after 30 days expansion the purified LAP + Tregs are highly demethylated with an average of 95% demethylation in the TSDR region, while the CD25 + cells with mean of 45% demethylation ( Figure  5A ). The LAP -nonTregs are highly methylated, with less than 20% demethylation even when the population contains close to 60% FOXP3 + and HELIOS + cells ( Figure 5B and C). It should be noted that the LAPpopulations still contain LAP + cells ranging from 10-50% which represent most of the demethylated TSDR and HELIOS signals (Figure 1 and 2).
Previously we have demonstrated that LAP + Tregs isolated from CD3/CD28 Dynabead stimulated expansion cultures maintained suppressive function. Since these LAP + Tregs are obtained from aAPC stimulated expansion cultures, it is important to confirm their suppressive function. We evaluate the capacity of purified LAP + Tregs to suppress the proliferative responses of CD4 + 25 − T cells in CFSE dilution assays. As expected, LAP + Tregs are the most potent suppressors among these three populations ( Figure 6A and B) .
To determine whether expanded LAP + Tregs are effective in suppressing human CD25-depleted PBMC-induced xenogeneic GVHD, we used a xenogeneic model of GVHD in which Tregs are co-transferred at a 1:1 ratio with allogeneic CD25-depleted PBMC (30 × 10 6 each) into NSG recipients to compare the potency and safety of in vitro-expanded LAP + Tregs and LAP − cells ( Figure  6C ). CD25 − PBMC administered alone results in a median survival of 32 days. The co-transfer of LAP parent (CD25 + ) or LAP + Tregs increased median survival to 39 (p < 0.05) and 47 days (p < 0.001), respectively. The LAP − nonTregs showed similar median survival (31 days) with PBMC group. The survival of LAP + group was significantly higher than LAP − group (p < 0.001). Compared with CD25 + group, LAP + Tregs increased median survival from 39 to 47 days. However, no statistic different was found, since some of the CD25 + parent populations have less contaminating nonTregs and therefore higher level of FOXP3 + Tregs ( Figure 2D, 5B) . Average body weight (% of initial weight) for mice surviving on given day for different groups was shown in Figure S3 .
Adoptive transfer of FOXP3 + Tregs to prevent or cure multiple autoimmune diseases or GVHD has proven to be highly efficacious in animal models and human [23] [24] [25] . But a major obstacle to overcome is to achieve a consistent and highly purified FOXP3 + Treg product after ex vivo expansion in a cost-effective manner. In this study, we use LAP as a unique cell surface marker that distinguishes bona fide Tregs from activated FOXP3 + and FOXP3 − nonTregs and show that it is feasible to sort expanded FOXP3 + Tregs from nonTregs based on expression of LAP. We obtain a post-sort FOXP3 purity of greater than 90% which would be ideal for cellular immunotherapy. Furthermore, we find that ex vivo expanded LAP + Tregs with aAPCs maintain TCR Vβ repertoire diversity, instead of clonal expansion due to selective cell death. Similar data has been detected in expanded cord blood (CB) Tregs: the process of ex vivo expansion did not skew the CB Tregs TCR Vβ repertoire [26] . Although it is possible to obtain a highly purified FOXP3 + population after re-stimulation of the expanded CD25 hi cells, it has also been shown that the effector T cells can transiently possess this feature, particularly after repeated in vitro stimulation [27] . Moreover, several studies have pointed out the potential plasticity of Tregs and caution that this instability could result in the generation of pathogenic memory T cells in vivo [28] . In our study, a quantitative assay to assess the anergic state of Tregs is used to detect the cytokine secretion. Only minimal percentages of IL2, IFNγ, IL17, IL4, IL13 and IL10 are detected in the purified LAP + Tregs as compared to CD25 + and LAP‾ population. This method offers the opportunity to reduce most of the cytokine secreting cells in our culture compared with rapamycin culture system, which still has >50% of cells secreting IL4 (both FOXP3 + and FOXP3 − cells) after the fourth re-stimulation [4] . In this study, only minimal percentages of LAP + Treg cells secrete IL-10. While the LAP + cells are mainly GARP + cells, the immunosuppressive role of LAP + might be through GARP/LAP complexes. Glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP), also known as leucine rich repeat containing 32 (LRRC32), plays important role in immunosuppressive function of Tregs by inhibiting T effector cell activity [29] . Targeting GARP by siRNA or monoclonal antibodies specific for GARP inhibit immunosuppressive activity of Treg in vitro and in vivo [30, 31] . However, the role of LAP/GARP on Tregs remains unclear and controversial. Deletion of GARP on mouse Tregs is not sufficient to inhibit the growth of transplanted tumors. They found the suppressive function of Tregs was not affected by knockout of garp in Tregs [32] . Further studies are needed to reveal the mechanisms responsible for suppressive function of LAP + Tregs.
Tregs represent a heterogeneous population comprised of a committed lineage and an uncommitted subpopulation with developmental plasticity [33] . Therefore, it is crucial to certify that the final Treg products consist of a committed Treg lineage and possess a stable phenotype with the highest purity as possible. A reliable method is the quantification of demethylation in the TSDR, which correlates positively with Treg phenotype and function. This epigenetic marker is highly specific for Tregs and can discriminate them from activated FOXP3 + conventional T cells [34, 35] . When compared with LAP + Tregs, significant levels of FOXP3 TSDR methylation are demonstrated in the LAP − nonTregs. Even after 30 days expansion, the purified LAP + Tregs are highly demethylated in the TSDR region. Some of the LAP − populations contain over 40% FOXP3 + cells, yet they have <20% TSDR demethylation, supporting that these FOXP3 + cells are not bona fide Tregs.
Adoptive transfer of LAP + Tregs delayed the development of xenogeneic GVHD. Our finding supports a prior observation showing that GARP + Treg protect from xGVHD. Dr. Lucas group found that the administration of antibody blocking GARP or GARP/TGF-β1 abrogate the protection of Tregs in xGVHD [31] . While we are able to demonstrate the suppressive function of LAP + Tregs, these assays have limitations. Although the LAP + Tregs demonstrate suppressive function by delaying the development of xenogeneic GVHD, we are unable to detect their existence in peripheral blood and spleens of the NSG mice by day 14 post adoptive transfer. Similar to our finding, Parmar et al. have previously shown that ex vivo-expanded cord blood Tregs in NSG xenogeneic model did not persist beyond day 3 [26] . One possible explanation might be due to cytokine deprivation, particularly IL2. Enhancing the stability of LAP + Tregs is critical for the development of an efficacious cell therapy. At this point, we are unclear whether their lack of persistence is intrinsic to the human Tregs or extrinsic due to the absence of critical growth factors compatible with human Tregs in the NSG mice. Further studies are needed to answer these two issues.
In the absence of a repurification process, the final expanded Treg product would have highly variable content of bona fide Tregs and contaminated, expanded nonTregs ( Figure 2D ). To address this issue, other protocols have implemented rapamycin which has improved the percentage of Tregs, but variability still exists [15, 36] . Consistent with other studies, some of our expanded CD25 + populations maintained >75% FOXP3 + and >60% TSDR demethylation ( Figure 5B ). These CD25 + populations did possess sufficient suppressive function similar to the repurified LAP + Tregs ( Figure 6A, C) . We were unable to demonstrate a statistical difference between CD25 + populations and LAP + Tregs due to the high variability in Treg percentage within some of the CD25 + populations. Therefore, it would be prudent to manufacture highly purified Treg immunotherapy, similar to the standard required for conventional drug manufacturing. Regardless of the variability in bona fide Tregs within the final product, implementing LAP repurification would normalize and produce a highly purified and more homogenous Treg product.
Overall, our study provides greater characterizations of LAP + Tregs to support their therapeutic application for GVHD and other autoimmune conditions. Regardless of the methods and strategies used to expand Tregs, co-expansion of other cells, particularly FOXP3 + nonTregs, is almost inevitable. With the application of LAP or GARP repurification, a highly purified, TSDR demethylated Treg population can be achieved which maintains diversity and functionality. The next step is to demonstrate their safety, stability and functionality in a human clinical trial.",Human LAP(+)GARP(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells attenuate xenogeneic graft versus host disease,"Wang, Huihui; Song, Hyo; Pham, Anha V.; Cooper, Laurence J.; Schulze, Janika J.; Olek, Sven; Tran, Dat Q.",Theranostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6531299/,285,3905,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intraspecies genomic diversity of the single-strand RNA (+) virus species hepatitis A virus (Hepatovirus), hepatitis C virus (Hepacivirus), and hepatitis E virus (Orthohepevirus) was compared. These viral species all can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis), but share no gene similarity. The codon usage of human hepatitis A virus (HAV) is suboptimal for replication in its host, a characteristic it shares with taxonomically related rodent, simian, and bat hepatitis A virus species. We found this codon usage to be strikingly similar to that of Triatoma virus that infects blood-sucking kissing bugs. The codon usage of that virus is well adapted to its insect host. The codon usage of HAV is also similar to other invertebrate viruses of various taxonomic families. An evolutionary ancestor of HAV and related virus species is hypothesized to be an insect virus that underwent a host jump to infect mammals. The similarity between HAV and invertebrate viruses goes beyond codon usage, as they also share amino acid composition characteristics, while not sharing direct sequence homology. In contrast, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus are highly similar in codon usage preference, nucleotide composition, and amino acid composition, and share these characteristics with Human pegivirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus. We present evidence that these observations are only partly explained by differences in nucleotide composition of the complete viral codon regions.
We consider the combination of nucleotide composition, amino acid composition, and codon usage preference suitable to provide information on possible evolutionary similarities between distant virus species that cannot be investigated by phylogeny.","hepatitis B virus). Despite their shared replication strategy, host specificity and tissue tropism, HAV, HCV, and HEV share very little sequence conservation, indicative of their independent evolutionary origins. We compared the genome sequences of a large number of these three viral species to evaluate commonalities and differences between and within the respective clades.
The genome of HAV is approximately 7.5 kb long and encodes a polyprotein that is processed into four structural and six nonstructural proteins by a proteinase (recently reviewed in McKnight & Lemon, 2018) . In lack of the cap assembly that is common in other RNA virus species, translation of HAV is initiated by a secondary structure formed by the 5′-untranscribed region of the RNA genome, which functions as a ribosome entry site (McKnight & Lemon, 2018; Vaughan et al., 2014) . Of note is that the codon use of HAV is quite distinct from that of its host, a property that is also reflected by its low GC content (37%); as a consequence, this virus is slow to replicate in human cells. The virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and the relative high stability of unenveloped virus particles in the environment enables transmission via fecally contaminated food and water. Yearly, approximately 1.5 million clinical cases of HAV occur globally, although at least ten times as many new undocumented infections may occur, as suggested by serological evidence (reviewed in Vaughan et al., 2014 ). The infection is mostly self-limiting and results in lifelong immunity.
In contrast, infection with HCV is often chronic, and this parentally transmitted virus is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease. It is responsible for approximately 180 million infections worldwide, with 3 million new infections occurring annually (Preciado et al., 2014) . The virus can be transmitted via unsafe medical practices including blood transfusions and needle reuse. As a result, developing countries present higher incidences than developed countries, with vast differences between countries (reviewed in Ansaldi, Orsi, Sticchi, Bruzzone, & Icardi, 2014) . The genome of HCV is about 9.6 kb, has a GC content of 56% and codes for a polypeptide that after processing results in 10 mature proteins.
Hepatitis E virus is the latest discovered virus of the three species considered here, but it actually is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis in humans (Kamar et al., 2017) , with an estimated 20 million novel infections worldwide, of which 3 million are symptomatic and around 70,000 are lethal; these may be underestimates, even in developed countries (Webb & Dalton, 2019) . Hepatitis E virus is spread via the fecal-oral route as well as by animal contact or via contaminated food of animal origin; parenteral transmission has also been described. Most infections are self-limiting. The genome of HEV is 7.2 kb with a GC content of 56%, and the 5′-untranscribed region is capped. The ssRNA(+) genome encodes a large polypeptide of which it is uncertain whether it is active as such or first processed into separate proteins with distinct functions, and 2 shorter proteins, translated from partly overlapping open reading frames (recently reviewed in Primadharsini, Nagashima, & Okamoto, 2019) .
All three viral species are subdivided into genotypes and subtypes therein, based on hypervariable regions of their genomes. For HAV, three genotypes that infect humans (I, II and II, each with subtypes A and B) are recognized, and these belong to a single serotype. Three more genotypes are specific to the simian host (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2003) , while a previously described genotype VII is reclassified as IIB. A substitution rate of 9.76 × 10 -4 substitutions per site per year (ssy) was calculated, based on complete VP1 sequences from French genotype IA isolates (Moratorio et al., 2007) , but this may be an overestimate, as an analysis of complete genome sequences from multiple countries produced an estimate of 1.00 × 10 -4 ssy (Kulkarni, Walimbe, Cherian, & Arankalle, 2009 ). Thus, the range is likely to be around one in ten thousand substitutions per site per year, or roughly one or two substitutions per viral genome per year. This reflects the slow evolutionary rate of this virus. A last common ancestor of human HAV and the simian genotypes was estimated to have existed between 1,250 and 3,500 years ago (Kulkarni et al., 2009 ).
However, human HAV is presumed to have originated from a rodent virus as a result of a host jump (Dexler et al., 2015) .
The genomic variation of HCV is much more extensive than that of HAV. HCV is subdivided in at least 7 major genotypes, with multiple subtypes therein (Simmonds et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2014) . Genetic diversity between the HCV genotypes is about 30%, while subtypes within a given genotype differ by 15%-25% (Hartlage, Cullen, & Kapoor, 2016; Preciado et al., 2014) . The different genotypes roughly coincide with geographical distribution, with genotypes 1, 2, and 3 being globally detected; genotypes 4 and 5 are more prevalent in Africa and the Middle East, and genotype 6 is found in Southeast Asia, as is reviewed elsewhere (Ansaldi et al., 2014) . The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of HCV lacks proof-reading activity, resulting in a high mutational rate of 10 -5 -10 -4 nucleotides per replication cycle (Duffy, Shackelton, & Holmes, 2008) , thus producing a heterogenic quasi-species population within infected individuals. Estimates for individual nucleotides produced a substitution rate of between 1.40 and 1.72 × 10 −3 ssy (Takahashi et al., 2004) , which is 10 times higher than that of HAV.
Hepacivirus species have now also been isolated from dogs, horses, and other mammals, which poses the possibility that HCV originated from a nonprimate host. In particular, a virus replicating in the equine host might have either made a natural host jump or it may have been aided by medical practices with horse-derived products (Hartlage et al., 2016) .
There are currently 8 recognized genotypes within HEV (Smith et al., 2016) , of which genotypes 1 and 2 are exclusively found in humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 are shared between humans and other mammalian hosts, in particular pig/wild boar and rabbits.
Genotypes that have not been described in humans but are isolated from other mammals (e.g., camels) are not considered here. The substitution rate of HEV was estimated between 3 and 5 × 10 -3 ssy with differences observed between genotypes (Brayne, Dearlove, Lester, Kosakovsky Pond, & Frost, 2017) .
Here, we compare the genotype groupings of all three viral species utilizing several thousand genome sequences downloaded from public databases. The phylogenetic analysis was restricted to human isolates, except for HEV for which pig/wild boar and rabbit isolates were included. Their codon usage and amino acid frequencies were compared, and viral genomes of other species were then included to provide insights toward the possible evolutionary origin of HAV.
In March 2019, over 5,000 viral genomes of HAV, HCV, and HEV were downloaded from Genbank to assess their inter-and intraspecies relationships. The size of downloaded sequences was restricted to 7,000-7,900 bp for HAV, 9,000-9,990 bp for HCV, and 7,000-7,800 bp for HEV. Animal isolates were excluded, except for swine/ wild boar/rabbit HEV isolates. Sequences with ambiguous nucleotide stretches >2 were removed. Finally, redundancy was removed.
A provisional phylogenetic tree was constructed (see below), and exceptionally long branches were checked in detail; these were without exception isolates of animal origin, which were subsequently removed. The final datasets contained 134 HAV genomes, 2,542 HCV genomes, and 557 HEV genomes.
The genomes were aligned by MAFFT (Yamada, Tomii, & Katoh, 2016) , and FastTree was used to build phylogenetic maximum-likelihood (ML) trees (Price, Dehal, & Arkin, 2009 ). This infers approximately maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees and is much faster than other algorithms; we used the generalized time-reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide evolution and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test for statistical confidence of internal nodes. Information on genotypes and subtypes that were included in GenBank annotations was used to map these on the trees. For visual representation, the HCV and HEV trees are shown after collapsing branches at 90% identity.
Codon usage tables were also calculated for representative genomes for each genotype per species, as there were only minor differences between genotypes within a species, using the Codon Usage Calculator (https ://www.biolo gicsc orp.com/tools/ Codon Usage Calcu lator ) and averaged results were plotted in net plots with Excel. The codons of overlapping coding regions in HepE were first removed for this analysis, and their effect was assessed by a separate analysis where they were added in both frames, which did (Xia, 2013) .
The three viral species HAV, HCV, and HEV are not phylogenetically related. Separate phylogenetic trees were produced for the three viral species, with 134 HAV genomes, 2,542 HCV genomes, and 557 HEV genomes, as shown in Figure 1 . All trees were drawn to scale, to illustrate the much lower genomic diversity of HAV compared with the other two species. The trees for HCV and HEV were collapsed at 90% identity for graphical representation. The HAV branches remained un-collapsed, since the shown branches per genotype all have a similarity >90%. The genomic diversity of HEV is higher than that of HAV but lower than that of HCV, as illustrated by the branch lengths of the trees. The produced HAV tree is in good agreement with previously published data (Vaughan et al., 2014) , although we did not include simian serotypes IV to VI. Our HCV tree that was based on 2,542 genomes is also mostly in agreement with previous publications that used smaller datasets. A neighbor joining (NJ) tree based on 162 genome sequences (Jackowiak et al., 2014) already identified a relationship between genotype 1 (Gt1) and Gt4, which is also visible in Figure 1 ; these two genotypes have evolved later than the other genotypes (Preciado et al., 2014) . The relationship between Gt2 and Gt7 was also noted before. However, our data produced a better resolution of genotypes than the NJ tree published by Jackowiak and colleagues. An ML tree based on 129 genome sequences (Smith et al., 2014) also did not fully resolve the branch of Gt1 and Gt4 with respect to the other genotypes. It is unclear on what data the tree shown in a review article (Preciado et al., 2014) was based, in which Gt1 and Gt4 were separated. In our tree, the branch leading to Gt1 and Gt4 is placed between Gt3 and Gt6/Gt8. Upon closer investigation of HCV genomes for which a subtype was specified in their Genbank annotation, only a few annotations did not match the current nomenclature, all of which were given a genotype before standardization of the nomenclature (Tokita et al., 1996) . This illustrates that historical Genbank annotations must be interpreted with caution. The six genotypes of HEV are also well resolved in Figure 1 , but the subtypes within these genotypes are not.
Notably, one collapsed branch contained members of subtypes 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1f, whose close distances have been noted before (Smith et al., 2016) . On the other hand, the genetic diversity within Gt3 is extensive, even if rabbit isolates are ignored ( Figure 1 ). Based on their overall genomic similarity, members of Gt3 could be considered to belong to multiple genotypes that could be newly defined.
This was observed by Smith and colleagues as well, but they decided to keep the nomenclature of genotypes 1-4 as proposed by Lu, Li, and Hagedorn (2006) , since this was already well established. As a result, there is no consistent degree of similarity within the different genotypes and their subtypes for HEV, in contrast to the more transparent nomenclature of HCV.
The codon usage of the three viral species was next analyzed.
Typically, codon usage is expressed as relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), which calculates the over-or underabundance of specific codons relative to their expected frequencies based on TA B L E 1 Virus species included for comparison of codon usage and amino acid frequencies the nucleotide composition of an open reading frame (ORF). For instance, codon use of HEV was analyzed by RCSU (Hu et al., 2011) .
Appendix Figure A1 compares the RSCU values of the three viral species, plotted in a wheel plot. This identified differences in codon usage between HAV on the one hand and HCV/HEV on the other hand. The codon usage of HAV is suboptimal for replication in the human host, while the codon usage of HCV is highly adapted to that of human cells, as has been described before (Pintó, Aragonès, Costafreda, Ribes, & Bosch, 2007) . RCSU values are an excellent means to compare codon usage of individual genes within a given (prokaryotic) genome, as cells typically control gene expression by minor codon preferences (Sharp & Li, 1986) . However, when comparing virus proteomes with large differences in codon usage, we consider it useful to look at this usage without correcting for nucleotide composition differences, as a dependence exists between nucleotide composition and codon usage preferences. Thus, we calculated codon usage as the fraction of used codons per given amino acid.
Without a correction for nucleotide composition, the differences between HAV and HCV/HEV is amplified, and now the values can be compared with the overall codon usage of human cells ( Figure 2 ).
As can be seen, two trends describe the deoptimized codon use of HAV: (a) the virus strongly prefers codons with T over C at the third (wobble) position, while for human cells it is the other way round;
this is clearly visible for Cys, Asp, Phe, Asn, and Tyr ( Figure 2c ). These are all amino acids for which only two codons are available, but the same third-base preference for T can also be seen for Ala and Pro;
(b) A weaker preference for codons having A at the third position is visible for Lys, Gly, and Arg. The deoptimized codon usage is still evident when only those amino acids are considered that occur at a high frequency (>4.5%) in the polypeptide of HAV (Figure 2d ). That HAV strongly prefers T at the third position may be partly responsible for its high T-content (32.8% on average, Table 1 ), but this is not a general rule. For instance, rabies virus (a negative strand ssRNA virus) prefers codons ending in G while its genome contains only 22.7% G (Zhang et al., 2018) . 
Nevertheless, nonpreferred third bases can slow down the translation machinery, which presumably allows better protein folding of the capsid protein (Pintó et al., 2018) . Costafreda and coworkers have shown that selection for deoptimized HAV codons was related to transcription efficiency, antigenicity of capsid protein, plaque size, and survival rates of virions (Costafreda et al., 2014) . However, it is hard to envisage how this situation might have evolved when an ancestor of HAV had a codon usage that was better adapted to the mammalian host. In general, the direction of virus evolution would be toward more efficient, not toward less efficient translation and replication in a given host, as it would result in more (or more rapid) virion production. Moreover, if the selective pressure would mostly apply to optimal folding of the capsid protein, only that coding region of the genome would depend on using deoptimized codons, but the virus proteome is consistently using codons that human cells do not prefer, over its complete ORF length This is shown in Appendix Figure A2 . We consider the most likely explanation for the current codon usage of HAV that it is a remnant of an ancestor virus that replicated in a host with a codon usage preference different to that of humans.
The most likely direct ancestor of HAV was a virus replicating in rodents, although simian HAV is more closely related to human HAV than rodent hepatoviruses are (Dexler et al., 2015) . The codon usage in simian HAV (genotype V) strongly resembles that of human HAV, as do rodent hepatoviral species (Appendix Figure A3 panel a) .
Since Dexler and colleagues had proposed that rodent HAV species F I G U R E 2 Codon usage wheel plots of HCV, HEV, and HAV, compared with human codon usage. The viral codon usage shown is a calculated average of (a) 6 HCV genomes representing genotypes 1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a', (b) 9 HEV genomes of genotypes 1-4 of human, swine and rabit origines, and (c) 6 HAV genomes of genotypes IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA and IIIB. Panel (d) shows the HAV codon usage for those amino acids used at frequencies >45% only. The codons are sorted for amino acids, with, from top clockwise, amino acids with 2, 3, 4, and 6 codons. Nonvariable amino acids are excluded (Table 1) . The latter (African sheath-tailed bat) is widespread in Africa and prefers a diet of beetles and lepidopterans (McWilliam, 1987) . Both investigated bat hepatovirus species had a codon usage extremely similar to that of the other analyzed hepatovirus species ( Figure A3 panel a) . Thus, possibly the selection mechanism proposed for HAV that resulted in de-optimized codon use for its human host also applies to these other hepatoviruses that replicate in other mammalian hosts.
Alternatively, a possible ancestor with a codon usage that was adapted to an alternative host must be sought in a more distant evolutionary history. If such an ancestor virus once existed, it more likely replicated in a host with a GC content much lower than that of mammals, as the overall codon usage of mammalian cells does not vary much between species. Instead, codon usage in mammals is primarily governed by within-genome variation in GC content, and only weakly, if at all, correlates to gene expression and tRNA content (Galtier et al., 2018) .
We and Prevotella oralis, a Gram-negative member of the class Bacteroidia.
In Appendix Figure A4 , it is shown that the best match in codon use between HAV and these bacterial species was found for E. faecalis.
Bacteriophages with an ssRNA (+) genome have been described, for instance bacteriophage MS2, which infects Escherichia coli and other members of Enterobacteriaceae. It is an icosahedral virus, just like HAV is. Another example is phage AP205 that propagates in Acinetobacter species (Klovins, Overbeek, Worm, Ackermann, & Duin, 2002) . Single-strand RNA bacteriophages are typically members of the Leviviridae family (Olsthoorn & van Duin, 2011) that bear no sequence resemblance to HAV. So far, a bacteriophage with structural or sequence similarity to HAV has not been described, but it should be noted that RNA phages have not been extensively studied or described, and this type of bacteriophages suffers from underreporting (Callanan et al., 2018) .
Another possibility of an ancestral virus for HAV was assessed based on the reported structural similarity between HAV and insect viruses that are members of Dicistroviridae (also Picornavirales; Wang et al., 2015) . In particular, Wang and colleagues observed structural similarity between HAV and triatoma virus that replicates in triatomines (kissing bugs, Czibener, Torre, Muscio, Ugalde, & Scodeller, 2000) and with cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) that propagates in cricket species endemic to Australia (Wilson, Powell, Hoover, & Sarnow, 2000) . When we compared codon usage of HAV to that of these two viral species, a striking similarity was observed.
In particular, the codon use of triatoma virus is highly similar to that of HAV ( Figure 3 ) and that similarity is higher than that of HAV to CrPV or to the tested potential bacterial hosts. Figure 3c further demonstrates that the codon usage of triatoma virus is well adapted to its natural insect host, Triatoma infestans.
We next tested if the similarity in codon usage is restricted to HAV, its direct cousins, possible ancestors, and the two insect virus species. That was not the case, as another Dicistroviridae member, Israel acute paralysis virus, showed the same pattern. Even an insect virus not belonging to Dicistroviridae, varroa destructor virus (Iflaviridae, replicating in the varroa mite that is parasitic to bees) produced a very similar codon usage plot (Figure 3d ). We then extended the comparison to other ss(+)RNA virus families and identified an equally strong similarity to human coronavirus, a Nidovirales member. Coronaviruses are not known to replicate in insects, but it has been proposed that they might have an insect virus as their ancestor (Nga et al., 2011; Zirkel et al., 2011) .
This is not to say that HCV and HEV are exceptional with respect to their codon usage. Other Picornaviridae members such as human cosavirus or rhinovirus have codon preferences that more resemble HCV and HEV than HAV (Appendix Figure A3 panel b), although between these species slightly more variation is observed for single codons than we observe for HAV and the virus species shown in Figure 3d . These two Picornaviridae illustrate that the observed distinction in codon usage does not follow taxonomic divisions, as they do not group with HAV and other Picornavirales. Norovirus 
HPgV WNV (a Caliciviridae member) also matches the HCV/HEV codon usage pattern. Human pegivirus (HPgV), which is also known by the alternative names hepatitis G virus or GB virus C, is also included in this comparison. The virus rarely infects hepatocytes and its role in human disease is still being discussed (Marano et al., 2017) . Its codon usage also resembles that of HCV and HEV, although it is a member of the Flavivridae (Table 1) . Zika virus and West Nile virus (also Flaviviridae) are transmitted by mosquitoes; however, they do not have an insect-like signature as their codon usage is also similar to that of HCV and HEV ( Figure A3 ).
The effective number of codons (ENC) was also calculated, using the method by Xia (Xia, 2013) which is an improved version of the original method by Wright (Wright, 1990) . Table A1 ; HAV had a score of 46.9, HEV scored 51.9, and HCV scored 54.0. The insect virus species varied from 45.0 (triatoma virus) to 52.6 (cricket paralysis virus). The highest score was reported for norovirus (58.3) and
the lowest for rodent hepatovirus (43.1). These results support the view that a codon bias exists for HAV, but it seems an even stronger bias exists for rodent hepatovirus and for triatomavirus, although codon usage of the latter is well adapted to its host.
Since codon preference is related to nucleotide composition, this parameter was next compared for all coding regions of the virus species included in the comparison. Nucleotide composition is normally expressed as %GC, but for single-strand genomes, the contribution of individual bases was also assessed (Figure 4 ). Either analysis clearly divided the various virus species into two groups, with HAV, the insect viruses and coronavirus, rhinovirus, and cosavirus being more AT rich and relatively low in C (panel 4A), while Zikavirus, WNV, norovirus, and
HPgV grouped with HCV and HEV and were all rich in G and C (panel 4B). Simian, rodent, and bat hepatovirus were very similar to HAV.
These were not included in panel 4A for clarity, but their similarity in base composition can be seen in Table 1 . In terms of %GC versus %AT, rhinovirus and cosavirus were closer to HAV than they were to HCV/ HEV (panel 4C) although in terms of their codon usage preference, they clearly did not belong to the HAV group. This shows that the codon usage findings only partly correlate with nucleotide composition. is clearly visible, as is the avoidance of C at that same position. That HAV also has a notable preference for C at the second position had not been apparent from the wheel plot of Figure 2 . In none of these analyses did HAV behave differently from some or all of the other analyzed genomes.
Finally, because of lack of sequence similarity between the various virus species, the amino acid composition of their proteomes was compared, as this is even less dependent of nucleotide composition than codon usage preference is. Again, this comparison segregated the analyzed virus proteomes into two groups, one containing virus species with an amino acid frequency more HAV-like and the other group more resembling HCV and HEV ( Figure 6 ) In all analyses presented here, HCV and HEV group together, although these virus species do not share sequence similarity and are not classified in the same taxonomic families (Table 1) . A structural similarity between HEV and Caliciviridae (to which norovirus belongs) has been noted before (Bradley, 1990) , but it is apparent that HCV also bears resemblance to Flaviviridae, as not only exemplified by HCV but also by the other Flaviviridae included here (HPgV, Zika virus and WNV).
A full explanation for the observations regarding HAV cannot be given, but it opens the intriguing possibility that HAV, its close relatives simian, rodent, and bat hepatovirus, and the insect virus species analyzed here are somehow related, and might even have shared a common ancestor. That ancestor might have been an insect virus that underwent a host jump to bats, after it was passed on to rodents and eventually simians and humans. The jump from insect to bat may have occurred in the blood (in case a blood-sucking insect was the source) or in the gut of insectivorous bats. A candidate for this putative common ancestor has not been identified, as no invertebrate virus is yet described with sequence similarity to HAV, but its existence can be hypothesized. In contrast, HEV and HCV seem to have a common ancestor not related to that of HAV and form a different group of (human) ssRNA ( 
Although no sequence similarity is detected between the various virus species compared here, in combination the presented data make it plausible that an ancestor virus of HAV and other hepatoviral species was an insect virus, with a codon use adapted to that host, whose signature is still visible in current HAV genome. We consider it possible that a blood-sucking insect such as triatomes, which feeds on mammals, may have been the source for a virus crossing host species. Alternatively, a host jump may have taken place in the gut of insectivorous bats. More speculative is the possibility that in a long evolutionary past all these virus species may have originated from bacteriophages that propagated in Gram-negative AT-rich bacteria, with which they still share codon preference and amino acid frequency.

41,d1a63ffc7f247f2e825680e974760a8f73676d3c,"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25-kDa protein of the lipocalin superfamily and its presence was initially observed in activated neutrophils. It has previously been demonstrated that the expression of NGAL is markedly increased in stimulated epithelia, and is important in the innate immunological response to various pathophysiological conditions, including infection, cancer, inflammation and kidney injury. The present study constructed a ventilator-associated lung injury model in mice. NGAL mRNA and protein expression levels in lung tissue were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. In addition, NGAL protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum were measured via western blotting. The results of the present study suggested that NGAL expression increased under all mechanical ventilation treatments. The increase was most prominent in the high peak inflation pressure and high-volume mechanical ventilation groups, where there was the greatest extent of lung injury. In addition, NGAL expression increased in a time-dependent manner under high-volume mechanical ventilation, consistent with the degree of lung injury. These findings suggested that NGAL may serve as a potential novel biomarker in ventilator-associated lung injury.","Mechanical ventilation may induce and exacerbate lung injury, in contrast to its lifesaving effects. It has previously been demonstrated that biotrauma is an underlying mechanism of lung injury, important factors of which include inflammation and the innate immune response (1) . Biological markers of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) are important for early diagnosis and prognosis, and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of VALI. Currently identified biomarkers of VALI are key elements of the inflammatory and immune response pathways; however, the precise function of each mediator remains to be elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have validated the sensitivity or specificity of any biological markers that may aid early diagnosis or treatment of VALI (2, 3) . Further studies are required in order to identify novel, sensitive and specific biological markers.
Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMNs) have been demonstrated to be important in the development and progression of VALI and may lie at the center of a positive feedback loop that results in lung injury (4) . Therefore, PMNs or key mediators of the PMN regulatory signaling pathway may be molecular candidates for the occurrence of VALI (5) . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a 25-kDa protein of the lipocalin family, was originally isolated from specific neutrophil granules (6, 7) . In addition to excretion by activated neutrophils, NGAL may be released in small quantities by epithelial and kidney tubular cells, and during inflammation or injury. Elevated NGAL is an early blood-based marker of acute kidney injury and is detectable within 2-12 h following an ischemic/toxic insult in patients with cardiovascular diseases (8, 9) .
The function of NGAL in the regulation of alveolar epithelial cells and in VALI remains to be elucidated. The expression level of NGAL, which is extensively involved in inflammation and the immune response, is an indicator of PMN activation. As an acute and secretory phase protein, NGAL is easily detected in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (10, 11) . The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the use of NGAL as a novel diagnostic marker for VALI. The results indicated that NGAL levels increase in lung tissue, BAL fluid and serum during VALI in mice. Therefore, NGAL may represent a novel diagnostic marker for the early prediction of patients at high risk of VALI.
Animals and experimental protocol. Male C57BL/6 mice, (20±2 g, 6-8 weeks and free of murine specific pathogens), were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Guangdong Province (Guangzhou, China). The mice were housed in a specific pathogen free animal house at a temperature of 22±2˚C Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a potential novel biomarker for ventilator-associated lung injury and a relative humidity of 55±5% with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. Throughout the experimental process, the mice were housed in a laminar flow cabinet and maintained on standard laboratory food ad libitum. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Experiments were conducted on 42 wild-type mice, which were divided into 7 groups. The protocol for the control group was spontaneous breathing for 2 h. The protocol for the high peak inflation pressure (high-PIP) group was breathing under the condition of 50 cm H 2 O of PIP and 2. Table I .
Collection of BAL fluid, serum or lung tissue. Following treatment, animals were sacrificed via administration of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Peripheral blood was extracted by removing the eyeball. Following overnight storage at 4˚C, serum was collected via centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 30 min at 4˚C. Immediately post-mortem, the heart-lung block was dissected and BAL fluid was obtained using the method previously described (12, 13) . BAL fluid was centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C and the supernatant was collected for western blotting. For reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting of lung samples, the right lung was cut into samples (~1x1 cm) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunohistochemical and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, the left lung was fixed as previously described (14) . The vertical axis of each left lung was identified and the lung was cut perpendicular to this axis into 4-mm thick slices.
RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from frozen lung samples using TRIzol reagent (Ambion; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was quantified by measuring absorption at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm using the NanoDrop system (NanoDrop; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). and stored at -70˚C until required. A total of 1 µg total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the AffinityScript QPCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), and RT-qPCR was performed using the Brilliant II SYBR-Green QPCR Master Mix kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) under the conditions as follows: preheating at 95˚C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95˚C for 10 sec, 60˚C for 20 sec and 72˚C for 10 sec. The primers were purchased from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and the sequences were as follows: Forward, 5'-CCC TGA ACT GAA GGA ACG-3' and reverse, 5'-TTG GTA TGG TGG CTG GTG-3' for NGAL, and forward, 5'-CAT CCG TAA AGA CCT CTA TGC CAA C-3' and reverse, 5'-ATG GAG CCA CCG ATC CAC A-3' for β-actin. PCR reactions were performed on an iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Gene expression was measured in triplicate, quantified using the 2 −ΔΔCq method (15) and normalized to the β-actin internal control.
Western blotting. Lung tissue protein was extracted using ice-cold RIPA buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Protein concentration was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Total proteins (30 µg) were separated by 8-12% SDS-PAGE at 120 V, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 250 mA for 90 min via wet transfer. Following blocking non-specific binding sites with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with Tween-20 (20 mM/l TBS pH 7.5, 500 mM/l NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h, the blots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (sc-47778; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) and anti-NGAL (MAB1857; 1:1,000; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) primary antibodies at 37˚C for 1 h. Bands were detected using an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (7076; 1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) at 37˚C for 40 min followed by treatment with SuperSignal ® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and X-ray film exposure (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). The film was scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed using QuantityOne software version 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Squares of equal size were drawn around each band to measure the density, and the value was adjusted based on the density of the background near that band. Densitometric analysis was repeated three times. Results were expressed as a ratio of the target protein compared with the reference protein. The ratio of the target protein from the control group was arbitrarily set to 1.
H&E staining. Lung samples were fixed in 10% formalin solution at 4˚C for 24 h, and dehydrated. The samples were wax embedded and cut into 4-6 µm sections on a microtome. The sections were flattened, mounted and heated on blank glass slides. Histological evaluations were performed by H&E staining and pathological examination using a CTR 6500 microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).
Immunohistochemical staining of NGAL. Following deparaffinization and dehydration, the sections were immersed in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) with 0.05% Tween-20, for 5 min at 58˚C, and subsequently treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Following blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) at room temperature for 20 min, the slides were incubated at 4˚C with a rat monoclonal anti-NGAL antibody (MAB1857; 1:100; R&D Systems, Inc.) overnight. Finally, slides were incubated with a rabbit anti-rat biotin-conjugated IgG H&L secondary antibody (ab6733; 1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at room temperature for 1 h, and detected using an avidin-biotin complex system (Vectastain ABC-kit; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 19.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Scheffe's test. Statistical differences between two groups were determined using the unpaired Student's t-test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Different modalities of mechanical ventilation affect the extent of lung injury. Following the application of different modalities of mechanical ventilation, lung tissue was collected and evaluated via H&E staining, as presented in Fig. 1A . The control, LV2, LV4 and low-PIP groups exhibited a normal histology. HV2, HV4 and high-PIP groups presented an abnormal histology compared with the control group. These abnormalities included alveolar septal thickening indicative of edema formation, mononuclear cell infiltration of the alveolar walls, hemorrhage, fibrin exudation and intra-alveolar erythrocyte infiltration.
To validate the VALI model in mice, total protein from BAL fluid was detected. As presented in Fig. 1B , total protein concentration in BAL fluid of LV2, LV4 and low-PIP groups did not differ from the control group. Total protein concentration in BAL fluid of HV2, HV4 and high-PIP groups was greater compared with the control group. Therefore, these observations suggested that LV2, LV4 and low-PIP modalities of mechanical ventilation are safe, whereas HV2, HV4 and high-PIP may result in lung injury.
To investigate NGAL expression in a mouse model of VALI, lung tissues, BAL fluid and serum were collected from control, LV2, HV2 low-PIP and high-PIP groups. RT-qPCR demonstrated that NGAL mRNA expression in lung tissue was increased in all groups compared with the control group, particularly the HV2 and high-PIP groups ( Fig. 2A) . As presented in Fig. 2B and C, NGAL protein expression levels were increased in all groups compared with the control group, particularly in the HV2 and high-PIP groups.
To investigate the expression of NGAL in a mouse model of VALI, mice were subjected to low-or high-volume mechanical ventilation for 2 h or 4 h. As presented in Fig. 3A , NGAL mRNA expression levels in lung tissue demonstrated no difference between LV2 and LV4 exposure. However, a significant increase was present in HV4 compared with the HV2 group. Similarly, NGAL protein expression levels in lung tissue did not differ between the LV2 and LV4 groups; however, they were markedly greater in the HV4 group compared with the HV2 group ( Fig. 3B and C) . Protein expression profiles of NGAL in BAL fluid and serum were similar to those in lung tissue ( Fig. 3B and C) .
To evaluate the spatial localization of NGAL expression, immunohistochemical staining of murine lung tissue samples from injured and control mice was performed. As presented in Fig. 4 , strong murine NGAL expression was detected in the lung tissue from injured mice. In addition, NGAL expression was increased in lung vascular endothelial cells and infiltrating neutrophils of the injured lung.
VALI has recently been of primary concern for clinicians and researchers. The reduction in mortality associated with low tidal volume ventilation in patients with acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome has resulted in an increased research interest toward the underlying mechanism of VALI (16) . The roles of the innate immune response and inflammation in the pathogenesis of VALI have been extensively studied in recent years. It has previously been suggested High-PIP, high peak inflation pressure; Low-PIP, low peak inflation pressure; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure; HV, high-volume; LV, low-volume. that inflammation may not be integral to the initiation of VALI; however, prevalent data in the field suggests a major pathogenetic role of inflammation and lung neutrophil recruitment. Therefore, investigators have searched for biological markers of VALI and therapeutic targets that may facilitate treatment. NGAL of the lipocalin superfamily, was originally isolated from specific neutrophil granules (6, 7) . NGAL protein levels are typically very low in various biological fluids (17) . Previous studies have demonstrated that NGAL expression is associated with acute injury, particularly acute kidney injury. However, an association between NGAL and acute lung injury has not yet been reported. The present study characterized the expression profile of NGAL in mice subjected to different mechanical ventilation protocols. NGAL mRNA and protein expression levels in lung tissue increased under all mechanical ventilation treatments; however, a significant increase was observed following high-volume or high-PIP mechanical ventilation. A similar NGAL increase was further detected in BAL fluid and serum, and was notably increased following high-volume or high-PIP mechanical ventilation. NGAL expression was time-dependent under high-volume mechanical ventilation treatment. Immunohistochemical localization studies revealed increased NGAL expression in lung endothelium, alveolar epithelial cells, and infiltrating neutrophils. NGAL is easily detected in serum and BAL fluid (10, 11) . The results of the present study verify the role of NGAL as a novel and potential biomarker for VALI. A previous study revealed that plasma concentrations of NGAL were increased in oleic acid-induced acute lung injury and a conventional mechanical ventilation model in piglets (18) . Serum NGAL levels were additionally significantly increased in lung transplant patients (19) .
In conclusion, the present study used an animal model to identify NGAL as a potential novel biomarker for mechanical-induced lung injury. Further studies are required to define the functional role of NGAL and the pathophysiology of altered NGAL expression in VALI.",Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a potential novel biomarker for ventilator-associated lung injury,"Xiao, Rui; Chen, Rongchang",Mol Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436233/,181,2241,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-Kre2p/Mntlp antibodies identify a 60-kD integral membrane protein that is progressively N-glycosylated in an MNNl-dependent manner. Kre2p/Mntlp is localized in a Golgi compartment that overlaps with that containing the medial-Golgi mannosyltransferase Mnnlp, and distinct from that including the late Golgi protein Kexlp. To determine which regions of Kre2p/Mntlp are required for Golgi localization, Kre2p/Mntlp mutant proteins were assem-bled by substitution of Kre2p domains with equivalent sequences from the vacuolar proteins DPAP B and Pho8p. Chimeric proteins were tested for correct topology, in vitro and in vivo activity, and were localized intracellularly by indirect immunofluorescence. The resuits demonstrate that the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain is necessary for correct Kre2p Golgi localization whereas, the membrane-spanning and stem domains are dispensable. However, in a test of targeting sufficiency, the presence of the entire Kre2p cytoplasmic tail, plus the transmembrane domain and a 36-amino acid residue luminal stem region was required to localize a Pho8p reporter protein to the yeast Golgi. T HE Golgi apparatus plays a fundamental role in glycan processing and sorting of newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. The Golgi apparatus of a typical mammalian cell is composed of a polarized stack of membranous saccules that are differentiated into functionally distinct subcompartments. After the addition of core N-linked sugar moieties in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycoproteins proceed through the cis-Golgi network, the cis-, medial-, and transcisternae, and the trans-Golgi network, where further modifications take place. These include the addition of O-linked sugars and the elaboration, in a protein-specific manner, of complex N-linked carbohydrate structures. The Golgi apparatus also constitutes a major organelle responsible for protein trafficking where particular proteins are directed to precise cellular locations. Two specific Golgi subcompartments have been found to be involved in protein sorting. The cis-Golgi network constitutes the site from which many resident ER proteins are retrieved, and the main function of the TGN is to direct glycoproteins exiting the Golgi complex to either the lysosome or the cell surface (",,"Localization and targeting of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kre2p/Mnt1p alpha 1,2-mannosyltransferase to a medial-Golgi compartment",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2200012/,356,9247,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,06c4f9daabdf5ee16fb4b581a954e3909d9f17a0,"Leishmania is associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from simple cutaneous to invasive visceral leishmaniasis. Here, the sequences of ten cysteine proteases of types A, B and C of Leishmania major were obtained from GeneDB database. Prediction of MHC class I epitopes of these cysteine proteases was performed by NetCTL program version 1.2. In addition, by using BcePred server, dif ferent structural properties of the proteins were predicted to f ind out their potential B cell epitopes. According to this computational analysis, nine regions were predicted as B cell epitopes. The results provide useful information for designing peptide-based vaccines.","Leishmania (Order: Kinetoplastida, Family: Trypanasomatidae) is an obligate intracellular parasite responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from simple cutaneous to invasive visceral leishmaniasis (1 ) . Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania present two forms in their life cycle: promastigote, which multiplies in the mid gut of the sand fly vector, and amastigote, the obligate intracellular form that lives within phagolysosomes of the vertebrate host (2 , 3 ) . Three major types of leishmaniasis, namely cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral, occur in humans depending on the species of Leishmania. Infection by species such as L. major, L. tropica and L. mexicana may cause localized cutaneous lesions, resulting in lifelong immunity. Infection by L. braziliensis and L. panamensis initially presents as cutaneous lesions that may then spread or metastasize causing mucocutaneous lesions. Infection by L. donovani, L. infantum and L. chagasi may result in a chronic disseminating visceral disease in the liver and spleen (4 ) .
It has been recognized for many years that proteases of pathogenic organisms may modulate the host's defense mechanisms (5 ) . Proteases are grouped into clans and families on the basis of the architecture of their catalytic dyad or triad (6 ) . Each clan is identified with two letters, the first representing the catalytic type of the families included in the clan. L. major has cysteine proteases (CPs) of eight families within clan CA. Family C1 contains CPA and CPB, which are both cathepsin L-like in terms of primary amino acid sequence, and CPC, which is cathepsin Blike. CPB is unusual in that it has a 100-amino acid C-terminal extension in comparison with most CPs of the group, and exists as multiple isoenzymes, which are encoded by a tandem array of similar CPB genes located in a single locus (the arrays comprise eight genes in L. major ). The CPBs of L. mexicana are stage-regulated and the isoforms present differences in their substrate specificity and catalytic properties (7 ) .
Although the exact roles of CPs in Leishmania pathogenesis are unclear, it has been demonstrated that Leishmania cannot grow within macrophages in the presence of CP inhibitors (8 ) . These observations provide evidence of the importance of these molecules in the survival of both promastigote and amastigote forms of these parasites (9 ) . Despite trypanosomatid CPs may be instrumental in modulating the host's immune response to favor parasite survival and proliferation, they are themselves immunogenic. L. mexicana CP is a T cell immunogen, resulting in the development of potentially protective Thl cell lines (10 ) . This finding suggests that the CP itself is a vaccine candidate and that homologous enzymes in other species may also be so. A CP of L. pifanoi, however, provided rather little protection for the host against infection with the parasite (11 ), although more recently a similar L. amazonensis CP provided some protection against subsequent challenge, apparently through inducing a Thl-associated response (12 ) . These differing results presumably reflect the complexity of the immune response to the active parasite enzymes and how the response may be determined by the precise immunization conditions. It is therefore encouraging that a CP-rich fraction of L. major was shown to be a strong inducer of a primed human immune response and may have protective function (13 ) . These observations suggest that trypanosomatid CPs have potential as vaccines although attempts to exploit them are really just beginning (14 , 15 ) . In addition, it has also been proven that infected dendritic cells are the critical antigenpresenting cells responsible for T cell priming in Leishmania infections. Amastigotes, but not the infectious promastigotes, are the main targets for phagocytosis activity of dendritic cells (16 , 17 ) .
A key step in the design of subunit vaccines is the identification of epitopes from overlapping synthetic peptides. This method decreases the possibility of missed epitopes, but lots of peptides need to be synthesized at a high cost. New developments in immunoinformatics and other computational methodologies, combined with the broad versatility in the design and synthesis of genetic (DNA) vaccines, underlay new strategies for the novel design of antigen-specific, epitope-based vaccines against many pathogens that currently have proven refractive to conventional vaccine therapy (18 ) . Epitopes are selected by prediction with software, which saves the expense of synthetic peptides and working time (19 , 20 ) .
Basically, the recognition of antigenic epitopes by the immune system, either small discrete T cell epitopes or large conformational epitopes recognized by B cells and soluble antibodies, is the key molecular event at the heart of the immune response to pathogens (21 ) . The objective of this bioinformaticsbased study is to enhance the optimal selection of epitopic regions of clan CA, C1 family of cysteine proteases as potential targets of immune response. Consensus sequence methodology was used to identify sequences of 9 amino acids or longer with complete conservation in 80% or more of C1 families of cysteine proteases. These conserved sequences were further analyzed to identify targets for candidate epitopebased T cell vaccine formulations against L. major. Furthermore, concerning the activation of human humoral immunity by leishmaniasis, B cell epitopes were also predicted based on propensity scales for each of the 20 amino acids. Utilizing bioinformatics servers for vaccine candidates is a time-saving approach that could significantly help to increase our information about various aspects of pathogens in molecular biology. These theoretical predictions can then be tested by using experimental and complementary methods.
For the prediction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I binding peptides of C1 family of cysteine proteases, one sequence for each of the cysteine proteases A, B and C was selected. In the case of CPB, due to the high similarity between these cysteine proteases, only one out of eight sequences was chosen (LmjF08.1050). This sequence is a good candidate of CPB because of the complete identity of its sequence with the consensus sequence of CPB. All overlapping nonamer peptides were generated from this dataset and were screened for potential T cell antigens using the NetCTL algorithm, from which 716 peptides were short-listed. Most of the peptides were found to exhibit mono-supertype specificity, meaning that they bind to a single supertype. Some of them, however, appeared to bind to multiple supertypes; the highest number of supertypes a given nonamer could bind is 5 out of the 12 supertypes tested. In fact, out of the 716 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-binding nonamers, one peptide binds to 5 supertypes, 4 bind to 4 supertypes, 9 bind to 3 supertypes and 44 bind to 2 supertypes. Sequences of binding peptides to the 4 and 5 supertypes and the name of proteins they belong to are summarized in Table 1 .
Knowing the number of binding peptides of each of the analyzed proteins is important, considering the polymorphic nature of HLA and its diversity in populations of different geographical regions. Therefore, a good T cell antigen should have peptides recognized by many HLA alleles. The analysis revealed that CPB has the maximum number of binding peptides, followed by CPC and CPA, respectively ( Table 2) . For short-listing potential vaccine candidates, it is important to analyze the binding profiles from a supertype perspective. Of the 12 supertypes studied, the largest number of nonamers was found to be recognized by the allele B62 (53), followed by B58 (38) , A2 (36), A24 (24), A1, B8 and B39 (21), B44 (20), A3 and B7 (19) , B27 (17) and A26 (15) , as illustrated in Figure 1 .
The score with which a peptide binds to HLA ranges from 0.75 to 3.1949 . In general, the binding score of CPC peptides to A1 locus supertypes is higher compared with CPB, CPA and other supertypes ( Table 3) .
Putative promiscuous T cell epitopes may be localized in clusters, as reported in studies of HIV-1 (22) (23) (24) (25) , the outer membrane of Chlamydia trachomatis (26 ), and among others (27 , 28 ) . The clusters are also ideal for developing epitope-based vaccines because they contain multiple promiscuous epitopes. The number of immunogenic hotspots for CPA, CPB and CPC is 4, 5 and 0, respectively, as shown in Table 4 .
The identification of conserved sequences is very important to design peptide vaccines, because vaccines that are developed on the basis of the conserved segments among candidate proteins can be used against a large majority of pathogen's variants. In Figure 2 , three segments (I, II and III) with identity ≥90% and have ≥9 amino acids in length are shown as conserved regions. Obviously the epitopes predicted in these regions are very significant. For immunological applications, a minimum conserved sequence length of 9 amino acids is required because this represents the typical length of peptides that bind to HLA molecules (29 ) . The features of potential epitopes located in conserved regions with maximum scores are summarized in Table 5 .
Before the prediction of B cell epitope of CPB (LmjF08.1050), signal peptide of this protein predicted by SignalP 3.0 hidden Markov model (HMM) (signal peptide probability 0.999, signal anchor probability 0.001, with cleavage site probability 0.760 between residues 27 and 28) was excluded. Hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, turns, exposed surface, polarity and antigenic propensity scales were applied to predict B cell epitopes. These parameters were correlated with the location of continuous epitopes. As a result, 9 regions were predicted to be B cell epitopes (Figure 2 ).
The aim of this investigation was to apply bioinformatics methods to study the B and T cell epitopic sites of C1 family cysteine proteases of L. major. To help the development of vaccines, understanding the structural basis for the cell-mediated immune response is necessary (30 ) . The perfect bioinformatics prediction of T cell epitopes can to a great extent reduce the experimental cost in candidate epitope identification (31 ) .
In the present study, NetCTL program has been used to predict MHC class I of cysteine proteases A, B and C of L. major (32 ) . CP proteins are immunogenic and are potential vaccine candidates. Efficient processing and presentation of vaccine antigens by class I and/or class II MHC are essential for a good T cell response. Since humans carry only a limited number of co-dominant HLA alleles in their genome (2 each for A, B and C loci), out of hundreds of polymorphic alleles present in the population, it becomes important that a candidate vaccine must generate peptides that bind to a wide range of HLA molecules to provide good population coverage. In this work we found that generated peptides bind in larger numbers to B supertypes. However, almost all of the peptides with the highest binding score belong to CPC. In other words, CPC is the major source of peptides that bind to HLA loci with more affinity. These observations suggest that greater emphasis must be placed on cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response generated by the presentation of antigen by B alleles and should design epitope-based vaccine directed towards these HLA.
T cell epitopes specific to multiple HLA supertypes are advantageous for vaccine design because they effectively increase the number of epitopes to which an individual can respond, and provide much more extensive coverage of the population (33 ) . The peptides binding to more than one HLA are termed promiscuous and such peptides are of prime interest for vaccine design because of their relevance in coverage of higher proportions of human populations. In silico approaches would help to predict some of the HLA-binding motifs, which could act as promiscuous epitopes (34 ) . Most of the generated nonameric peptides in this work are mono-allelic binders. To cover majority of the population, it is essential to have vaccine candidates that have multi-binding behavior. Consequently, peptides with the binding ability of ≥4 supertypes were taken as promiscuous epitopes. Note that each supertype consists of multiple HLA alleles, and peptides that can bind to ≥4 supertypes have a great potentiality to activate the most proportion of T cell population.
It is generally recognized that conserved protein sequences represent important functional domains (35 ) , for which mutations would be detrimental to the survival of the pathogen. The functions of conserved sequences can be elucidated by databases that comprise data on protein families, domains and functional sites, such as the Pfam database (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam) (36 ) . In Figure  2 , in addition to the ClustalW consensus sequence, the results of the Pfam database and the highly conserved regions that have ≥9 amino acids in length have also been shown. It is clear that the predicted epitopes located in the conserved segments have more validity.
Eventually, identification of proteins with peptides binding to larger number of alleles, assessment of alleles or supertypes of MHC that bind large number of peptides than others have great importance in determining epitopes as a candidate vaccine. In addition, allelic variation in binding affinity, immunologi-cal hotspots, HLA distribution analysis and similarity of epitopes to the self proteins play a key role in identification of these epitopes (34) (35) (36) .
In proteins, turns are located on the surface; these parts are accessible and hydrophilic but the core regions are mostly devoid of water molecules (37 ) . Antigenic determinants lie in regions that are hydrophilic, exposed and polar, while accessibility and flexibility of these segments are high. This has led to the rules that would allow the position of B cell epitopes to be predicted from these features of the protein sequence (37 , 38 ) .
In conclusion, recognizing epitopes on proteins is essential for developing synthetic vaccines and can facilitate immunotherapy of leishmaniasis and many other infectious diseases. In the present work, employing a bioinformatics approach, a set of peptides has been identified, which can be used in either a natural or a synthetic vaccine cocktail. This approach could be extended to the entire proteome of L. major to identify newer sets of potentially antigenic proteins and yet reducing the number of T and B cell antigens for experimental verification. These kinds of researches can be applied for omitting non-functional sequences of proteins, which would help in designing new immunological methods.
The sequences of ten cysteine proteases (clan CA, family C1) of L. major were obtained from GeneDB database (www.genedb.org) (39 ) .
Sequences included one CPA (Systematic ID: LmjF19.1420), one CPC (LmjF29.0820) and eight CPBs (LmjF08.1010, LmjF08.1020, LmjF08.1030, LmjF08.1040, LmjF08. 1050, LmjF08.1060, LmjF08.1070 and LmjF08.1080).
NetCTL program version 1.2 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/NetCTL/) (40 ) predicts peptides restricted to 12 HLA class I supertypes (A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B39, B44, B58 and B62), integrated with predictions of HLA binding, proteasomal C-terminal cleavage and transport efficiency by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) molecules. HLA binding and proteasomal cleavage predictions were performed by an artificial neural networks (ANN) method and TAP transport efficiency was predicted using a weight matrix method. The parameters used for NetCTL prediction were: 0.15 weight on C terminal cleavage, 0.05 weight on TAP transport efficiency, and 0.75 threshold for HLA supertype binding. The final scores are the predicted MHC class I affinities in form of −logIC50 and IC50 values.
All prediction calculations were based on propensity scales for each of the 20 amino acids. Sequence of each protein was read as a moving window. In order to compare the profiles obtained by different methods, various scales were normalized where the original values of each scale were set between +3 and −3. Hydrophilicity (41 ), flexibility (42 ) , accessibility (43 ) , turns (44 ), exposed surface (45 ), polarity (46 ) and antigenic propensity (47 ) scales were applied to predict B cell epitopes by BcePred server (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/bcepred) with default threshold.
Due to the elimination of signal peptides of CPBs before secretion to the outer space of the infected cells, this region must be excluded from the entire sequence of the protein for exerting the prediction analysis on it. Signal peptide prediction was achieved using SignalP 3.0 HMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/SignalP-3.0/) (48 ) .
Putative promiscuous T cell epitopes may be localized in clusters that are also ideal for developing epitopebased vaccines because they contain multiple promiscuous epitopes. For determining the immunogenic hotspots, MULTIPRED server (http://antigen.i2r.astar.edu.sg/multipred/) (49 ) was utilized.
Sequences were aligned using ClustalW program (50 ) from the BioEdit v5.0.9 package (51 ).","Computational Analysis of Cysteine Proteases (Clan CA, Family C1) of Leishmania major to Find Potential Epitopic Regions","Saffari, Babak; Mohabatkar, Hassan",Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5054412/,101,2725,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,1430ebabc4bb953366b635cd4a8adf9956c2f86b,"Context: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a widespread pediatric disease caused primarily by human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). Objective: This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia. Data Sources: PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others. Results: HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood: No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis. Limitations: Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology. Conclusions: Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.
Key Words: hand, foot and mouth disease, EV-A71, CV-A16, epidemiology (Pediatr Infect Dis J 2016;35:e285-e300) H and, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has become an endemic childhood disease in East and Southeast Asia. Its main etiologic agents are human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus 16 (CV-A16). Although usually mild-with symptoms limited to >38°C fever, malaise, rashes on the volar regions of the hands and feet, herpangina and difficulty eating and drinking-more rarely, infection can lead to complications of the nervous or cardiopulmonary systems. Such cases can result in long-term sequelae such as cognitive and motor disorders 1,2 or death, usually from pulmonary edema or brainstem encephalitis. 3 Although complications are rare, the number of children being infected in high-incidence countries such as China (≈2.7 M cases in 2014 3 ) means the death toll can be substantial (384 deaths in China in 2014 3 ). The EV-A71 virus seems to be responsible for more severe outcomes, while CV-A16 and other Coxsackieviruses, such as CV-A2, CV-A6 and CV-A10, usually present milder symptoms that resolve within a few weeks. [4] [5] [6] There are nearly 25 years of literature from Asia that describes the epidemiology of HFMD, drawing on pediatric cohorts, national surveillance systems, outbreak investigations and clinical data, and from disparate countries that span stages of economic development and with climates that range from tropical to temperate. This diversity complicates attempts to identify general features of HFMD epidemiology and conceals gaps in the body of knowledge of this important pediatric disease.
The objective of this paper is to provide a robust systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD that informs public health policy making about HFMD epidemics. The review covers 3 major areas: (1) history and seasonality of HFMD, and the efforts in predictive modeling; (2) risk factors for infection, to guide control and (3) global epidemiologic parameters, such as the incubation period and basic reproduction number, which may determine the effectiveness of control policies.","Underground and aggregated at a weekly scale. Incidence data from Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore were extracted from routine surveillance data published by government agencies (the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan 7 ; the Department of Health, Hong Kong 8 ; the Taiwan National Infectious Disease Statistics System 9 and the Ministry of Health, Singapore).
Nontabular data were extracted from figures using Plot Digitizer. 10 Data on weather and incidence were analyzed using a time series model. Symptomatic proportions were pooled by aggregating denominators and numerators. Other analyses used standard statistical methods and were conducted using R. 11 
Outbreaks of HFMD do not occur uniformly throughout the year across Asia. In Fukuoka, Japan, for example, weekly numbers of HFMD cases have been found to increase with average temperature and humidity, especially among younger children. 12 By digitizing the incidence data from publications on Japan 5,12-14 and North China [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] (Fig. 1) , we observe that May through July are the months with highest incidence in temperate regions of Asia. However, this relationship is less clear for tropical and subtropical Asia. The extracted data on Southwest China, 15, 21 South China, 2, 15, 22, 23 Hong Kong 24, 25 and Taiwan [26] [27] [28] show that outbreaks typically happen in late spring and fall. No distinct pattern is obvious for tropical regions as seen from data in Thailand, [29] [30] [31] Vietnam, 32, 33 Malaysia 34 and Singapore, [35] [36] [37] [38] where outbreaks occur sporadically throughout the year, although models have been developed for Singapore (≈1° north) that show a positive statistical relationship between maximum daily temperature above 32°C with HFMD incidence in the subsequent 1-2 weeks. 37 To assess how general the relationship between climate and transmissibility of HFMD was, we took incidence data from Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore (Fig. 2, Appendix 1) , that is, spanning temperate, subtropical and tropical latitudes, and fitted time series models to them. After controlling for contagion via autoregression terms, the effect of meteorologic factors was weak: a small positive increase in transmissibility with rising absolute humidity/temperature during the current week in Tokyo and Singapore. There was no evidence for temperature and humidity in having the same effect in Hong Kong or Taiwan, although rising relative humidity seems to decrease transmissibility in Singapore.
The earliest recorded cases of HFMD in Asia are from Japan (1967), 30 Singapore (1970) , 31 Taiwan (1980) 32 and Shanghai, China (1981) . 33 Since then, outbreaks have been reported in many parts of Asia, including mainland China, [12] [13] [14] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] Korea, [53] [54] [55] Japan, [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] Taiwan, 6, 69, [71] [72] [73] [74] Hong Kong, 17, 18, 75 India, [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] Thailand, 21, 23, 82 Vietnam, 24 Malaysia, 26, 69, [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] Singapore 4, 88 and Brunei, 89 as summarized in Figure 3 . These reported outbreaks are unlikely to reflect the true first outbreaks of HFMD, as serologic studies provide evidence that by the time surveillance systems were established, EV-A71 and CV-A16 were already endemic in many of these countries. Early serologic tests conducted in Japan in 1970 show evidence of EV-A71 and CV-A16 circulation. 90 Serum taken in the late 1990s in Singapore, before the start of surveillance in 2000, shows that around 50% children and 44% cord blood, indicating maternal infection, had already seroconverted to EV-A71. 91 Blood samples from Taiwan (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) show 3%-11% EV-A71 incidence per year, and up to 68% of children 92 had serologic evidence of EV-A71 infection before the large HFMD outbreak of 1997. Similarly, although China has reported millions of HFMD cases since the beginning of the HFMD surveillance program in 2008, evidence from Anhui 47 shows high seroprevalence of up to 74.6% in older children before the 2008 outbreaks. Retrospective seroepidemiologic tests from blood serum collected in 2005 93 also show that China had positive rates of 32.0% to EV-A71 and 43.4% to CV-A16, indicating that outbreaks happened earlier but were simply not reported in the literature.
Risk factors for infection are depicted in Figure 4 (Appendix 2) and summarized below.
Evidence from Qiaosi, China, 94 indicates the importance of hygiene for protection against HFMD infection. Children who always wash their hands before meals are about 50 times less likely to contract HFMD, while those whose caregivers wash their hands before feeding are about 25 times less likely. Additional protective habits include washing of hands after play, washing of hands more than 4 times per day, using soap, and not sucking fingers.
A study in Korea 95 14 showed that sunshine could be protective against HFMD. This is agreed by a matched case-control study of preschoolers in Beijing, 41 which showed that UV radiation in classrooms is associated with lower HFMD attack rate (P value of 0.027), and recommended installing UV lamps to sterilize unoccupied classrooms. These findings are, however, inconsistent with the seasonal nature of HFMD, where outbreaks in temperate countries tend to occur in summer, when sunlight and UV exposure are strongest.
The age distribution of HFMD cases in Asia, compiled from a variety of sources including surveillance and cohort data, is summarized in Figure 5 . Data from China [12] [13] [14] 34, [49] [50] [51] [52] 94, [100] [101] [102] [103] [105] [106] [107] and Taiwan 5,6,73,108-111 are particularly abundant. Other sources include Hong Kong, 17, 18 India, 76, 80 Japan, 56, 112 Korea, 54, 95 Malaysia, 84, 113 Singapore, 4, 27, 88 Thailand 22, 23 and Vietnam. 24 The symptomatic HFMD incidence rate varies widely even within the narrow 0-to 6 
The literature is ambiguous about the importance of locations for transmission. Four studies showed that contact with a case, particularly a household member, is as or more significant a risk factor than preschool attendance. 21, 88, 96, 108 An early study in Singapore observed 60 families with secondary cases and found . Middle and bottom panels show mean daily temperature, absolute and relative humidity at Tokyo Narita, Hong Kong International, Taipei Taoyuan International and Singapore Changi airports, downloaded from the Weather Underground. Bottom: Coefficients of meteorological variables at 0-2 week time lags in autoregressive models of Z-scored HFMD case counts to facilitate comparison between locations. Each city is analyzed separately using a model in which HFMD incidence in week t is (auto)regressed on incidence in weeks t-1 up to t-3 (using the Akaike information criterion to select the order of the autoregression component) and, independently, on each meteorological variable. Weather parameters are not regressed together in a single model because of collinearity. The effect of weather on HFMD incidence can be seen by coefficient mean (points) and 95% confidence intervals (lines), colored red if statistically significant at the 5% level.
the secondary attack rate amongst children below 12 years old to be 77%. 88 Similarly, in a large seroepidemiologic study of EV-A71 in Taiwanese children, 96 multivariate analysis showed attendance at a preschool imparted a similar magnitude of risk as contact with a case [adjusted ORs: 1.6 (1.2-2.1) and 1.8 (1.3-2.5), respectively], as well as a strong concordance (84%) between seropositivity in younger and older siblings.
Also, a number of studies showed that a higher percentage of diagnoses occurred among children who did not attend a nursery or preschool. 37, 51 Liu et al 49 note that about half of symptomatic cases in Nanchang, China, are among children under 3 years, the age at which preschooling starts in China.
Conversely, some studies suggest that preschool attendance is a key risk factor. 4, 114 For example, a seroepidemiologic study in 1996 to 1997 in Singapore showed that seropositivity to EV-A71 increases rapidly from age 2 to 5, 91 when attendance at childcare or preschool is the norm. Also, a case-control study in Japan 114 showed that preschool attendance was associated with increased risk of severe disease.
Other studies suggest that both locations are important. In Shanghai, China, 103 there was a marked shift from 2007 to 2008 in the proportion of cases among children in preschools (from 59% to 37%) with a concurrent shift from local to migrant children, suggesting that the importance of routes of transmission can vary over time within the same locale. A case-control study from Zhejiang 94 showed that although attending preschool is a risk factor (OR: 2.1), other factors such as contact with neighbors (OR: 11), going to hospital (OR: 20) and going to parties (OR: 31) impart greater risk. Yet, a Korean case-control study 95 found no significant relationship between infection and school attendance or household size.
Overall, the evidence points to both home and school environments contributing to transmission, but the relative importance of these venues remains murky.
Several papers describe the incubation period (Fig. 5 , Appendix 3) though it is striking that the majority do not provide a source to justify the claimed period. These unsupported claims vary substantially from paper to paper, from the incubation period ""is"" 3-6 days 115 or 3-7 days, 76 ""is usually 3-4 days, but can be ... 10 days or more,"" 32 or ""is usually 3-5 days (range, 2-12 days),"" 111 is ""typically"" 3-7 days 116 or 3-5 days, 49 ranges from 5 to 7 days 42,98 or 3 to 7 days 113 and the ""usual period"" is 3-5 days ""with longest period of 7 days."" 117 Only a few provide evidence to justify the claim: one reports 95 that the incubation period is usually 3-7 days, citing a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) factsheet on aseptic meningitis. Another cites 118 an early study from Singapore, 88 which presented the median and range for the serial interval (3 days [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ), not the incubation period. Another early study 119 states that the incubation period is ""said to be"" 3-5 days, but notes that this is inconsistent with the serial interval observed in the study. It appears that there is no empirical support whatsoever for any distribution of incubation periods.
Although several studies report that the asymptomatic rate of EV-A71 infection is high, few studies report data (Table 1) . Two studies, from Taiwan and Shanghai, tested sera for evidence of EV-A71 infection and asked patients or their families to recall past HFMD infection, deriving estimates of 29% 120 and 10% 106 of symptomatic infection, respectively. Some HFMD cases may have been caused by other enteroviruses, biasing these estimates upwards, while some may have been diagnosed as another viral illness or forgotten, biasing them downwards.
Two additional studies in Taiwan found much higher symptomatic infection rates. The first 108 study recruited symptomatic cases suspected of having EV-A71 infection, and took throat and rectal swabs or stool samples, of cases and their household members. Signs and symptoms of the entire household were monitored with follow-up telephone interviews. Excluding the 94 symptomatic index cases, 68% of confirmed infections in the household were symptomatic (88% of infected children and 47% of infected adults). A second study 121 prospectively followed a cohort of neonates over 3 years, taking repeat sera, requesting that parents report suspected HFMD and giving reminders during HFMD epidemics. This study found that 71% of serologically confirmed infections were symptomatic, though the sample size is only 28.
The discrepancy between these 2 pairs of papers is substantial, undoubtedly because of differences in methodology. An overall estimate, combining the 4 studies, is 36% (33%-39%), but given the large discrepancy between studies, this estimate does not appear reliable. The latter pair of studies is prospective, thereby circumventing recall bias, and thus appear to provide a more accurate description of the epidemiology of enterovirus infection.
Only 3 papers have sought to estimate the reproduction number for HFMD or the viruses that cause it. One paper 101 estimates what they call the ""local effective reproduction number"" in Chinameaning using the average number of secondary cases from a randomly selected index to estimate the cases that would be caused in a fully susceptible population (note, this is substantially different from the effective reproduction number 122 in a partially susceptible population)-using a sophisticated Poisson regression model that incorporated infection from the environment, the prefecture and neighboring prefectures. This model did not, however, account for the accumulation of herd immunity and required arbitrary assignment of the infectious period, so the estimated local effective reproduction number of 1.1-1.2 during peak periods may be biased.
A second paper 117 used a method from Choi and Pak 123 to estimate the basic reproduction number to be 5.5 (interquartile range, 4.2-6.5) for EV-A71 and 2.5 (interquartile range, 2.0-3.7) for CV-A16. These estimates are likely inaccurate because the method assumes (i) a known generation time distribution, labeled incubation period in the paper; (ii) a completely immunonaïve population, though applied to groups of individuals for whom past exposure was highly plausible and (iii) an early exponential growth period, despite being applied to complete outbreak data.
The third paper 124 attempted to estimate the reproduction number using a SEIQRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Quarantined, Recovered) simulation model and obtained an estimate of 1.1 for the years 2009 to 2012 in China. However, the model used 10% of China population as the initial susceptible population, but did not conduct a sensitivity analysis on this vital parameter.
Despite the substantial number of papers on HFMD, this systematic review shows that many fundamental questions about EV-A71 and CV-A16 persist. Both viruses occur year round in tropical Asia, but are epidemic in the summer in Northeast Asia. A role for temperature or humidity therefore seems Distributions within age ranges were assumed to be constant. The black dots are average proportion for that age (with 95% CI). Right: Reported incubation periods for HFMD, by year of publication and provision of evidence to support claimed period. Lines indicate that the incubation period ""is X days."" Gray bars indicate that the incubation period is ""usually"" or ""typically"" X days. Gray bars with lines shows an extended interval ""can be up to X days."" The point indicates a median. Notes: (1) provides information within the paper, which is inconsistent in this estimate; (2) uses generation interval distribution as a proxy for incubation period; (3) cites a US CDC factsheet on aseptic meningitis, which in turn provides no supporting evidence and (4) cites Goh et al. 88 CI indicates confidence interval. plausible, 14,125-128 although given the relative lack of seasonality in equatorial Asia, it is not clear whether prediction of outbreaks is possible there. In Japan, summer temperatures peak after HFMD incidence does, suggesting correlation but not temporality, and that it may not be possible to provide early warning of impending epidemics. This also differs from other human enteric viruses including poliovirus 1 (also an enterovirus), hepatitis A and adenovirus that have been shown to survive longer on colder surfaces. 129 Urashima et al 125 claimed that enteroviruses experience a more rapid virus decline during dry seasons than during wet seasons, which could explain the seasonality. This result is supported by Wang et al, 130 where they showed that precipitation patterns has the most similar structure as HFMD incidence, more so than other meteorologic variables, albeit with only 11 months of data.
While any causal relationship between climate and HFMD is unknown, speculations include a lower HFMD incidence because of decreased social contact during temperate zones' winter. 118, 131 In contrast, increased social contacts during winter have been speculated to facilitate spread of other droplet-borne diseases, such as influenza, 132 which are epidemic in winter. Given the unknowns surrounding this issue, further research is clearly required to ascertain whether meteorologic factors or seasonal social contact patterns is an adequate explanation for the seasonality of HFMD.
The next step to analyzing the dynamics of HFMD seasonality is likely to involve social and environmental factors, another under-researched area for this pediatric disease. For instance, the literature is unclear on the relative importance of school versus community transmission, with evidence to support both, yet knowledge of where HFMD most often is transmitted is important as school closure policies are employed to control outbreaks in some countries. Further, the environment of schools in Asia may vary widely, and attributes such as hygiene practices should be characterized and quantified to allow more definitive results and conclusions in future studies.
Even without being able to determine the relative importance of school versus community transmission, the effectiveness of school closure to prevent large-scale HFMD outbreaks is questionable, as the interruption to social networks cannot be enforced while children are out of school. Additionally, although we know little about the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases of HFMD, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic is substantial, and so even quite modest school closure attack rate thresholds, such as Singapore's 25%, 133 corresponds to a possible majority of students being infected before the trigger for closure being met. Further, EV-A71 can be found in fecal samples for up to 54 days after infection, 134 and thus continue to be shed after a school is closed, disinfected and reopened.
Studies on risk factors were rare, and we identified only 3 papers that describe risk factors for hygiene and contact patterns, making a meta-analysis of risk factors unfeasible. These typically were only powered to provide unadjusted effect sizes, and so provide evidence of correlation, not causation. One interesting finding was the apparent protective effect of a caregiver ""always washing"" their hands. This suggests that adult to child transmission might be important, even if adults are mostly asymptomatic with EV-A71 and CV-A16, but may reflect confounding with general hygiene. Future work may elicit hygiene factors at the preschool level and relate these to attack rates.
A recently developed EV-A71 vaccine has undergone phase 3 trials in China. [135] [136] [137] To determine the cost-effectiveness of incorporating the vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules, or of other interventions such as school closure or isolation, would require epidemiologic models that account for the protective effects of herd immunity. However, this review indicates that vital parameters for such models remain unknown. The asymptomatic rate and relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases are both poorly known, while estimates of the incubation period, although commonly cited as 3-5 days, appear to be based solely on expert opinion. Most importantly, estimates of the basic reproduction number range widely from 1.1 to 5.5. This uncertainty prohibits utilitarian estimation of the necessary vaccine coverage to prevent epidemics of EV-A71.
To reconcile the differences between the disparate estimates, the age distributions of the samples need to be considered. As shown in this review, symptomatic HFMD incidence rate differ greatly even between ages 0 and 6, and thus, studies conducted predominantly on preschoolers may derive higher estimates of R 0 compared with studies in older children. Accordingly, future studies on HFMD should use narrower age bands and also state the distribution clearly to allow adjustments or standardization.
Two final omissions from the literature are quantitative estimates of the impact of infection on complications, child and caregiver absenteeism and costings of complications, and qualitative evidence on the impact of infection and enforced isolation on families and schools. Given the promising direct effects of the EV-A71 vaccine and the huge public health impacts of HFMD in East and Southeast Asia, research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.
The research questions in this systematic review were generally answered only by a limited number of papers, with substantial differences in their study design, and thus, most data were not synthesized through meta-analysis. More research to assess risk factors and measure key epidemiologic parameters is needed. We were also unable to trace the earliest cases of HFMD in Asia as our scope only covers published material on outbreaks, which leads us back to 1967 in Japan. Finally, we limited the scope of this study to exclude virologic characteristics or molecular epidemiology, which have been well reviewed elsewhere, 116, [138] [139] [140] [141] and clinical manifestations of EV-A71 and CV-A16. 28, 116, 138, 141, 142 A recent review of the case-fatality rate has recently been published, 143 as has a review of the epidemiology in Taiwan. 144
An autoregressive (AR) model was used to investigate the effect of meteorological variables after correcting for contagion via autoregression.
A lag 2 model can be specified as follows:
The A coefficients are the coefficients for the AR terms, while the B coefficients represent how a change in weather is correlated with changes in HFMD incidence. The number of lag terms is determined by the Akaike information criterion values of the regression models.
This same model was used for 4 countries-Japan (lag 2), Hong Kong (lag 3), Taiwan (lag 3) and Singapore (lag 2)-and for 3 meteorological parameters-temperature, absolute humidity and relative humidity. As this model carries autocorrelated terms, we used generalized least squares for model fitting. Coefficients from the fitted models are presented in Tables A1-A3 . The outcome variable is the number of reported HFMD cases per sentinel per week (Japan), the number of reported HFMD cases per general practitioner per week (Hong Kong), the number of reported severe enterovirus cases per week (Taiwan) and the number of reported HFMD cases per week (Singapore). To facilitate comparability, the incidence measures were standardized to have mean 0 and variance 1.
CI indicates confidence interval. The outcome variable is the same as the temperature model. Coefficients for autoregressive model using temperature as predictor. The AR coefficients are generally statistically significant across models. Significant AR terms indicate that incidence is highly autocorrelated, which is expected as the contagious nature of HFMD is the primary driver of temporal patterns of incidence. The primary parameters of interest are the coefficients of the meteorological variables, which represent how much temperature/humidity affects the Z-score of incidence, after controlling for contagion. The results are tabulated in Tables A1-A3, summarized in Figure 1 and the paper itself. Incidence data are obtained from various sources, summarized in Table A4 . For Japan and Hong Kong, ""cases per sentinel"" and ""cases per consultation"" are used instead of the actual number of notified cases because these data are from voluntary sentinel reporting. Thus, actual notified cases will increase with an increase of GP sentinel participation rate. CI indicates confidence interval.

46,f12dac6dd672f51fbf89bec56df7f7a8af5331df,"BACKGROUND: Cases of H1N1 and other pulmonary infections evolve to acute respiratory failure and death when co-infections or lung injury predominate over the immune response, thus requiring early diagnosis to improve treatment.
To perform a detailed histopathological analysis of the open lung biopsy specimens from five patients with ARDS with confirmed H1N1.
Lung specimens underwent microbiologic analysis, and examination by optical and electron microscopy. Immunophenotyping was used to characterize macrophages, natural killer, T and B cells, and expression of cytokines and iNOS.
The pathological features observed were necrotizing bronchiolitis, diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage and abnormal immune response. Ultrastructural analysis showed viral-like particles in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Viral-like particles can be successfully demonstrated in lung tissue by ultrastructural examination, without confirmation of the virus by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Bronchioles and epithelium, rather than endothelium, are probably the primary target of infection, and diffuse alveolar damage the consequence of the effect of airways obliteration and dysfunction on innate immunity, suggesting that treatment should be focused on epithelial repair. MIS. Pathological and ultrastructural analysis of surgical lung biopsies in patients with swine-origin influenza type A/H1N1 and acute respiratory failure.","Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus with molecular features of North American and Eurasian swine, avian, and human influenza viruses [1] [2] [3] [4] has been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 25 April and 11 October 2009, 399,232 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza virus and 4,735 deaths occurred throughout the world. 5 Brazil reported 1,528 deaths up to 10 November 2009. 6 Swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection can cause severe acute respiratory failure (ARF), requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in 15-30% of previously healthy young to middle-aged people. 3, 4, 7, 8 Death may occur when co-infections or lung injury prevail over the immune response, resulting in a progressive worsening of lung function (low compliance and oxygenation). Early diagnosis and a complete understanding of the pathological features of the H1N1 virus are important to help to improve treatment and the prognosis of this lethal disease. Analysis of the lung tissue from an open lung biopsy (OLB) of these severe cases can help in understanding the pathogenesis of this severe and sometimes fatal development. Until now, no reports of OLB findings used to guide the treatment of patients with H1N1 pneumonitis have been published, although according to many authors OLB is safe and diagnostically useful in patients with ARF, enabling appropriate therapy. [9] [10] [11] [12] The pathogenesis of ARF associated with swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) infection in humans is unknown. The influenza virus triggers pulmonary inflammation owing to an infiltration of inflammatory cells and an immune response. Bronchial epithelial cells are the primary target and the principal host for the virus. 13, 14 Normally, influenza viruses are recognized and destroyed by innate immune mechanisms which involve macrophages, interferon (IFN) a, b and other cytokines, natural killer (NK) cells and complement. When influenza viruses escape from these early defense mechanisms, they are captured and eliminated by adaptive immune mechanisms, where T and B cells and their antigen-specific effectors (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, cytokines such as IFNc and antibodies) target the virus. Additionally, antigen-specific memory cells (T and B cells) are involved in the prevention of the subsequent viral infection. 14 Thus, pathological findings obtained by an OLB, coupled to ultrastructural and immunologic analysis, may have an impact on decisions about changes in treatment strategies employed for these critically ill patients, and also provide a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of S-OIV infection. The objective of this study was to analyze pathologically and ultrastructurally S-OIV lung infection and the pulmonary immune response in a series of five cases with OLB.
We studied pathologically and ultrastructurally five patients suspected of having a pandemic S-OIV virus who developed ARF requiring ventilatory support. Nasal swabs for RT-PCR for H1N1 were collected from all patients. The OLBs indicated by the clinicians were carried out after receiving consent from the families. These patients had a severe evolution of the virus and more information about the physiopathology of the disease was required in order to provide adequate treatment. If no improvement of the respiratory status was seen in the patients with ARF after $5 days (defined as no decrease of the Lung Injury Score) an OLB was indicated. 15 Lung tissue sections (4 mm thick), prepared from 10% formalin-fixed, routinely processed, paraffin-embedded blocks, were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The following methods of histochemical staining were carried out: Grocott's methenamine silver stain, Brown-Brenn, and Ziehl-Neelsen. The following pathological changes were analyzed: a) necrotizing bronchiolitis, b) alveolar collapse, c) dilatation of the airspaces, d) hyaline membrane, e) fibroplasia, f) squamous metaplasia, g) multinucleated cells, h) alveolar hemorrhage, i) acute inflammatory exudates, j) atypical pneumocytes. Pathological changes were graded, using two sections, according to a five-point semiquantitative severity-based scoring system as: 0 = normal lung parenchyma, 1 = changes in 1-25%, 2 = changes in 26-50%, 3 = changes in 51-75%, and 4 = changes in 76-100% of examined tissue. This semiquantitative analysis is currently routinely used in most studies of the department of pathology of the University of Sã o Paulo Medical School. 16, 17 For immunohistochemistry, the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex and streptavidin-biotin enzyme complex immunostaining methods were used with antibodies against: lymphocytes CD4 (clone: MO834, dilution 1:1000), CD8 (clone: M7103, dilution 120), CD20 (clone: M755, dilution 140), macrophages-histiocytes CD68 (clone: M814, dilution 130), mouse monoclonal antibodies from DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA; S100 (clone: Z311, dilution 11000) rabbit polyclonal antibodies from DAKO; CD1a (clone: MCA1657, dilution 1: 200) mouse monoclonal antibodies from Serotec, Oxford, UK; natural killer, NK (clone: MS136P, dilution 11000) mouse monoclonal antibodies from Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA; interleukin 4 (IL-4) (dilution 140), IL-10 (dilution 140) goat polyclonal antibodies from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; IFNc (clone: MAB285, dilution 130), mouse monoclonal antibodies from R&D Systems; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) (clone: AF210NA, dilution 140) all mouse monoclonal antibodies from R&D Systems; inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (dilution 1500) polyclonal rabbit from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA.
Immunohistochemical reactions were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction. Diaminobenzidine was used as the color substrate, and Meyer's hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. Cell immunophenotypes and immune expression of cells using the different methods of immunohistochemical staining were identified and graded according to a five-point semiquantitative intensity-based scoring system as: 0 = negative, 1 = positive in 1-25%, 2 = positive in 26-50%, 3 = positive in 51-75%, and 4 = positive in 76-100% of examined tissue. 18 Small blocks (1 mm 3 ) of lungs were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in cacodylate buffer overnight, then fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in araldite. Ultrathin sections obtained from selected areas were double-stained and examined in a Philips TECNAI 10 electron microscope at 80 kV. For each electron microscopy image (15/case), the following structural changes were analyzed: a) cytoplasmic swelling, b) degenerative changes, c) sloughing of necrotizing alveolar epithelial cell type I (AECI) and II (AECII), d) denudation of the epithelial basement membrane, e) hyaline membranes, f) alveolar septal collapse, g) viral particles such as tubuloreticular structures (TRS) and cylindrical confronting cisternae (CCC), h) multinucleated AECII. Ultrastructural findings were graded according to a five-point semiquantitative severity-based scoring system as: 0 = normal lung parenchyma, 1 = changes in 1-25%, 2 = changes in 26-50%, 3 = changes in 51-75%, and 4 = changes in 76-100% of examined tissue. 16, 17 
Five patients (two male, three female) mean age 48 years (range 35-81) were studied; only patient No 4 had preexisting medical illnesses (Table 1) and chest x-ray abnormality at disease onset. All the patients presented with a 4-10 days' (median 5 days) history of shortness of breath and flu-like symptoms and rapid clinical deterioration. They were transferred to the ICU for tracheal intubation and ventilation (range 8-25 days; median 17) and diagnosed as having ARF. 15 All the patients received 75 mg twice a day by nasal enteral tube of olsetamivir (range 4-14 days; median 10) and intravenous steroids (range 9-20 days; median 12). After obtaining these results the dose was changed from 75 mg twice a day to 150 mg twice a day through a nasal enteral tube, in accordance with the Brazilian guidelines. The presence of the H1N1 virus was confirmed in all five patients (Table 1) by nasal swab or lung tissue positivity of RT-PCR according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 19 Other microbiological investigations, including the isolation of other viruses, were negative. During the evolution of disease in the patients in the ICU, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from a blood culture (patients 2 and 3) and Klebsiella spp were identified in tracheal aspirate specimens (patient 1). Patients 1, 2 and 4 are alive, but patients 3 and 5 died of respiratory failure, with concurrent congestive heart failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and acute renal failure. Table 2) . Pulmonary specimens from patients 3 and 5 presented more intense changes at optical microscopy. The membranous and respiratory bronchioles were extensively compromised by epithelial necrosis, squamous metaplasia, and obliteration by fibroplasia ( Figure 1A -F). The parenchyma was modified by extensive alveolar collapse, dilatation of the airspaces, alveolar hemorrhage, and sparse hyaline membrane formation ( Figure 1G -I). There was interstitial thickening, with mild to moderate fibroplasia ( Figure 1I ), but a disproportionately sparse infiltrate of inflammatory cells, mainly histiocytes, including multinucleated forms, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes ( Figure 1J-K) .
Atypical bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) were seen in all five patients, although the distribution was focal ( Figure 1J ). These atypical forms included multinucleated giant cells with irregularly distributed nuclei ( Figure 1K , L) or bronchiolar and AECs with large atypical nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, and granular amphophilic cytoplasm ( Figure 1M ). However, distinct viral inclusions were not apparent.
The ultrastructural features were represented by bronchial and alveolar epithelium necrosis, a destroyed alveolar epithelium/basement membrane unity and the presence of viral-like particles (Table 3) . Patients 3 and 5 presented more prominent changes at submicroscopic level. Cytoplasmic swelling, necrosis, and degenerative changes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles were present in bronchial and AECs (Figure 2A-C) . A large number of bronchiolar and AECs were detached from the basement membrane and were showing apoptosis (Figure 2A, B) . Lymphocytes also exhibited apoptosis. Sloughing of apoptotic bronchiolar cells and AECs causing denudation of the epithelial basement membrane was followed by deposition of hyaline membranes ( Figure 2D ).
Ultrastructural evidence of alveolar collapse was also present by the apposition of the alveolar septa ( Figure 2E -G). The regenerating bronchiolar epithelium extended along the adjacent alveolar septa showing features of cells with prominent surface microvilli with decreased or absent lamellar bodies and considerable cytologic atypia ( Figure 2H -L). Increased myofibroblasts and collagen fibers were also present ( Figure 2I ). Multinucleated epithelial cells with prominent nucleoli were noted in most cases, although such cells were sparse ( Figure 2K ). The proliferating bronchiolar and AECs containing TRS and CCC, probably representing residual viral-like particles, were distinguished in all cases ( Figure 2M -R). TRS appeared as reticular aggregates of branching membranous tubules located within the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum ( Figure 2M -O) or were compact ( Figure 2Q , R). CCC were identified as elongated, slightly curved cylindrical structures ( Figure 2P , Q), ring shaped ( Figure 2R ) or fused membranous lamellae, representing cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. (Table 4) . Patients 3 and 5 presented with immunologic impairment.
In all patients small aggregates of macrophages, CD4+ Thelper cells, CD8+ T-cytotoxic cells, CD20+ B-cells, CD1a+ dendritic cells, S100+ dendritic cells, natural killer lymphocytes were present around vessels and bronchioles. Dendritic cells and TNFa were expressed sparsely in macrophages, AECs and endothelial cells, whereas IFNc was expressed in small mononucleated cells in lungs from patients with S-OIV. There was a very strong expression of IL-4, IL-10 and iNOS in small mononucleated cells.
This case series documents for the first time the pathological and ultrastructural findings of lung tissue from five patients admitted to the ICU with ARF and S-OIV infection who were submitted to OLB.
S-OIV (H1N1) virus and the pulmonary syndrome is an acute respiratory illness, first identified in Mexico with at present, 399,232 cases registered, 4,735 deaths, affecting more than 179 countries. 2, 5 Our patients, most of them previously healthy, had an atypical influenza-like illness that progressed during a period of 5-7 days.
The two patients who died showed a higher degree of pathological commitment of the disease at the OLB. Most of our patients were young to middle-aged and had previously been healthy. Increased risk for severe S-OIV illness is found in young children, 10-19 age groups, patients older than 65 years, pregnant women, obese people and those with comorbidities. 1, 7, 20 Fifteen to thirty per cent of patients with H1N1 infection required ICU admission. Mortality among the patients who required mechanical ventilation was around 58%. 7 In our case series the OLB findings showed that the lung damage was most likely due to infection by the influenza virus. The main pathological finding revealed necrotizing bronchiolitis and DAD, respiratory epithelial cells probably being the primary target of the infection. The extensive destruction of the respiratory and AECs and dysfunction in the immune and adaptative immune response led to DAD. As previously reported, possible mechanisms of damage include direct injury to the respiratory and alveolar epithelium exposing the basement membrane and leading to alveolar collapse by loss of surfactant, 13,14,21 with a secondary cytokine storm. 22 This is followed by exudation of macromolecules from the circulation, which finally form hyaline membranes. Activation of the cytokines is part of the immune reaction aiming to eradicate the virus. In this study, the systemic IFNc and TNFa cytokine activation probably resulted in reactive hemophagocytic syndrome in the bronchiole-associated lymphoid tissue and possibly also mediated the epithelial necrosis. 23 A mild inflammatory infiltration is most often seen in viral pneumonias; this has been explained by a cytokine-mediated blockade of lymphocytopoiesis and also by blockade of release from the bone marrow. 24 In our cases, expression in the lung of IFNc by small mononucleated cells and TNFa by macrophages and AECs was low. This finding may be supported by Kim and colleagues, 25 Conversely, we found a very strong expression of IL-4, IL-10 and iNOS by macrophages. The sparse inflammatory and immune reaction found in our samples, which involves targetting of the virus by NK cells, lymphocytes T and B cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cells, as well as CD1a and S100 cells, may be due to a combination of lymphoid tissue necrosis and apoptosis and exhaustion of lymphoid proliferation in response to the cytokine overdrive. In addition, the high IL-10 expression associated with its anti-inflammatory action may explain the low degree of inflammation observed in our cases. Taken together, our results suggest that in S-OIV infection, altered innate and adaptative immune responses may lead to incomplete virus eradication in the primary target of the infection and, consequently, imbalance between inflammation and reparation, resulting in bronchiolar obliteration and DAD.
DAD is likely to be a consequence of bronchiolar obstruction and consequent hypoxia rather than direct invasion of the viruses. It is a severe pattern of lung injury and could be secondary to various pulmonary and extrapulmonary insults. 26 In this series of cases we found DAD in which alveolar collapse was prominent, differing from classic DAD found in ARF or secondary to other pulmonary and extrapulmonary insults. This finding may have important implications in the ventilation strategy of the patients. 27 In addition, the presence of intra-alveolar hemorrhage may suggest virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. 23 
The lung tissue score was obtained independently by two different investigators. The pathologic findings were graded according to a five-point semiquantitative severity-based scoring system: 0 = normal lung parenchyma; 1 = changes in 1-25%; 2 = 26-50%; 3 = 51-75%; and 4 = 76-100% of the examined tissue. Table 3 -Semiquantitative analysis of electron microscopy. In our current series, pulmonary ultrastructural analysis was important to obtain an understanding of the pathophysiology of this new disease. First, we demonstrated apoptosis and necrosis in the bronchiolar epithelium together with viral-like particles, thus suggesting the bronchiolar epithelium as the primary target of the virus infection. Second, we documented the submicroscopic pattern of a clastogenic DAD in S-OIV infection. Third, we found indirect evidence of virus infection in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells represented by the TRS and CCC. These submicroscopic structures were demonstrated ultrastructurally in the lung tissue of all the patients and their presence suggests an inactivation of the virus by oseltamivir treatment or an altered innate immune response of these patients. They appeared mainly in respiratory cells and AECs and have previously been described in a variety of cell types. 28, 29 Usually, they occur in endothelial cells and lymphocytes from patients with autoimmune diseases and viral infections. 30 Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome present TRS and CCC in these same cells. 31 The mechanism of TRS and CCC production in vivo is not definitely established. Nevertheless, clinical and experimental studies have shown that the presence of both structures in these diseases is directly associated with the increase of IFNa and IFNb but not with IFNc. 29 One theory to explain the nature and pathogenesis of TRS and CCC suggests that these structures are incomplete viral particles. 30 In our study, these viral-like particles were noted mainly in the respiratory epithelial cells, but not in the other cell types within the lung. These observations reinforce the hypothesis that the primary target cells for S-IOV infection are probably the bronchiolar epithelium. The atypical morphology of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells was probably related to viral cytopathic effects or reactive changes. In fact, the presence of multinucleated epithelial cells is not exclusive to S-IOV, and is seen in pneumonia caused by the family of Paramyxoviridae, including parainfluenza viruses, measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus and, perhaps, metapneumovirus. 31 Although multinucleated cells were seen in our cases, these probably reflect non-specific secondary changes.
We describe a case series of five patients with influenzalike illness with pneumonia and ensuing ARF who underwent OLB with subsequently confirmed diagnosis by RT-PCR testing for S-IOV infections. This report has some limitations. First, this study may not validate the importance of OLB in this population; however, it did provide information about this new disease. Second, it is difficult to compare our findings with those of others because to our knowledge no studies reporting an OLB in patients with S- The lung tissue score was obtained independently by two different investigators. The pathologic findings were graded according to a five-point semiquantitative severity-based scoring system: 0 = normal lung parenchyma; 1 = changes in 1-25%; 2 = 26-50%; 3 = 51-75%; and 4 = 76-100% of the examined tissue. IFN, interferon; TNFa, tumor necrosis factor a. IOV have been published. Although there are already many autopsy series with patients with H1N1 that can be used for comparison, the pathological findings at autopsy are modified mainly by the presence of associated co-infections and mechanical ventilation. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] In summary, we have presented the pulmonary pathology in a confirmed and well-defined series of cases of S-IOV infection associated with ARF. The pathological features, in addition to necrotizing bronchiolitis and DAD, included the presence of multinucleated cells and intra-alveolar fibrin exudates (organizing pneumonia-like lesions). Although each of these features is non-specific, their combined occurrence, together with positive serologic, microbiologic, and immunologic investigations and/or ultrastructural tissue examination enables the diagnosis of S-IOV infection to be confirmed, and is particularly useful in clinically suspicious cases that do not fulfill the WHO criteria or in clinically inapparent cases.
We have shown that viral-like particles can be successfully demonstrated in lung tissue by ultrastructural examination, highlighting the importance of OLB, particularly in those patients without confirmation of the virus. We also showed that bronchioles and epithelium, rather than endothelium, are probably the primary target of infection, and that DAD is the consequence of airways obliteration and dysfunction on innate immunity, suggesting that the treatment should be focused on epithelium repair.",Pathological and ultrastructural analysis of surgical lung biopsies in patients with swine‐origin influenza type A/H1N1 and acute respiratory failure,"Capelozzi, Vera Luiza; Parra, Edwin Roger; Ximenes, Manoel; Bammann, Ricardo Helbert; Barbas, Carmen Silvia Valente; Duarte, Marid Irmd Seixas",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3020331/,188,3180,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,3bed29e225d41a6617ee40c5bc70c0574388079a,"Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have played significant roles in antiviral therapies and are valued for their impressive potency and high barrier to resistance. They have been approved for treatment of herpes simplex virus-1, HIV, HBV, HCV, and influenza, and new drugs are being developed for the treatment of RSV, Ebola, coronavirus MERS, and other emerging viruses. However, this class of compounds has also experienced a high attrition rate in clinical trials due to toxicity. In this review, we discuss the utility of different biochemical and cell-based assays and provide recommendations for assessing toxicity liability before entering animal toxicity studies.","Nucleoside analogs were first studied as antimetabolites in the 1950s by George Hitchings and Gertrude Elion. 1 Their work led to the discovery of treatments for leukemia, gout, hyperuricemia, and parasitic protozoan infection, as well as an immunosuppressant for organ transplant. These efforts paved the way for the discovery of a series of nucleoside analogs as antitumor agents in the 1970s, some of which, such as ara-C and gemcitabine (Figure 1 ), are still in use today. 2, 3 Many of these antitumor nucleoside analogs showed antiviral activity, but none of them possessed an adequate clinical safety profile for antiviral use until Acyclovir (Figure 1 ) was discovered for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, a breakthrough that started a new era in antiviral therapy. 1 Acyclovir's remarkable safety profile stemmed from two properties: (1) activation of the compound to its monophosphate (MP) only occurs in virus-infected cells, since this process relies on a viral thymidine kinase; and (2) acyclovir 5'-triphosphate (TP) selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase over host DNA polymerase a. 4 Follow on generations of HSV nucleoside antivirals (penciclovir and ganciclovir, Figure 1 ) and prodrugs were developed to improve potency and resistance profiles. 5 The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s presented unprecedented demand for effective antivirals.
In 1986, azidothymidine (AZT, zidovudine, Figure 1 ), a chain-terminating inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), was approved, signifying the first step towards control of this devastating disease. The first generation of nucleoside analogs for HIV was efficacious, but these compounds also showed considerable toxicity, including cardiomyopathy (AZT, ddI, and ddC, Figure 1 ), peripheral neuropathy (d4T, ddI, and ddC), sensorineural deafness (ddC), lactic acidosis (AZT, ddI, and d4T), diabetes (ddI), and cytopenia (AZT). 6, 7 The toxicity of ddC and AZT was associated with inhibition of mitochondria DNA synthesis in cell culture [8] [9] [10] and in patient tissue samples. 11 Later on, detailed kinetic studies of HIV nucleosides using recombinant human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol c) demonstrated the importance of selective inhibition of on-target HIV-1 RT over that of the off-target human Pol c. 7, 12 Unfortunately, this knowledge came 10 years too late to inform the 1993 Phase II clinical trial of FIAU in patients infected with HBV, where 7 out of 15 patients developed severe liver toxicity and lactic acidosis, and 5 of these patients died. 13 Followup biochemical, cellular, and in vivo studies showed that FIAU was readily incorporated into mitochondrial DNA, leading to a decrease in mtDNA abundance and thus rendering the mitochondria dysfunctional. 14, 15 The prevalence of mitochondrial toxicity associated with 2 0 -deoxy nucleoside analogs led to the FDA's recommendation to test drug candidates in a set of mitochondrial toxicity assays including Pol c inhibition, lactic acid formation, mitochondrial DNA content, and glucose utilization. 16 With the use of these tests, the second-generation antiviral nucleoside/tide analogs such as 3TC, FTC, and tenofovir were shown to be poor substrates of Pol c and demonstrated significantly improved clinical safety profiles.
Despite our collective knowledge of nucleoside analogassociated mitochondrial toxicity, safety concerns continued in the discovery of HCV antivirals. A number of HCV nucleoside/tide analogs failed in Phase II due to toxicity or association with a toxic analog. These include valopicitabine (NM283, gastrointestinal toxicity, Figure 1 ), 17 balapiravir (R1626, hematologic toxicity, Figure 1 ), 17 BMS-986094 (cardiac and kidney toxicity, Figure 1 ), 18 IDX184 (clinical hold due to association with BMS-986094, Figure 1 ), 19 and PSI-938 (liver toxicity, Figure 1 ). 17 With the exception of PSI-938, the TP forms of these compounds are substrates of mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT). Balapiravir is a specific mitochondria toxin, inhibits POLRMT, reduces mitochondrial protein synthesis, and eventually decreases mitochondrial respiration. 20, 21 Our data showed that 2 0 CMeG-TP is incorporated into RNA by POLRMT, decreases mitochondria protein synthesis, and decreases mitochondrial cellular respiration. 20, 22 Furthermore, Jin et al. demonstrated that the toxicity of BMS-986094 is directly correlated to its 2 0 CMeGMP nucleotide moiety rather than the naphthalene-phosphorylamino propanoate prodrug moiety. 21 Interestingly, when compared to selective mitochondria inhibitors such as ddC, 4-azidoC, and chloramphenicol ( Figure 1 ), the inhibition profile of BMS-986094 is distinctly different for mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiration, indicating it may hit other off-targets such as RNA polymerase I. 20 As of today, the only approved nucleotide prodrug for the treatment of HCV is sofosbuvir ( Figure 1 ), a 2 0 F, 2 0 CMe uridine prodrug that is well tolerated in patients. 23 The TP form of sofosbuvir showed no inhibition of any of the human polymerases tested and is a poor substrate of POLRMT. 20 The relevance of POLRMT inhibition as a marker for nucleotide toxicity has been further supported by works from multiple groups. 20, 21, 22, 24 A clear outlier is PSI-938, a 2 0 F, 2 0 CMe guanosine prodrug, which showed liver toxicity in clinical trials but is a poor substrate of POLMRT and showed no toxicity in any of the in vitro studies conducted so far. 20 Host polymerases have been generally regarded as the primary off-targets for this class of compounds. However, the observed toxicities tend to be highly unpredictable. 7, 25 These may be attributed to complex uptake, distribution, and accumulation of different compound in different organs. For example, three closely related analogs, FIAU, FMAU, and FIAC ( Figure 1 ), showed distinctly different toxicities in animals and human. FIAU showed no toxicity in nonclinical animal species including mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys, but conflicting toxicity findings from two separate studies in woodchucks. 15, 26 In contrast, FIAU-induced hepatotoxicity was observed in clinical trials in week 13 and beyond under potentially much lower exposures than the animal models. 15, 26 In addition, FMAU, a metabolite of FIAU, was tested in a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of murine leukemia. It caused severe neurologic toxicity and two deaths among eight patients after 8-10 days of treatment. Toxicity, primarily hematopoietic, was observed with FIAC, the cytidine analog and known metabolic precursor of FIAU, when used to treat HSV and vesicular stomatitis virus infection. 26 Interestingly, while the more recent HCV nucleotide antivirals, e.g. BMS-986094, PSI-938, and VX-135 (also known as ALS-2200, Figure 1 ) were all liver-targeting nucleotide prodrugs and the administration of PSI-938 and VX-135 resulted in liver toxicity, 27,28 BMS-986094 showed cardiovascular and renal toxicity. 29 It is worthwhile mentioning that antiviral nucleosides could also exert toxicity through disruption of natural NTP pools. AZT only showed modest inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase 7 but is a competitive inhibitor of thymidine kinase 2-catalized phosphorylation of thymidine to TMP. 30 Ribavirin is a poor substrate for mitochondrial RNA polymerase, 22 but it reduces the size of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) pool via inhibition of inosine MP dehydrogenase. 31 As one might expect, there are many possible ways that a nucleoside/tide analog can elicit toxicity that are still beyond our knowledge. In this review, we focus on the host polymerase mechanism-based toxicity and summarize different biochemical and cellular assays to evaluate potential toxicity liabilities, and the strength and limitations of each method.
As most nucleoside/tides analogs need to be transformed into 5'-TP to exert on-target and off-target effects, their TP forms are necessary for elucidating these mechanisms ( Table 1 ). The typical initial enzymatic assay for polymerases is a radioactivity-based polymerization assay, in which the inhibition by nucleotides is measured as an IC 50 value. The inhibition IC 50 assays can be easily adapted to a 96-well filter binding assay, and multiple compounds can be accessed simultaneously. However, based on inhibition studies alone, one cannot establish whether the nucleotide was actually incorporated. Therefore, a single nucleotide incorporation (SNI) assay can be particularly useful to determine if a NTP analog actually served as a substrate for the polymerases. Under a high concentration of NTP analogs (e.g. 500 mM ribose nucleotide TP (rNTP) or 50-100 mM 2 0 -deoxyribose nucleotide TP (dNTP)), the relative rate of incorporation of an analog can be compared to that of its natural NTP counterpart. For further mechanistic insight, a pre-steady state kinetic analysis of the NTP incorporation offers detailed kinetic parameters such as pre-steady state polymerization rate constant k pol and NTP dissociation constant K d . In these studies, incorporation rates are studied using multiple time points and nucleotide concentrations, often using quenchflow techniques, making these studies reagent-and time-consuming. Finally, the mechanism of a nucleotide analog-derived enzyme inhibition can be revealed by an elongation assay, in which a stable elongation complex is formed, and the incorporation of the next few natural NTPs is measured. Normally, an NTP analog can be characterized into one of the three groups: chain-terminators, delayed chain-terminators, or stably incorporated analogs. Stably incorporated NTP analogs are difficult to study for toxicity as they could lead to little or no quantitative changes in DNA, RNA, or protein expression. 36 The quality of the above-mentioned biochemical assays relies heavily on the availability of high quality TP active forms, which can be time-and resourceconsuming to synthesize, and the TP salts are subject to degradation overtime. At times, certain inorganic contaminants could lead to apparent inhibition of polymerases.
Due to their mechanism of action, nucleoside analogs are generally evaluated for 5-8 days in both replicating laboratory-adapted cell lines and non-replicating primary cells. 18 A standard readout is the effect of compound on the ATP level within the cells. We found that among 20þ laboratory-adapted cells we tested, prostate cancerderived PC-3 cells and T-cell leukemia-derived MT4 cells are generally the most sensitive to toxins, and are significantly more sensitive than HepG2 cells, a widely used cell line for in vitro toxicity studies. In addition, we found that laboratory-adapted cells are as useful for detecting potential toxicity liabilities as primary cells.
In certain cases, testing in a specific cell assay is warranted. For example, a number of the first-generation HIV nucleoside analogs showed myelosuppressive effects. As a result, the FDA recommended evaluating this toxicity on the growth of human bone marrow progenitor cells in colony formation assays. 37 The importance of measuring cellular TP levels A nucleoside/tide analog's cytotoxicity is often directly related to its cellular level of the active TP metabolite. BMS-986094 and IDX184 are both 2 0 CMe guanosine nucleotide prodrugs, but the former formed >37-fold higher TP, and this correlated with its significantly higher toxicity. 18 Some nucleoside analogs are poorly phosphorylated in cells, such as balapiravir. Even though it is a specific inhibitor of POLRMT, balapiravir showed little or no toxicity in a large panel of cell lines and primary cells tested, but development of this compound was stopped at Phase II due to toxicity.
As shown in Table 1 , we employed three mitochondriafocused cell-based assays to evaluate potential mitochondrial toxicity. The mitochondrial DNA content assay has been widely used to study 2 0 -deoxy nucleoside analogs, but it does not assess the effect of ribose nucleoside/tide analogs on mitochrondrial RNA synthesis. 20,29 ddC serves as a good positive control and HepG2 cells seem to be an ideal cell line for this assay. The mitochondrial protein synthesis assay has been useful to evaluate ribonucleoside/tide analogs. In this assay, the levels of two proteins are measured simultaneously: the mitochondrial DNA-encoded protein cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COX-1) and a nuclear DNA-encoded protein succinate dehydrogenase A (SDH-A). 32 For data analysis, we found that comparing the individual levels of the COX-1 and SDH-A proteins to the untreated DMSO control yielded more reproducible data than using the ratio of COX-1:SDH-A. Chloramphenicol, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis, is used as the positive control.
Since the 1950s, mitochondrial respiration has been regarded as the ""gold standard"" for the measurement of mitochondrial function. 38 It has been used extensively to study mitochondrial toxins that directly impair the electron transport chain but has not been used to study the nucleoside/tide analogs until recently. [39] [40] [41] [42] This assay provides a sensitive functional readout and does not require knowledge of the mechanism of action. 20 A complete loss of mitochondrial respiration capacity can be detected before any change in the cellular ATP level, and this phenomenon has been observed for inhibitors with diverse molecular targets including ddC (inhibitor of mitochondrial DNA synthesis), 4 0 -azido cytidine (inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA synthesis), and chloramphenicol (inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis). For compounds that show both mitochondrial and general toxicity (such as BMS-986094), this method makes it possible to identify whether mitochondria toxicity occurs at a lower drug concentration. 20 For both mitochondrial protein and respiration assays, we found that PC-3 cells offer higher sensitivity and reproducibility than HepG2 cells. 20 An assay with limited predictive value: The glucose-galactose CC 50 assay When faced with mitochondria damage, cells are known to switch to glycolysis to generate ATP; therefore the glucose-galactose CC 50 assay has been widely used to detect mitochondria toxicity. 43 In the absence of glucose, the galactose-adapted cells are forced to rely heavily on mitochondrial OXPHOS and thus would show a !3-fold decrease in CC 50 . 44 However, the predictivity of this assay was challenged by Hyne's 2013 report showing that this assay only detected 2-5% of the 200 potential mitochondrial toxins tested. 44, 45 Even though no nucleoside/tide analogs were included in Hyne's study, it is consistent with our finding from testing >30 clinically relevant nucleoside/tide analogs. None of the known mitochondrial toxins such as ddC, FIAU, or 4 0 -azido C showed enhanced cytotoxicity in galactose-adapted cells.
Research and development of a significant number of nucleoside/tide analogs were terminated in the preclinical stage due to toxicity in the animal models; though only a few were reported 24,46,47 and mitochondrial toxicity was indicated or suspected. To date, due to a number of factors outlined above, mitochondrial toxicity has been difficult to detect in animal species and correlation to humans is at best tenuous. 48 Potentially, animal models with genetic mitochondrial abnormalities or humanized animals may be more sensitive to nucleoside/tide toxicity. For example, mice models with genetic mitochondrial abnormalities such as heterozygous superoxide dismutase 2 knockout (Sod þ/À ) mice were more susceptible to mitochondria toxins than the wild-type animals. 49 Recently, Xu et al. reported FIAU-induced liver toxicity in chimeric TK-NOG mice grafted with humanized livers. 50 Animal models like these may improve our ability to detect nucleoside toxicity.
As viral diseases vary greatly in duration and severity, the safety threshold of an antiviral nucleoside/tide needs to be considered in the context of its efficacy and treatment duration. For example, compounds to treat acute and deadly viral infections such as Ebola would likely have different safety criteria than drugs used to control chronic infections such as HIV-1 and HBV. Existing nucleoside/tides are routinely screened against emerging viruses, and it is possible that a compound that failed to achieve an adequate therapeutic window against one virus may be suitable for treating other viral infections.
Anti-viral nucleoside/tide analogs target the viral DNA and RNA replication machinery, and this mechanism makes them potential inhibitors of host DNA and RNA synthesis as well, especially mitochondrial DNA and RNA synthesis. Mitochondrial toxicity manifests in multiple forms in vivo and underlies many clinical-stage failures and has been difficult to detect in animal studies. Over the past 30 years, a battery of in vitro tests for mitochondrial toxicity has evolved and continues to expand, allowing for improved early detection of mitochondrial liability. As for any drug molecule, the actual toxicity liability cannot be assessed fully until tested in animal toxicity studies and eventually in human clinical trials. Nevertheless, we believe that employing the proper biochemical and cellular assays early on will have a meaningful impact on reducing pre-clinical and clinical toxicity liability for this class of compounds.",Addressing the selectivity and toxicity of antiviral nucleosides,"Feng, Joy Y",Antivir Chem Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5890540/,99,2617,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,43fb44b6c809c497fa4e6e7a52e7a3dbbebe4155,This study aimed to describe real-life microbiological testing of adults hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and to assess concordance with the,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalisation worldwide. Mortality rates for patients hospitalised with CAP approach 30%, especially in those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Diagnostic testing in CAP has the potential to improve individual patient management, reducing the risk of clinical failure and death, and to generate epidemiological data, informing the selection of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. Unfortunately, these advantages are counterbalanced by high healthcare costs associated with diagnostic testing and low sensitivity of these tests to identify pathogens causing CAP [5, 6] .
Considering both the benefits and limitations of diagnostic testing, several international scientific societies have published guidelines on effective diagnostic testing strategies for hospitalised patients with CAP. However, important differences exist between recommendations of different societies [7] . These recommendations are mainly based on expert opinion given the scarcity of published evidence. In particular, substantial differences can be found between the two most cited international guidelines on CAP: the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the 2011 European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines [8, 9] . Limited data are available of real-life diagnostic testing practices for hospitalised patients with CAP and whether real-life diagnostic testing practices are concordant with the 2007 IDSA/ATS and 2011 ERS guideline recommendations [10] [11] [12] .
This study aimed to describe real-life microbiological testing of adults hospitalised with CAP, evaluate the influence of geography and disease severity on microbiological testing practices, and assess the concordance of real-life microbiological testing with the two most cited international guidelines, specifically the 2007 IDSA/ATS and the 2011 ERS guidelines.
We performed a secondary analysis of an international, multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study using the Global Initiative for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia (GLIMP) database [13] . GLIMP was conducted among 222 hospitals in 54 countries over 4 days, with 1 day per month randomly selected during March, April, May and June 2015. All adult patients (aged >18 years) hospitalised for CAP at the participating centres during the four study days were screened by GLIMP investigators and included in this secondary analysis. Patients hospitalised with a diagnosis of hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia were excluded. The GLIMP coordinating centre was located at the University of Texas Health San Antonio (San Antonio, TX, USA). The coordinating centre received expedited project approval by the institutional review board (number HSC20150184E). The review board waived the need for receipt of informed consent due to the nature of the study. Institutional review board approval was obtained by the site investigators at each individual centre. A detailed description of the GLIMP organisation and methodologies has been previously published [13] .
The primary outcome of this study was describing real-life microbiological testing among patients hospitalised with CAP, including the frequency of testing, laboratory technique used and patients' characteristics by testing status (tested patients versus not tested patients). This study had also two secondary outcomes. The first was to evaluate the influence of geography and disease severity on testing practices. ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and combined administration of vasopressors and invasive mechanical ventilation were used as measures of disease severity. The second was to evaluate the concordance of real-life microbiological testing with the 2007 IDSA/ATS and the 2011 ERS guidelines for CAP.
CAP was defined by evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates on thoracic imaging (chest radiograph, computed tomography or ultrasound) during the first 48 h of hospitalisation and at least one of the following criteria: new or increased cough with or without sputum production or with purulent respiratory secretions; fever or hypothermia (documented rectal or oral temperature ⩾37.8°C or <36°C, respectively); and evidence of systemic inflammation, such as abnormal white blood cell count (leukocytosis (>10 000 cells·mL −1 ), leukopenia (<4000 cells·mL −1 ) or bandaemia (>10%)) and increased C-reactive protein or procalcitonin concentrations above the local upper limit of normal. Hospitalisation was defined as admission at an inpatient service and subsequent stay for ⩾24 h. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was defined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, in which the minimum inhibitory concentration was ⩾4 µg·mL −1 to oxacillin. Production of extended-spectrum β-lactamase was defined according to the CLSI guidelines via broth microdilution or disk diffusion clavulanate inhibition test.
Diagnostic testing was defined as concordant with the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines if recommended tests were performed and non-recommended tests were not performed. Similarly, diagnostic testing was defined as concordant with the 2011 ERS guidelines if recommended tests were performed and non-recommended tests were not performed. The tests considered in this study as recommended or non-recommended by the IDSA/ATS and ERS guidelines are presented in table 1. Over-testing was defined as a condition where tests not required were performed. Under-testing was defined as a condition where required tests were not performed.
Continuous variables were presented as medians with interquartile range. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages of the specified group. Comparisons between groups were made with the Fisher exact test or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. A two-sided p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics, version 24, software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Among 3702 patients, 3217 (86.9%) had at least one diagnostic test performed, with 1173 (36.5%) patients with at least one pathogen detected by diagnostic testing. Variables significantly associated with the performance of diagnostic testing are presented in table 2. When patients from whom at least one pathogen was detected were compared with patients from whom no pathogens were detected, we found the former group more commonly presented the following conditions: bronchiectasis, tracheostomy, at least one respiratory comorbidity, hypertension, HIV infection, pervious infections, previous healthcare exposure, severe CAP, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and use of vasopressors (table 2) . Oceania, and in 1.3% of patients admitted to African hospitals ( p<0.01). Pneumococcal and Legionella urinary antigen tests were performed in >40% of the patients admitted in European hospitals and in <20% of the patients hospitalised in the remaining continents ( p<0.01). Acute-phase serology for Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella species was more common in Europe (11.2%) than elsewhere (4.6%) ( p<0.01). Diagnostic testing was concordant with the IDSA/ATS and ERS recommendations in 16.7% and 23.9% of the patients, respectively. When the overall study population was analysed, over-testing and under-testing were reported in 59.3% and 19.1% of the IDSA/ATS-discordant patients, respectively (figure 1). Among IDSA/ATS-discordant patients, blood cultures performed without indications accounted for the majority of over-testing, while the lack of pneumococcal urinary antigen test was responsible for a significant percentage of under-testing. Over-testing and under-testing were documented in 29.3% and in 42.0% of the ERS-discordant patients, respectively (figure 1). Among ERS-discordant patients, pneumococcal and Legionella urinary antigen tests performed without an indication accounted for the majority of over-testing, while under-testing was mainly due to the lack of obtaining blood cultures when indicated. IDSA/ATS concordance was more common in Europe than in North America (21.5% versus 9.8%; p<0.01), while ERS concordance was more common in North America than in Europe (33.5% versus 19.5%; p<0.01).
This international, multicentre, point-prevalence study provides a high-quality, real-life picture of diagnostic testing in patients hospitalised with CAP. At least one microbiological test was performed in the vast majority of patients hospitalised with CAP and led to an aetiological diagnosis in one-third of patients tested. Geographic area and disease severity influenced testing frequency. Our study also highlights a significant discordance of real-life diagnostic testing compared to recommended testing in the 2007 IDSA/ ATS and 2011 ERS guidelines for CAP management in adults. Several crucial points could be raised by our findings.
First, a pathogen was identified in one-third of adult inpatients with CAP. This pathogen-detection yield is similar to previously reported investigations [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and consistent with the EPIC (Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community) study [1] . Despite extensive laboratory testing, the EPIC study identified a pathogen in 38% of 2259 patients hospitalised with CAP in the USA. The low pathogen-detection yield reported in this and other CAP studies highlights how limited our understanding is of CAP aetiologies among adult inpatients and how current empirical antimicrobial recommendations are based on weak evidence. Studies aimed at collecting as much data as possible to identify the aetiology using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques and innovative pathogen-discovery approaches are urgently needed. Furthermore, aetiological studies should use novel analytical techniques in order to incorporate evidence from multiple specimens to account for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests used [22] . Once a more accurate estimate of the aetiological distribution of CAP among adult inpatients is available, empirical antimicrobial recommendations should be updated.
Secondly, our study showed the existence of a strong association between pneumonia severity and performance of diagnostic testing, in accordance with IDSA/ATS and ERS recommendations. As a consequence, pneumonia severity was also associated with an increased probability of pathogen detection. Exploring the true determinants of pathogen detection would have required a systematic and universal testing strategy and, for this reason, it was out of the scope of this study.
Thirdly, our study confirmed the differing diagnostic yield of various diagnostic tests. Specifically, only 6.7% of blood cultures yielded a positive result, confirming the low sensitivity of blood cultures for revealing the aetiology of CAP, similar to the findings of other studies [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . In contrast, BAL cultures were characterised by a high diagnostic yield (38.8%). While impractical and potentially associated with complications, BAL cultures represent an effective diagnostic tool for patients with severe infections, who may benefit the most from a targeted antimicrobial regimen. Indeed, a randomised trial by VAN DER EERDEN et al. [24] showed a statistically significant difference in mortality among ICU patients receiving empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobials (91%) versus patients receiving pathogen-directed antimicrobials (45%). Fourthly, our analysis described a significant geographic variation in diagnostic testing strategies. We could speculate that the economical restraints of African health systems accounted for the reduced number of blood cultures and viral tests performed in this setting. Laboratory infrastructure to support diagnostic microbiological testing is limited in most African countries: bacteriological culture or molecular techniques that form the mainstay of CAP diagnostics in well-resourced settings are often lacking in Africa [25, 26] . In contrast, the seasonality and the epidemiological relevance of respiratory viruses, such as avian-origin influenza A and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, may have favoured the performance of viral testing in Asia [27, 28] .
Fifthly, our study is among the first to evaluate the concordance of real-life diagnostic testing with international guidelines. To the best of our knowledge, only JENKINS et al. [12] made a similar attempt. They analysed the concordance of diagnostic testing practices retrospectively in a cohort of adult inpatients with CAP with the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines and reported over-testing with blood cultures. Our study revealed that real-life diagnostic testing was not concordant with IDSA/ATS or ERS guidelines in the vast majority of the patients. Specifically, the discordance with the IDSA/ATS guidelines was mainly due to over-testing. This situation may be explained by the restrictive testing recommended by the IDSA/ATS guidelines. Of note, under-testing was also a cause of discordance with the IDSA/ATS guidelines and was more frequently encountered in North America than in Europe. Discordance with ERS guidelines was mainly due to under-testing, as a result of the extensive testing approach recommended by these guidelines. Over-testing was also identified as a cause of discordance with the ERS guidelines. This event was more frequently reported in Europe than in North America. We were intrigued by European clinicians' extensive ordering of diagnostic tests, even beyond what is recommended by the ERS guidelines. Insurance and healthcare system-related factors may have shaped the diagnostic approach both of European and North American clinicians. Nonetheless, the significant discrepancies between real-life diagnostic testing and IDSA/ATS/ERS recommended testing is worrisome and further studies aimed at assessing the clinical and economic implications of the testing approach proposed by the IDSA/ATS guidelines, the testing approach proposed by the ERS guidelines, and real-life diagnostic testing are needed.
Finally, this study has important strengths and limitations. To our knowledge, GLIMP is the first study to enrol a large and diverse group of adult patients hospitalised with CAP across six continents, providing a detailed, real-world picture of CAP diagnostic testing around the world. Our ability to assess the concordance of real-life diagnostic testing with IDSA/ATS and ERS guideline recommendations was affected by the lack of information about recent travel, failure of outpatient antibiotic therapy, presence of cavitary infiltrates, lymphopenia, and feasibility of sputum collection in the GLIMP database. Similarly, incomplete data regarding presence of pleural effusions and clinical and epidemiological determinants of Legionella infection limited the accuracy our findings, probably leading to an inflation of our over-testing estimates. Finally, due to its cross-sectional design, our study did not provide CAP outcome data.
In conclusion, our understanding of the aetiologies of CAP among hospitalised adults is scarce, limiting the accuracy of empirical antimicrobial regimens. Disease severity and geography are associated with differences in testing approaches. The wide discordance between IDSA/ATS/ERS recommendations and real-life testing strategies should prompt future studies to evaluate the clinical and economic implications of different testing approaches and investigate the reasons for these differences.",Microbiological testing of adults hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia: an international study,"Carugati, Manuela; Aliberti, Stefano; Reyes, Luis Felipe; Franco Sadud, Ricardo; Irfan, Muhammad; Prat, Cristina; Soni, Nilam J.; Faverio, Paola; Gori, Andrea; Blasi, Francesco; Restrepo, Marcos I.",ERJ Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6174282/,21,2195,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,11ebffa99e4b093c6304549246b534983012f909,"Purpose: Human adenovirus infection mimics Kawasaki disease (KD) but can be detected in KD patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical differences between KD with adenovirus infection and only adenoviral infection and to identify biomarkers for prediction of adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection. Methods: A total of 147 patients with isolated adenovirus were identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 11 patients having KD with adenovirus, who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy during the acute phase of KD were also evaluated. Results: Compared with the adenoviral infection group, the KD with adenovirus group was significantly associated with frequent lip and tongue changes, skin rash and changes in the extremities. In the laboratory parameters, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level and presence of hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria were significantly associated with the KD group. In the multivariate analysis, lip and tongue changes (odds ratio [OR], 1.416; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.151-1.741; P=0.001), high CRP level (OR, 1.039; 95% CI 1.743-1.454; P= 0.021) and sterile pyuria (OR 1.052; 95% CI 0.861-1.286; P=0.041) were the significant predictive factors of KD. In addition, the cutoff CRP level related to KD with adenoviral detection was 56 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 75.9%. Conclusion: Lip and tongue changes, higher serum CRP level and sterile pyuria were significantly correlated with adenovirus-positive KD.","Various studies have been carried out to find out the etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD). Viral infection is thought to be one of the causes of KD, but it is still controversial [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although several potential viral causes of KD are identified, the diagnosis of KD with concomitant viral infection is a little unclear to confirm KD. Adenoviral infection is frequently involved in young children less than 3 years and is characterized with prolonged high fever, upper and lower respiratory tract symptom, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptom with hepatic involvement. Inflammatory biomarker such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are mostly ele vated in patients with adenoviral infection. Because of strong inflammatory response, adeno viral infection closely resembles bacterial infection and KD [5] [6] [7] [8] . Although the majority patients of adenoviral infection presented respiratory condition, extrapulmonary manifestation of conjunctivitis, skin rash, mucous membrane changes, cervical lymphadenopathy and encephalitis can be associated. The various clinical manifestation of adenovirus infections are particularly similar to KD regarding the clinical aspects [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .
A recent study demonstrated the distinction of clinical and virologic characteristics of adenoviral infection differentiating from KD with incidental adenoviral detection 14) . Because of clinical similarities, early and acute diagnosis and intravenous immunoglo bulin (IVIG) therapy are essential to prevent coronary artery abnormalities in KD. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of KD patients with adenovirus detection and those with only adenoviral infection and to identify biomarkers that can differentiate KD from adenovirus infections at the initial hospitalization stage. In addition, we also assessed the clinical and laboratory distinction of KD with adenovirus from KD without adenovirus infection.
We conducted a retrospective study from August 2012 to June 2016. A total of 129 patients with KD were diagnosed during this period. The diagnosis of KD was established in patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of KD. Typical KD was diagnosed in the presence of fever for at least 5 days combined with at least 4 of the 5 following clinical features; the lip and tongue change, bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis, skin rash, erythema and edema of the hands and feet and cervical lymphadenopathy with diameter of ≥1.5 cm. Incomplete KD was diagnosed if the patients had symptoms that were associated with KD met the inflammatory biomarker criteria 15) .
Among 129 KD patients, respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction was performed in 107 patients. Respiratory virus panel included influenza A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, bocavirus types 1 through 4, coronavirus NL 63, OC 43, and 229E, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus types A, B, and C.
In addition, we retrospectively analyzed 147 patients with isolated adenoviral infection. The most common symptoms were fever more than 4 days (81.3%), cough (73.2%), sputum (68.8%), rhino rrhea (65.2%). The most common diagnosis at admission was acute pharyn gotonsillitis (57.3%), followed by pneumonia (16.1%), bronchiolitis (12.5%), and gastroenteritis (5.9%). The pharyngoconjunctival fever was initially diagnosed in 12 patients (8.2%).
We compared 147 patients with adenoviral infection and 11 pa ti ents with KD with adenovirus detection. In addition, we also com pared 11 patients with KD with adenovirus and 87 KD without ade novirus detection. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital (KANGDONG 2018-01-004). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
All patients with KD were examined for inflammatory markers such as total white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil/ lymphocyte ratio, ESR, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LD), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).
In addition, other laboratory findings such as hemoglobin, serum sodium, serum albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and urinalysis were also assessed. However, BNP was not detected in most patients with isolated adenoviral infection.
Regarding the criteria of typical KD 15) , the acute clinical features such as conjunctival injection, lip and tongue changes, skin rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, and changes in extremities were also evaluated.
All of the KD patients were initially treated with IVIG (2 g/kg) for 12 hours and additionally treated with IVIG in case of IVIG resistance. IVIG resistance was defined as a persistent or recrude scent fever for >48 hours after initial IVIG completion. In the case of recurrent or persistent fever with twice IVIG therapy, we managed with the fever with methylprednisolon pulse therapy or infliximab. After the acute phase, all patients have been given low dose aspirin for 8 weeks. Low dose aspirin was discontinued unless the coronary artery abnormalities persisted.
In all patients with KD, transthoracic echocardiography was performed to define the involvement of the coronary arteries during the acute phase and also at an outpatient clinic at 2-3 weeks and 8 weeks. The coronary abnormalities analysis by echocardiography was performed off-line retrospectively. Echocardiographic recording at 3 different times was reviewed in each patient. Measurement were conducted at the left main coronary artery, the left anterior de scending artery and the right coronary artery. To identify the coronary abnormalities, we assessed the z value of coronary arteries according to the body surface area. We defined the coronary abnormalities as a coronary z score of more than 2.5, the presence of wall irregularity, no acute tapering of the coronary artery branch and saccular or diffuse coronary aneurysm 15) .
Continuous variables were expressed as the median (interquartile range) and categorical variables as either a number or a percentage. For continuous variables, the comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test, or chi-square analysis, as appropriate. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect the independent variables as sociated with KD with adenoviral detection using all parameters with a P value<0.05 via univariate analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the discrimination of KD with adenoviral detection from isolated Korean J Pediatr 2018;61(2):43-48 adenoviral infection and then to derive sensitivity and specificity values for CRP. The cutoff value of CRP parametric variable was determined by ROC curve. A P-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Various kinds of virus were detected in 42 out of 107 (39.2%) patients in KD. Fig. 1 showed the virus distribution of KD in virus positive patients. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected (40.5%). Additionally, 12 adenoviruses were identified in KD. Two patients had coinfection: RSV type B and rhinovirus in 1 patient and adenovirus and coronavirus in 1 patient. We excluded 1 adenovirus patient with co-infection of coronavirus.
Among 129 patients with KD, adenovirus without coinfection was identified in 11 patients. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of KD with adenoviral detection are shown in Table 1 . The median age of these patients was 36 months (range, 5-109 months). Nine patients (81.8%) were diagnosed as typical KD. Most of the KD patients had 4 or more clinical symptoms satisfying the KD criteria, and 2 incomplete KD patients had 3 clinical features of KD accompanied by coronary artery abnormalities. In the laboratory findings, CRP was more than 50 mg/L as a whole. BNP was found to be higher than 100 pg/mL in only 3 patients. AST/ALT elevation more than 45 IU/L was detected in 3 patients and sterile pyuria defined as ≥10 WBC/ high-power field was shown in 6 patients. Four patients had developed coronary artery abnormalities.
We compared 11 patients with KD with adenovirus and 147 patients with isolated adenoviral infection. Table 2 showed the comparison of clinical and laboratory variables between the 2 groups. In patients with KD with adenovirus detection, the median fever dura tion was 6 days and was not different from isolated adenoviral infec tion group (P=0.356). Regarding the clinical features of KD, lip and tongue changes and skin rash and changes in extremities were more frequently demonstrated in the KD with adenoviral detection group than the adenoviral infection group (81.8% vs. 15.6%, P< 0.001 in lip and tongue changes; 72.7% vs. 36.7%, P=0.007 in skin rash; 63.6% vs. 10.2%, P=0.001 in changes in extremities). We also compared the differences in laboratory parameters between the 2 groups. There were significant differences in CRP (67. 5 Table 3 ).
The cutoff value of CRP that differentiated adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection was 56 mg/L, which resulted in a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 75.9% (Fig. 2 ). In a total of 129 patients with KD, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with KD who were adenovirus positive (n=11) were compared with those who were adenovirus-negative (n=87). We excluded the patients with other virus isolation (n=31) in the adenovirus-negative group. The age, sex, and fever duration did not differ between patient groups. Fourteen patients (16.1%) in the adenovirus-negative KD group were diagnosed with incomplete KD compared with 2 patients (22.2%) in the adenovirus-positive KD group. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical manifestation of KD and laboratory parameters between the two groups. In addition, coronary artery complications were not different between the 2 groups (36.4% [4 of 11] vs. 33.3% [29 of 87], P=0.868). 
Our findings demonstrate that lip and tongue changes, higher serum CRP level and sterile pyuria were significantly related to the adenovirus-positive KD differentiating from isolated adenoviral infection. The cutoff CRP level was 56 mg/L, with 81.8% sensitivity and 75.9% specificity. The development of coronary artery abnormalities was not different between the adenovirus positive group and adenovirus negative group in KD patients.
This study demonstrated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of KD with incidental adenoviral detection that may help differentiate isolated adenoviral infection. Although the clinical features of adenovirus-positive KD are similar to an isolated adenoviral infection, adenoviral-positive KD usually had frequent lip and tongue change, skin rash and changes in extremities compared to adenoviral infection. However, cervical lymphadenopathy was not differently observed between the 2 groups. In the present study, CRP, hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria could be differentiated between the adenovirus-positive KD group and adenoviral infection group. In addition, the cutoff CRP level of 56 mg/L aids in the discrimination of diagnosis of KD from adenoviral infection. This distinct clinical and laboratory pattern was characteristic of adenovirus positive KD. However, high CRP level could also be observed in adenoviral infection with secondary bacterial infection. Although the American Heart Association guidelines suggest that a CRP ≥30 mg/L or ESR ≥40 mm/hr may consider incomplete KD 15) , a recent study demonstrated that a CRP ≥30 mg/L has a lack specificity for KD. Additionally, a higher CRP ≥70 mg/L suggesting the discrimination of KD from adenoviral infection was consistently observed in the KD group 14) .
Previous studies investigated viral etiology in KD and the role of viral infection associated with KD. Several potential viruses including rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus were detected in KD patients [1] [2] [3] [4] . In contrast, no association of coronavirus and bocavirus with KD was demonstrated in the other study 16) .
Although the relationship between virus and KD was not precisely identified, clinical presentation of adenovirus still mimics KD [9] [10] [11] [12] . It remains to be determined whether this virus causes KD with triggering pathophysiology, leading to similar clinical features as adenoviral infection. This study has several important clinical im plications. The early differential diagnosis of KD from adenoviral infection was important to prevent inadvertent coronary artery complications. The suggested clinical features and inflammatory markers could be useful in differentiating KD from isolated adeno viral infection in the early period of disease. In addition, other inflammatory markers such as BNP and procalcitonin should be assessed, because no specific inflammatory biomarker was establish ed during the acute phase.
However, there were no significant differences in clinical and laboratory findings between the adenovirus-positive and adenovirusnegative KD groups. The development of coronary artery abnormalities was also not different. Therefore, the adenovirus detection could not be excluded in KD, but might not affect the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of virus associated KD and detection of specific biomarkers of KD are crucial to diagnose and treat without untoward coronary complications.
Although we found clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters differentiating adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adeno viral infection, no specific adenoviral type was identified in 11 pati ents with adenovirus-positive KD. In addition, there was no relationship between adenoviral detection and coronary artery abnormality in KD.
In the study, we did not routinely examine for BNP in the adenoviral infection, so we could not assess the difference between the 2 groups.
This was a retrospective study and we evaluated a relatively small number of adenovirus-positive KD patients; further prospective studies with larger numbers of patients are warranted to confirm our results.
Despite the similarities between KD and adenoviral infection, clinical and laboratory features can be used to differentiate KD with incidental adenoviral detection from adenoviral infection. Serum CRP can be used as a biomarker to predict KD from isolated adenoviral infection at the early stage of hospitalization.",Discrimination of Kawasaki disease with concomitant adenoviral detection differentiating from isolated adenoviral infection,"Kim, Jong Han; Kang, Hye Ree; Kim, Su Yeong; Ban, Ji-Eun",Korean J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5854841/,226,2163,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,6755e8b9e6792097d1be5bdf0041c3df1980ec60,"The Golgi complex is composed of at least four distinct compartments, termed the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi cisternae and the trans-Golgi network","(TGN). It has recently been reported that the organization of the Golgi complex is disrupted in cells treated with the fungal metabolite, brefeldin-A. Under these conditions, it was shown that resident enzymes of the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi return to the ER. We report here that 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors, when pulse-labeled within the ER of brefeldin-Atreated cells, acquired numerous N-linked galactose residues with a half time of approximately 2 h, as measured by their ability to bind to RCA-I lectin affinity columns. In contrast, Limax flavus lectin chromatography revealed that <10% of these receptors acquired sialic acid after 8 h in brefeldin-A. Two lines of evidence suggested that proteins within and beyond the TGN did not return to the ER in the presence of brefeldin-A. First, the majority of 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors present in the TGN and endosomes did not return to the ER after up to 6 h in brefeldin-A, as determined by their failure to contact galactosyltransferase that had relocated there. Moreover, although marmose 6-phosphate receptors did not acquire sialic acid when present in the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, they were readily sialylated when labeled at the cell surface and transported to the TGN. These experiments indicate that galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme, returns to the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of brefeldin-A, while the bulk of sialyltransferase, a resident of the TGN, does not. Our findings support the proposal that the TGN is a distinct, fourth compartment of the Golgi apparatus that is insensitive to brefeldin-A.
IOCHEMICAL fractionation experiments and the immunocytochemical localization of specific glycosyltransferases and their products have led to the notion that the Golgi complex is divided into at least three distinct subcomparmaents (11, 21, 23, 27) . The first compartment, termed the cis-Golgi, is thought to house N-acetylglucosamine (Glc-NAc)t-l-phosphodiester ot-N-acetylglucosaminidase (18) , an enzyme involved in the construction of mannose 6-phosphate (man6P) residues on lysosomal enzyme oligosaccharide side chains. The medial Golgi houses GlcNAc transferase I (12) , and galactosyltransferase is located predominantly in trans-Golgi cisternae (37) . Since proteins pass through the Golgi by a series of vesicular transfers (39) from the cisto the medial to the trans-Golgi (3, 42) , the assembly of N-linked oligosaccharide chains is regulated by the order in which proteins gain access to particular mannosidases and glycosyltransferases (27) . Beyond oligosaccharide assembly, the significance of Golgi compartmentation is not fully understood. phate receptors, when pulse-labeled in the ER of BFAtreated cells, readily acquired N-linked galactose, yet only rarely acquired sialic acid residues. We show here that the failure of proteins to acquire sialic acid is most likely due to a failure of sialyltransferase to relocate to the ER, rather than an inability of the enzyme to act within the ER. Our results indicate that unlike the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi cisternae, the TGN is insensitive to BFA action.
Brefeldin-A was either the generous gift of Dr. R. Klausner (National Institutes of Health) or purchased from Epicenter Bioteclmolngy (Madison, WI). RCA-I agarose, 3-[(3-cholamidopmpyl)dimethylammonio]-l-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), galactosyltransferase, ~-galactosidase, and deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Pentamannosyl phospbate-Sepharose and L/maxflovus slug lectin-Aifigel were prepared as described (17, 34) .
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) clone 13, clone 15B, and clone 1021 cells were originally obtained from Dr. S. Kornfeld by Dr. J. Rothman, who provided them to our laboratory. CHO clone 13 cells cannot translocate UDP-galactose into the Golgi and display an apparent defect in galactosyltransferase (6); CHO 15B cells lack GlcNAc transferase I activity (20) ; clone 1021 cells lack CMP-sialic acid translocase activity, and thus cannot add sialic acid to oligosaccbaride chains (6, 8) . CHO clone 15B and clone 1021 cell lines were grown as monolayers in c~MEM containing 7.5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. CHO wild-type and clone 13 cells were grown in suspension culture in the same media.
Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine (Translabel; Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) at 0.1 mCi/ml in aMEM lacking cysteine and methionine but containing 10% dialyzed FCS. Chase periods were initiated by washing cells twice in TD (25 mM ""Iris C1, pH 7.4, 5.4 mM KC1, 137 mM NaC1, 0.3 mM NazHPO4), followed by addition of complete media. After the times indicated, cells were washed once in ice-cold TD and lysed with 1.0 ml RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris HCI pH 7.2, 0.15 M NaCI, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxyeholate, 0,1% SDS, and 0.1% gelatin). Lysates were centrifuged at 330000 g for 10 rain in a centrifuge (model TL-100; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Suspension cells were labeled at a density of ~2 x l(P/ml.
300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors were isolated from cell extracts by pentamannosyl-phosphate Sepharose chromatography (34) . Receptors isolated from the equivalent of ,,~125 t~g cell extract were then incubated with 100/~1 RCA-I agarose in a total volume of I ml, 50 mM Hells pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCI, 0.5% CHAPS, 5 mM ~-glycerophosphate for 30 min at room temllrature. The slurry was poured into a column, washed with 3 ml of the same buffer (except that it contained 0.05% Triton X-100 instead of CHAPS), and ehited with 1 ml of the former buffer containing 0.1 M galactose. Slug lectin chromatography was carried out according to Goda and Pfeffer (17) . Samples were then precipitated in TCA, electrophoresed in 6% SDS polyacrylamide gels, dried, and autoradiographed as previously described (34) .
CHO clone 1021 cells were metabolically labeled for 60 min in the presence of 10 ttg/rnl BFA and then chased for 4 h in the presence or absence of 100 ~tg/ml cycloheximide, shown previously to block protein synthesis by 98 % (34) . Samples were then analyzed as described in Fig. I and above.
Cell surface man6P receptor oligosaccharides were labeled with UDP-[3H]Gal (Amersham Corp.) and galactosyltransferase according to Duncan and Kornfeld (10) . Cells were then incubated at 37°C (in 100 ml suspension culture) for 0 or 6 h in the presence or absence of 10 ttg/rnl BFA. Man6P receptors were isolated by pentamannosyl phospbate-Sepharose chromatography (34) . Purified receptors were digested with pmnase (CalBiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA), and the resulting glycollptides were subjected to jack bean/5-galactosidase digestion and Sephadex (}-25 chromatography to assess sialic acid acquisition (10).
Protein was determined according to the method of Bradford (5) using BSA as standard. Autoradiograms were quantified using a densitometer (model 300A; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Neuraminidase treatment of man6P receptors was carried out using Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase as described (17) .
If cells are treated with 10/~g/ml BFA, proteins within the ER acquire endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharides (9, 28) . Since resistance to endoglycosidase H reflects the concerted action of the medial Golgi enzymes, GlcNAc transferase I and Golgi mannosidase II (27) , these data suggest that resident enzymes of the medial Golgi return to the ER upon BFA treatment. Indeed, the redistribution of mannosidase II has been shown directly (28) . We tested whether galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme (37) , and sialyltransferase, an enzyme localized to both the trans-Golgi and the TGN (38; see also reference 2), also return to the ER in the presence of BFA.
The 300-kD man6P receptor was used as a marker for the action of galactosyl-and sialyltransferases. This receptor provides a sensitive means to detect glycosyltransferase action, since it contains 19 potential N-linked oligosaccharide addition sites (30) and is highly glycosylated. The experiment was carried out as follows. CHO cells were labeled with [35S]methionlne and cysteine for 60 rain to label newly synthesized rnan6P receptors. At this time, labeled man6P receptors reside in the ER, since these receptors require up to 3 h to fold and be completely exported from this compartment (19, 40) . Cells were then chased for various times in the presence of BFA, and the potential acquisition of galactose residues was determined by affinity chromatography of isolated man6P receptors on columns of the galactosespecific lectin, RCA-I (1). To further increase the sensitivity of the assay, we used CHO clone 1021 cells that lack apparent sialyltransferase activity (6, 8) . In these cells, any added galactose residues will be present at the termini of N-linked oligosaccharides and fully accessible for optimal lectin binding (1). Fig . I (top) shows the results obtained from such an experiment. Man6P receptors isolated from cells immediately after the labeling period should not have contained galacrose. As expected, none of the man6P receptors bound to RCA-I agarose; all were recovered in the flowthrough fraction. In contrast, with increasing times of BFA treatment, man6P receptors acquired the ability to be retained on an RCA-I column, and could be eluted from such columns with galactose. Quantitative analysis of this experiment (Fig. I, bottom) showed that half of the man6P receptors gained the Triangles, +BFA; squares, -BFA. capacity to bind RCA-I agarose within '~2 h. This was somewhat slower than the rate observed in the absence of BFA (hr~ = 80 rain). A control experiment showed that galactose addition was not due to the action of newly synthesized galactosyltransferase, also accumulated in the ER, since cyclobeximide had essentially no effect on the extent of galactose addition (not shown).
RCA-I lectin binds to galactose residues present on both N-and O-linked oligosaccharides (1) . To determine if the binding observed was due to the addition of N-linked galactose residues, we carried out a parallel experiment using CHO clone 15B cells that lack the activity of the medial Golgi enzyme, GlcNAc transferase I (20) . In these cells, Figure 3 . Man6P receptors acquire limited sialic acid within the ER of BFA-treated cells. CHO wild type cells were metabolically labeled for 60 rain in the presence or absence of 10 #g/ml BFA and then chased in the presence or absence of BFA for the indicated times. Fresh BFA was added after 4 h to ensure its continued action (13) . Man6P receptors were then isolated by affinity chromatography and applied to slug lectin-Affigel columns. The percentage of man6P receptors eluted from such columns was determined by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms as in Fig. 1 .
galactose cannot be added to N-linked oligosaccharides because the oligosaccharides lack penultimate GlcNAc. O-linked sugar assembly is unaffected, since the O-linked sugar acceptor would be GalNAc, rather than GlcNAc, As shown in Fig. 2 , man6P receptors isolated from CHO clone 15B cells, incubated in the presence or absence of BFA for 3 h, did not bind to RCA-I columns. Failure of these receptors to bind to RCA-I columns was not due to the presence of sialic acid-blocked, O-linked gaiactose, because neuraminidase treatment did not increase the RCA-I binding capacity of the isolated receptors (not shown). We conclude that man6P receptors within the ER acquire N-linked galactose in BFA-treated CHO cells. This is consistent with recent results of Lippincott-Schwartz et al. (29) who used indirect immunofluorescence to show the essentially quantitative redistribution of galactosyltransferase to the ER in BFAtreated cells.
Sialic acid addition was monitored in BFA-treated, CHO wild-type cells, using the sialic acid-specific lectin from the slug, L/max flavus. Fig. 3 shows the kinetics with which man6P receptors acquired the capacity to bind to slug lectin columns and be eluted by excess sialic acid. In the absence of BFA, man6P receptors acquired sialic acid during their transit through the Golgi complex. Sialic acid addition was extensive after 2 h of chase, and by 4 h, 66 % of newly synthesized man6P receptors had acquired the ability to bind to slug lectin-Afligel, as we have previously shown (17) . In the presence of BFA, <10% of total man6P receptor molecules bound to slug lectin-Atfigel after 8 h of incubation (Fig. 3 ). This small amount of sialic acid addition was not due to newly synthesized sialyltransferase because it was also observed in ~e presence of cycloheximide (not shown). The electrophoretic mobility of the sialic acid-containing man6P isolated, digested with pronase to prepare glycopeptides, and then further digested with/3-galactosidase to cleave [3H]galactose from oligosaccharides that had not received sialic acid. Cleavage products were resolved by Sephadex G25 chromatography; fractions eluting at the void volume (which resisted B-galactosidase cleavage and thus contain sialic acid) are shown. The counts per minute in the excluded peak of the control reaction (-BFA) represents 4% of the total glycopeptide radioactivity recovered. In other experiments, as much as 6% resialylation was observed.
receptors was faster in BFA-treated cells (not shown), indicating that these receptors contained significantly fewer sialic acid residues than native man6P receptors (17) . These experiments indicate that either a very limited amount of sialyltransferase activity was present in the ER after 8 h with BFA, or alternatively, that the bulk of sialyltransferase activity was not redistributed to the ER after 8 h. It is important to note that sialyltransferase could have been redistributed to the ER in BFA, but might not have been able to function there.
Under normal conditions, man6P receptors recycle from the cell surface to the TGN, where they come into contact with sialyltransferase (10, 17, 26, 35), but not galactosyltransferase (10) . We reasoned that if sialyltransferase failed to return to the ER in BFA, this enzyme should remain in the TGN, and thus be able to act upon man6P receptors arriving in that compartment. To test this, we used an experimental scheme devised by Duncan and Kornfeld (10) to measure the transport of man6P receptors from the cell surface back to the TGN. The approach uses CHO clone 13 cells, in which glycoproteins lack galactose residues and thus can be labeled at the plasma membrane using galactosyltransferase and UDP-[3H]galactose. The transport of man6P receptors from the surface to the TGN is then monitored by the addition of sialic acid residues to their 3H-labeled oligosaccharide side chains (10) .
CHO clone 13 ceils were surface labeled at 4°C and warmed for either 0 or 6 h in the presence or absence of BFA. At the end of the incubation, man6P receptors were isolated and incubated with pronase to obtain glycopeptides. Sialic acid acquisition was then determined by digestion with ~-galactosidase and gel filtration chromatography. If an oligosac-charide received sialic acid, the 3H-labeled glycopeptide would resist/~-galactosidase cleavage and be excluded from Sephadex G25. In contrast, digestion of galaetose-terminating oligosaccharides would yield [3H]galactose, which would be included in the gel filtration column (10) .
When cells were harvested immediately after surface labeling, essentially no radioactivity was found in excluded column fractions (Fig. 4, open circles) , as would be expected, since at this time, man6P receptor glycopeptides should not contain sialic acid. In contrast, sialic acid addition was readily observed when cells were recultured for 6 h in either the presence or the absence of BFA, as monitored by the presence of 3H-glycopeptides in the void volume fraction (Fig. 4, solid symbols) . Although the extent of sialylation was reproducibly lower ('o65 %) in the presence of BFA than in its absence, significant addition of sialic acid was detected under both conditions. The lower level of sialylation observed in BFA may be explained, in part, by a 20 % decrease in the rate of endocytosis observed in the presence of 10/zg/ml BFA (32) . In summary, this experiment demonstrates that at least a large proportion of sialyltransferase activity was present in a compartment reached by cell surface man6P receptors in BFA-treated cells. This compartment cannot represent the ER, since man6P receptors pulse-labeled there were not modified by sialyltransferase (Fig. 3) .
We also used the man6P receptor as an additional marker to test whether transient occupants of the TGN return to the ER in BFA. CHO cells were metabolically labeled and chased for 4 h to permit newly synthesized man6P receptors to achieve their steady-state distribution, primarily in endosomes, the plasma membrane, and the TGN (7, 15, 16, 22) . The reversible inhibitor of Golgi tx-mannosidase I, dMM (4), was included in the labeling and chase media, so that man6P receptors within and beyond the TGN would bear high-mannose oligosaccharides. Next, dMM was washed away, and cells were incubated for various lengths of time in the presence or absence of BFA. We then monitored the potential galactosylation of man6P receptors that would occur if they returned to the ER.
In the absence of BFA, high mannose oligosaccharidecontaining man6P receptors within and beyond the TGN would not be expected to gain access to the mannosidases and glycosyltransferases that lie proximal to the TGN (10). This was verified by isolating man6P receptors after various chase intervals and subjecting them to RCA-I chromatography. Fig. 5 (bottom) presents the results of such an experiment. In the absence of BFA, ,o7% of the mantP receptors bound to RCA-I at time zero, showing that the dMM was >90 % effective in inhibiting o~-mannosidase I. After a chase period of up to 6 h, there was only a very slight increase ('o5 %) in the fraction of man6P receptors that bound to an RCA-I column. These results confirm that the majority of CHO cell man6P receptors do not appear to return to the site of Golgi o~-mannosidase I (cis/medial Golgi) after transport to the TGN (10) .   Fig, 5 (top) shows the results obtained if man6P receptors were pulse-labeled either in the ER (squares) or chased to compartments beyond the TGN (triangles) in the presence of dMM, and then further chased for various times without DMM, but in the presence of BFA. If the receptors were present in the ER, they were efficiently modified by galactosyltransferase. The rate of galactose addition was slightly slower than that observed in the absence of dMM pretreatmerit ( Fig. 1) , probably due to the time required to reverse the effect of dMM (4, 10, 33) . On the other hand, if the receptors were permitted to pass through the TGN prior to the addition of BFA, only a very small increase was detected in the amount of man6P receptors containing galactose, even after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 5, triangles) . The small increase observed ('~8%) was very close to that observed in the absence of BFA (Fig. 5, bottom) . Duncan and Kornfeld have shown that only '~10% of man6P receptors labeled at the surface of CHO cells can be detected to acquire sialic acid upon their return to the TGN after 6 h of reculture (10) . In our hands, only ,x,4-6% of the surface-labeled receptor acquired sialic acid after 6 hours (Fig. 4) . If this value represents the total amount of man6P receptor transitting through the TGN in 6 h, it would be difficult to detect the potential return of such a small quantity of man6P receptors from the TGN to the ER, especially with the ,'~2-h lag for galactose addition in that compartment (Fig.  5) . However, results identical to those shown in Fig. 5 were obtained using BW5147 ceils, in which 40% of surfacelabeled man6P receptors return to the TGN in 3 h (10). This strongly supports the conclusion that the majority of man6P receptors within and beyond the TGN do not return to the ER in BFA.
We have shown that the 300-kD man6P receptor, when pulse-labeled within the ER of BFA-treated cells, acquires numerous N-linked galactose residues and many fewer sialic acid residues. These data confirm the findings of Lippincott-Schwartz et al. (29) who have used immunofluoresccnce to show that the trans-Golgi enzyme, galactosyltransferase, returns to the ER in the presence of BFA. In addition, our experiments suggest that sialyltransferase has a different fate in BFA than galactosyltransferase, since the half time for sialic acid addition to proteins within the ER (,~60 h) was 30 times greater than that measured for galactose addition. The simplest explanation for these findings would be that sialyltransferase, a component of the TGN, is not redistributed to the ER in BFA, while the trans-Golgi enzyme, galactosyltransferase, is. If true, this supports the proposal that the trans-Golgi and TGN are distinct compartments (21) .
The strongest line of evidence supporting the idea that the TGN is insensitive to BFA comes from an experiment in which we monitored the transport of surface-labeled man6P receptors from the surface back to the TGN. Man6P receptors were transported to a compartment housing active sialyltransferase, whether or not the culture media contained BFA. Moreover, this compartment was not the ER, since man6P receptors pulse-labeled within the ER did not receive sialic acid. Unfortunately, our attempts to localize sialyltransferase by indirect immunofluorescence under these conditions were unsuccessful, probably due to the particularly low abundance of this enzyme in cultured cells. Nevertheless, although not shown directly, it is most likely that the sialyltransferase-containing compartment represents the TGN.
Ulmer and Palade have recently shown that the protein, glycophorin, acquired O-linked sialic acid when present in the ER of BFA-treated erythroleukemia cells (45) . However, these workers noted that sialylation was not complete, even after 6 h. The O-linked oligosaccharides of glycophorin contain sialic acid both in ~-2,3 linkage to galactose, as well as in ot-2,6 linkage to GalNAc (43) . If the GalNAc-specific sialyltransferase is located in the trans-Golgi along with galactosyltransferase, whereas the Gal-specific sialyltransferase is located primarily in the ""I'GN, only the GalNAcspecific enzyme would redistribute to the ER in BFA. Under these conditions, O-linked oligosaccharides would become partially sialylated, while N-linked sugars would not. If this is correct, the findings of Ulmer and Palade (45) would be entirely consistent with those reported here and elsewhere (9, 28) .
Several models have been proposed to explain BFA action. One possibility is that the target of BFA is associated with the ER. By blocking ER export, BFA might be uncovering a vesicular recycling pathway that functions between the Golgi and ER (9, 28, 29) . This model could easily explain why most Golgi enzymes are redistributed to the ER, if one assumes that each cisterna of the Golgi complex communicates with its proximal neighbor by shuttling transport vesicles. This model does not explain why TGN components do not return to the ER, because putative shuttling vesicles might be expected to move between the TGN and trans-Golgi as frequently as they traverse between transand medial Golgi cisternae. If the target of BFA is indeed the ER, our data would suggest that transport between the TGN and trans-Golgi cisternae differs significantly from transport between more proximal Golgi cisternae.
Another possibility is that BFA acts on the Golgi complex and interferes with the mechanism whereby Golgi compartmentation is maintained (9, 28, 29) . This model would re-quire that cis-, medial and trans-Golgi cisternae be related by a common compartmentation machinery that would not apply to the TGN. Whatever mechanism BFA uses to block ER export and disrupt Golgi organization, the apparent insensitivity of the TGN to BFA action highlights a fundamental difference between this compartment and more proximal Golgi cisternae.
Unlike the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi cisternae, the TGN functions to sort proteins into distinct classes of transport vesicles, bound for prelysosomes (10), secretory storage granules (44) , and specific domains of the plasma membrane (14, 36) . The TGN is the site to which man6P receptors recycle (10, 17, 26, 35) , and where viral glycoproteins accumulate at 20°C (24, 41). The TGN is also a much more extended and tubular structure than the other Golgi cisternae, and thus, it is distinguished by its unique morphological characteristics. Despite numerous distinctions between the TGN and other Golgi cisternae, it is likely that the TGN is nevertheless, an integral part of the Golgi complex. Grifliths et al. (25) have shown that the TGN and more proximal Golgi cisternae are highly interrelated structures. At 20°C, the TGN increases in size, concomitant with a decrease in size of preceding Golgi compartments (25) . In addition, these workers have calculated that 12% of the TGN surface area is comprised of flattened cisternae which are morphologically indistinguishable from, and located immediately adjacent to, the other cisternae of the Golgi stack. Thus, although the TGN is functionally distinct from other Golgi cisternae (21), it is appropriate to consider it as a specialized subcompartment of the Golgi complex. An important future challenge will be to elucidate the mechanism by which the TGN gains (and maintains) its identity.",Compartmentation of the Golgi complex: brefeldin-A distinguishes trans- Golgi cisternae from the trans-Golgi network,,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2116293/,22,4002,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,dab21bebc7d9ee2f77332c23b420280ee74772fd,"The infection dynamics of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were studied in randomly selected Norwegian dairy herds. A total of 134 herds were tested twice, six months apart. The herds were classified as positive for BRSV if at least one animal between 150 and 365 days old tested positive for antibodies against BRSV, thereby representing herds that had most likely had the virus present during the previous year. The prevalence of positive herds at the first and second sampling was 34 per cent and at 41 per cent, respectively, but varied greatly between regions. Negative herds were found in close proximity to positive herds. Some of these herds remained negative despite several new infections nearby. Of the herds initially being negative, 42 per cent changed status to positive during the six months. This occurred at the same rate during summer as winter, but a higher rate of animals in the herds was positive if it took place during winter. Of the herds initially being positive, 33 per cent changed to negative. This indicates that an effective strategy to lower the prevalence and the impact of BRSV could be to employ close surveillance and place a high biosecurity focus on the negative herds.","Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex, detrimentally impacting production and animal welfare in the cattle industry all over the world (Griffin 1997 , Snowder and others 2006 , Brodersen 2010 . Clinical signs vary from none to severe, with most outbreaks occurring during the winter season (van der Poel and others 1993, others 1997, Valarcher and Taylor 2007) .
In areas where vaccination is rarely used, which is the case in Norway, the prevalence of BRSV infection at herd level, or in a population, is usually based on the detection of antibodies in serum or milk from a group of animals in the herd. The prevalence is usually found to be high (Elvander 1996 , Paton and others 1998 , Uttenthal and others 2000 , Gulliksen and others 2009 , Ohlson and others 2010 . Such screenings have some disadvantages; animals will remain seropositive for several years after an infection. Additionally, calves that receive colostrum from seropositive cows will also be positive. Most dairy calves will not have detectable maternal antibodies after the age of five months others 1986, Uttenthal and others 2000) . Serological methods, therefore, have low specificity for distinguishing between animals or herds with ongoing infection versus the past. The ideal method to describe the occurrence of BRSV would be to detect the virus. However, infected animals do not have the virus circulating in the blood, they shed the virus for a short time period and the laboratory methods for detection are expensive. This means that large-scale studies on the prevalence of herds with ongoing or recent infection of BRSV are challenging, which has, in turn, led to a lack of knowledge on the spreading pattern of BRSV. Factors, such as rate of new introduction to herds, elimination rate, seasonal pattern and virus reservoir are not well described.
More extensive serological studies where herds are classified according to BRSV status should be based on an investigation of animals chosen with the intent to reduce the possible time period between sampling and infection. The number of animals needed to classify the herds correctly as infected or not will rely on several factors, one of the main ones being the within-herd prevalence. Generally, BRSV is reported to give high morbidity due to the rapid spread of the virus within herds causing high within-herd prevalence (Rossi and Kiesel 1974 , Stott and others 1980 , Verhoeff and van Nieuwstadt 1984 . Bidokhti and others (2009) found the mean within-herd prevalence of adult animals to be 70 per cent and 93 per cent in herds tested twice, also showing that the seropositivity increased with age. If the within-herd prevalence is 70 per cent and an ELISA with a sensitivity of 94.6 per cent and specificity of 100 per cent is used, it can be calculated by the methods described by Martin and others (1992) that the sensitivity at the herd level will be 66, 89, 96, 99 and 100 per cent, respectively, when one to five animals are included. With a withinherd prevalence of 93 per cent, it will be 88 per cent and 99 per cent for one and two animals sampled, and 100 per cent if three or more are sampled. A study by Hägglund and others (2006) suggested conducting such studies by using three animals in each herd.
The aim of the present study was to 
The study was designed as a repeated, cross-sectional survey and performed between June 2004 and December 2006. In order to cover all parts of Norway, 30 veterinary districts across the country were selected. The selection of districts was based on geographic location, animal density and that the veterinarians in the district had a health service agreement with The Norwegian Cattle Health Services (NDHRS). The 30 districts represented herds from 16 out of the 19 Norwegian counties. Dairy herds recorded in the NDHRS as having at least 15 cow-years were included for further random sampling. One cow-year is the sum of the total of individual feed days for all cows in a herd over the course of a calendar year divided by 365. Herds located in the selected districts were stratified according to herd size in the following four groups: (1) herds with 15-24.9 cow-years (n=1807); (2) herds with 25-49.9 cow-years (n=568); (3) herds with 50-99.9 cowyears (n=62); (4) herds with more than 100 cow-years (n=6). Using random computer sampling (SAS V.9.1), on principle, two herds were selected from each district in the first group, four in the second group, two in the third group and all herds in the fourth group (Gulliksen and others 2009 Vaccination against BRSV had not been performed in any of the study herds. In each herd, blood from an average of five calves was collected on two occasions. There was some variation in the number of tested calves due to practical circumstances such as number of available calves at the time of sampling (distribution shown in Table 1 ). The calves were aged 0-365 days, and the animals were randomly selected at each sampling. This gave a total of 1348 blood samples collected from 1294 calves. Of the samples, 470 were from calves less than 150 days old. Out of these, 159 samples from 157 calves tested positive for antibodies to BRSV. They were excluded from analysis to prevent misclassification caused by the presence of maternal antibodies. The calves less than 150 days old with negative antibody titre were included. Finally, this gave a total of 1189 samples collected from 1137 calves included in the analysis. In each herd, the two samplings were performed approximately 6 months apart. In 17 of the 134 herds, samples were only available from one sampling for different reasons, for example, too few available animals, or farmers closing down their activities.
From September 2005, samples of bulk tank milk were collected from 46 of 134 (34 per cent) study herds. The bulk tank milk samples were obtained on the same day as the first sampling of blood from the calves in the eight counties.
On the day of collection, blood and bulk milk samples were centrifuged and the serum or skimmed milk was extracted before being stored at −20°C until they were analysed. Analysis for the presence of antibodies against BRSV was performed using a commercial ELISA kit (Svanovir, Svanova Biotech AB, Uppsala). The manufacturer's instructions were followed. The optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm and corrected by subtraction of OD for the negative control antigen. If the OD value was ≥0.2, the sample was classified as positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the test for this cut-off reported by the manufacturer were 94.6 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively.
The classification of the herds was based on the results of the antibody test of the selected calves. The herd was classified as 'positive' if one or more of the sampled calves were positive for BRSV antibodies. Positive herds were considered to have had the virus present in the herd during the past year.
The prevalence of positive herds was calculated for the first (n=134 herds) and second (n=117 herds) samplings. An overall prevalence in the country was calculated for the two samplings viewed together. Hence, if a herd was positive in one of the samplings, it was defined as positive. An overall prevalence of positive herds in each of the 16 counties was estimated in the same way.
The results of the serological and bulk milk screen were compared for herds that underwent both tests.
The impact of herd size on the prevalence of BRSV was examined by classification according to the number of cow-years in the herd. Of the 117 herds, 20 had a size of 50 or more cow-years and were classified as large herds, and 96 of them had less than 50 cow-years and were classified as small herds. The exact number of cow-years was missing for one herd which was excluded from the calculations on herd size. Contingency analysis was performed with number of cowyears ≥50 and <50 as the independent variables and serostatus from sampling one to two as the dependent variables.
The study herds were divided into two groups according to the season between the two samplings. The winter season is December, January and February, and the summer is June, July and August. Seventy-four herds had winter between the two samplings, while 26 had summer. Seventeen of the herds did not fit into either category and were excluded from the calculations on seasonal variation.
Contingency analysis was performed for two parameters. The independent variable was herds sampled during the winter or summer season. Two dependent variables were analysed 1. Change from negative to positive at herd level 2. The number of positive animals tested=100 per cent versus <100 per cent.
Relationships were deemed to be statistically significant if the P value was less than 0.05. All associations were calculated using Fisher's Exact Test. The analyses were performed using JMP 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
The prevalence of herds with antibodies against BRSV in serum at the time of the first sampling was 34 per cent (45 out of 134) and 41 per cent (48 out of 117) at the second sampling. The overall prevalence of herds positive in any of the samplings was 54 per cent (72 out of 134). The geographical results of the prevalence study are shown in Fig 1. Totally, 233 (20 per cent) of the 1189 samples were positive for antibodies against BRSV. The mean age of the included calves was 197.7 days, with a sd of 75.1 days. The median was 198 days.
The numbers of dairy herds classified as positive and negative for BRSV at the two samplings are shown in Table 2 . Twenty-seven (33 per cent) of the 81 herds initially being negative changed to positive, and 9 (33 per cent) of these 27 herds showed all animals positive on the second sampling. Fifteen (42 per cent) of the 36 herds initially being positive changed to negative, and 21 of them (58 per cent) remained positive on second sampling. Of the herds negative on first sampling, 54 (46 per cent) were also negative on the second. The prevalence of herds positive for antibodies in bulk tank milk was 30 per cent (14 of 46 herds). Comparison of the results of the bulk tank milk testing with the serological investigation showed that 10 (71 per cent) of the 14 herds that were positive for antibodies in bulk milk sampling were classified as negative based on the serological analysis of young animals. Altogether, 31 (97 per cent) of the 32 herds negative for antibodies in bulk tank milk were classified as negative based on the serological examination in calves. One herd was negative for bulk milk but had one seropositive calf. This calf was retested 6 months later and was still positive, even though the remaining calves were negative.
The within-herd prevalence of the positive herds varied from 10 per cent to 100 per cent, with a mean of 55 per cent. The distribution of the number of calves positive for antibodies within herds is shown in Table 1 and is based on results from both samplings. The mean number of animals sampled on each sampling occasion was 4.7.
Contingency analysis of herd size versus changes in classification showed that there was no significant difference between large and small herds in the risk of changing from negative to positive. However, larger herds were more likely to change status from positive to negative (P value 0.015).
There were distinct differences in both prevalence and changes in BRSV antibody status at herd level between the two samplings in different areas (Fig 1) . In the counties with the highest density of cattle (Fig 1, numbers 4, 7, 9 and 15 ) the prevalence of herds defined as positive on first, second or both samplings was 82, 94, 64 and 75 per cent for each of the four counties, respectively. Several counties had no positive herds (Fig 1, numbers 1, 2 and 6 ). Another county (Fig 1, number  17) had a high proportion of negative herds. In the county with the highest density of cattle (Fig 1, number 15 ) there were herds classified as negative on both samplings, and herds changing from negative to positive and from positive to negative within a small geographical area. For a smaller area in the northern part of county number 7 (Fig 1) , seven out of eight of the herds were negative for antibodies against BRSV on the first sampling, and positive on the second. In six of them, all tested calves were positive on the second sampling. One of the herds was negative on both samplings and negative on the bulk milk sample, that is, having no immunity in the herd. Within the sampling period there was a confirmed clinical outbreak of respiratory disease in this area.
The number of herds tested and their distribution by county is presented in Table 3 .
Of the herds with winter between the samplings, 23 per cent (17 out of 74) changed from negative to positive. Of the herds with summer between samplings, the respective number equals 23 per cent (6 out of 26). All the herds in which 100 per cent of the animals tested positive on the second sampling had winter between the samplings.
The present study is based on a nationwide longitudinal study where herds were classified as BRSV-positive or BRSV-negative. The classification was based on individual sampling of an average of five animals less than one year old. If one or more of the sampled calves between 150 and 365 days of age were positive for BRSV antibodies, the herd was classified as positive. The positive herds have most likely had BRSV circulation during the previous year.
The within-herd prevalence in this study was low, compared to other studies (Hägglund and others 2006, Bidokhti and others 2009 ). The reason for this could be that the herds were randomly selected, and that samples from young animals were collected. In the study by Hägglund and others (2006) the within-herd prevalence was considerably higher, but the herds chosen all had a history of respiratory disease. Another study by Bidokhti and others (2009) on adult animals suggest high within-herd prevalence also in herds with no known history of respiratory disease. They also showed higher seropositivity with increasing age. In the present study, all sampled calves were positive in only approximately a quarter of the positive herds.
Positive animals less than 150 days old were excluded from the analyses in this study to avoid interference from maternal antibodies. The calves less than 150 days old that were negative were presumed to be truly negative and included in the analyses since removing them would entail the loss of valuable information. All the analyses were also performed for a dataset where all calves under 150 days old (both positive and negative) were removed and the results remained the same but with less power (data not shown). The exclusion of the positive animals less than 150 days old reduced the number of tested animals in some herds. Three or more calves were included on 93 per cent of the occasions. Hägglund and others (2006) suggested three sampled animals in a herd were sufficient for correct classification of a herd's infectious status. If the calculations of Martin and others (1992) are used with the mean within-herd prevalence calculated in the present study (55 per cent), the sensitivity of the classification on herd level will be 52, 77, 89, 95 and 97 per cent when one to five animals are included. This shows that even if the within-herd prevalence was lower than expected, the sensitivity is acceptable.
The classification system in the present study might give both false positive and false negative herds. The main reason for false positive herds would be the cut-off value for maternal antibodies (150 days). It is possible that there are false positive herds due to calves with an unusually long duration of maternal antibodies. Uttenthal and others (2000) found that maternal antibodies of dairy calves are not likely to be detected after five months. Baker and others (1986) found an average duration of 3.2 months, but up to 6.8 months in some animals. Maternal antibodies are reported to last longer in beef than dairy cattle, with an average of 6.1 (Fulton and others 2004) . In the present study, only dairy herds were included. Additionally, the positive herds usually had more than one positive animal. Altogether, it is possible for the herds in the present study to be misclassified due to long duration of antibodies in some animals, but this will probably only apply to a relatively low number of herds.
Herds might also be misclassified as negative. The fewer animals tested in a herd, the higher risk of false negative classification of the herd. One factor that can give false negative results is that presence of maternal antibodies in young calves might depress the natural development of immunity after infection. Kimman and others (1987) and Uttenthal and others (2000) conclude that maternal antibodies markedly suppress the humoral immune response, leading to shorter duration of humoral immunity. This might give false negative results in individuals that are tested serologically. Their conclusions are based on investigation of a relatively low number of calves observed for a short period of time, leaving questions on how the antibody titre will develop further. The laboratory methods were also different from the ones used in the present study, leaving questions open as to exactly what degree this impairment will influence the test strategy used in the present study. The degree of impairment of the humoral response is also likely to be affected by the level of maternal antibodies of each individual; the lower the level of maternal antibodies, the less impairment. It is possible that some animals were falsely classified as negative in the present study, but the number and age dispersion of the calves used to classify the herds makes it unlikely that this applies to many herds.
The calculated prevalence shows that BRSV is a common infection in Norway. The prevalence estimate is lower than that reported in many other countries (Elvander 1996 , Paton and others 1998 , Uttenthal and others 2000 , Luzzago and others 2010 , Ohlson and others 2010 which is probably due to the different methods used to estimate the prevalence. In Sweden, the prevalence based on bulk tank milk has been reported to be between 41 per cent and 89 per cent (Elvander 1996 , Ohlson and others 2010) and up to 100 per cent in (100) Serum of an average of five animals in each herd was tested for antibodies against BRSV at each occasion. A herd was classified as positive if at least one sampled animal was antibody positive BRSV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus England and Wales (Paton and others 1998) . In another study based on pooled milk samples from five primiparous cows, a prevalence of 85 per cent was found (Ohlson and others 2010) . In Norway, Gulliksen and others (2009) found the prevalence of BRSV in calves up to 12 months of age to be 31 per cent. In the same study, 71 per cent of the herds were categorised as positive based on the finding of at least one antibody-positive calf. However, calves young enough to still have maternal BRSV antibodies circulating were not excluded from the analysis.
In the present study, the prevalence of herds positive on bulk tank milk testing was low. This was probably due to the fact that these samples were only collected in areas with a low prevalence of BRSV. When comparing the results of the serum and bulk milk sampling, the majority of herds positive on bulk tank milk were negative based on serological analysis. Ninety-seven percent of the herds that were negative on bulk tank milk samples were also negative on serology, and bulk tank milk is therefore convenient for the classification of negative herds.
The study indicates that the prevalence of BRSV is highly variable between counties. The counties with the highest cattle density generally had a higher proportion of positive herds, but no link was found between herd size and the risk of being classified as positive. A previous study in Norway (Norström and others 1999) found that the risk of transmission of respiratory disease between herds was high. Nevertheless, in the present study, there are examples of counties with herds in all categories close together: negative herds, positive herds, as well as herds initially being negative changing to positive and herds initially positive changing to negative. This pattern is also seen in several smaller geographical districts. Thus, the herds grouped within a restricted area do not necessarily change infection status in the same direction. In one of the counties (Fig 1, number 15) , the classification status of the herds is especially complex, with all types of classifications present within a small area. In another small district (Fig  1, northern part of county number 7) a clinical outbreak of respiratory disease was registered and most herds were infected. In spite of this, one herd stayed negative throughout the epidemic, which demonstrates that a herd can keep its negative status without immunity despite an ongoing epidemic in the area.
This study is not sufficiently extensive to determine whether large areas are free from BRSV despite certain counties only containing herds which tested negative. The number of sampled herds in these counties was low, and negative and positive herds are located close together in other areas. A high proportion of herds must be sampled to be able to classify whole regions.
New introduction of BRSV to the herds occurred at the same rate regardless of season. These findings contrast with the findings of Van der Poel and others (1993) who found that the highest incidence of primary infection was in the autumn or winter season. Baker and others (1997) also report that there is a peak occurrence of BRSV infections in the autumn and winter, and that primary infection in other seasons is rare. The fact that new infections occur throughout the summer could explain how the virus can survive between winter seasons. There is some uncertainty about these results as the samples were collected only every sixth month. Interestingly, it was also found that the introduction of BRSV into a herd in the winter leads to a higher proportion of seropositive animals than such introduction in the summer. This is in accordance with more clinical outbreaks taking place during winter due to higher infectious pressure because of indoor housing with tighter relations between animals, poor ventilation and high humidity (Stott and others 1980, Hägglund 2005) . In the summer, the infectious pressure is likely to be low and, consequently, fewer animals are likely to be infected in the herd, resulting in less clinical disease.
The presence of a lower rate of animals positive for antibodies against BRSV, and fewer clinical signs of infection in the summer, may suggest that a low-grade infection in a herd or individual animals persists or maintains the infection over summer. This would make the task of working with diagnostics and the risk of infection more complicated. Van der Poel and others (1993) suggested that low-grade infections might be a means for the virus to survive in a population during the summer.
The current findings are of importance for the future control of BRSV which should be focused at the herd level. By detection and surveillance of negative herds combined with implementation of biosecurity measures in these, the occurrence of BRSV could be reduced. Effective biosecurity measures are not well documented for BRSV, but in a study by Ohlson and others (2010) they found that biosecurity in terms of providing boots for visitors in herds were associated with lower prevalence of BRSV. Given the high volatility herd infection status and the close proximity between negative and positive herds, individual examination of each herd may be necessary. Further studies with the inclusion of a higher number of animals in each herd, and a higher number of herds in an area, are necessary.
This study revealed that there is high variation in prevalence and pattern of infection dynamics within and between herds in the different regions. There are rapid shifts in infectious status at herd level. The rate of new infections at herd level does not vary with season. Negative herds were found in close proximity to positive herds. Combined with a high elimination rate in infected herds, it should be possible to lower the prevalence of BRSV by preventing the introduction of virus into herds throughout the year. A suitable strategy could be to employ close surveillance and focus on the negative herds followed by high biosecurity to avoid new introductions of virus in these herds.",Bovine respiratory syncytial virus: infection dynamics within and between herds,"Klem, T.

54,9a8ffb71928a37a550e689f36fa3196493e036fe,"It has been proposed that cholesterol in host cell membranes plays a pivotal role for cell entry of HIV. However, it remains largely unknown why virions prefer cholesterol-rich heterogeneous membranes to uniformly fluid membranes for membrane fusion. Using giant plasma membrane vesicles containing cholesterol-rich ordered and cholesterol-poor fluid lipid domains, we demonstrate that the HIV receptor CD4 is substantially sequestered into ordered domains, whereas the co-receptor CCR5 localizes preferentially at ordered/disordered domain boundaries. We also show that HIV does not fuse from within ordered regions of the plasma membrane but rather at their boundaries. Ordered/disordered lipid domain coexistence is not required for HIV attachment but is a prerequisite for successful fusion. We propose that HIV virions sense and exploit membrane discontinuities to gain entry into cells. This study provides surprising answers to the long-standing question about the roles of cholesterol and ordered lipid domains in cell entry of HIV and perhaps other enveloped viruses.","Cell membranes consist of numerous proteins and lipids exhibiting complex behavior that includes organization into dynamic nanodomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol that are sometimes referred to as ""lipid rafts"" (1, 2) . Accumulating evidence indicates that membrane domain organization plays a vital role in cell signaling and adaptive immune responses to combat infections by many pathogens (3) (4) (5) . For example, HIV has evolved to exploit organized membrane domains to gain entry into host cells (6) (7) (8) (9) . It is well established that recognition and attachment of HIV to host cells are mediated by the binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the cell-surface receptor CD4 and a co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 (10, 11) . After attachment, membrane fusion mediated by subunit gp41 of the envelope glycoprotein leads to cell entry. Because CD4 has been found to associate with detergent-resistant fractions of the cell membrane, it has been assumed that cholesterol-and sphingomyelin-rich rafts are platforms for HIV entry (12, 13) . However, because lipids in cholesterolrich regions are more tightly packed and more ordered than those in the surrounding membrane, these sites may seem energetically unfavorable for membrane fusion, thereby raising doubts about the involvement of ordered lipid regions in the fusion step of HIV entry.
Because ordered lipid domains are thought to be dynamically fluctuating nanoscopic assemblies of lipids and resident proteins in living cells, visualization of the potential involvement of these membrane regions upon entry of viral particles into intact cells remains technically challenging (14, 15) . In a first step toward solving this problem, we showed recently that model membranes with coexisting microscopic ordered and fluid lipid domains were useful in proving that the fusion peptide of gp41 interacts preferentially with ordered/disordered lipid domain boundaries and that these boundaries are also the preferred sites for fusion peptide-mediated membrane fusion (16) . However, these discoveries raised the important question of whether the results obtained in this highly artificial model system could be translated to biological membranes that contain the HIV receptor and co-receptor and to virus particles bearing the full, trimeric, gp120/gp41 complex, that is, whether membrane domain boundaries would still be the preferred sites for virus attachment and/or membrane fusion at the plasma membranes of appropriate target cells. Therefore, we developed a new approach to measuring binding and fusion of HIV particles with plasma membranes to assess the role of membrane heterogeneity in these processes.
We used giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) derived from HeLa cells that stably express the CD4 receptor and CCR5 co-receptor (CD4 + /CCR5 + ), investigated the lateral partitioning of both receptors in these membranes, and imaged the preferred regions of HIV binding and fusion at the single-particle level (Fig. 1A) . GPMVs show temperaturedependent, micrometer-scale liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered (Lo/Ld) phase separation and have been extremely useful to study the dynamics and lateral distribution of resident membrane proteins (17, 18) . Using this approach, we found that lipid order discontinuities in heterogeneous receptor-and co-receptor-containing plasma membranes are important for gp120-mediated receptor/co-receptor targeting and gp41-mediated membrane fusion.
A number of studies have been conducted to localize CD4 and CCR5 in lymphocyte cell membranes. Although the association of CD4 with lipid rafts is generally accepted, divergent conclusions have been reached regarding the raft localization of CCR5 (6, 12) . Confirming previous results, we observed by immunofluorescence that CD4 colocalized with raft-resident ganglioside GM1 in CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells, whereas CCR5 colocalized only partially with GM1 ( fig. S1 ). When we prepared GPMVs from CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells by gentle formaldehyde and dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment (movie S1 and fig. S2, A and B), which forms membrane blebs by releasing otherwise intact cell membranes from the cytoskeleton (17, 18) , we found that most GPMVs showed microscopic Lo/Ld phase separation below 25°C (movie S2 and fig. S2 , C to E). As expected from immunostaining of intact cells, CD4 and GM1 were substantially excluded from the Ld region in GPMVs, indicating the partitioning of CD4 into the Lo region ( Fig. 1 , B and C). Preferential localization of CCR5 at the boundaries between Lo and Ld phases occurred and was evident in cell-attached blebs and cell-detached GPMVs (Fig. 1, B and C) . This result might explain the debate about the controversial association of CCR5 with lipid rafts: CCR5 is not associated with Lo or with Ld lipid phases but accumulates at the boundaries between them. Very similar results were obtained with an alternative procedure to induce membrane blebs by the application of small concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) ( fig. S3 ), suggesting that the results are independent of the blebbing agent and that the resulting GPMVs do not have serious membrane defects.
Recognition of Lo/Ld membrane boundaries by HIV Next, we examined whether and how HIV envelope (Env) particles interact with GPMVs. Murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) pseudotyped with HIV gp120/gp41 and fluorescently labeled with mKO-Gag were incubated with CD4 + /CCR5 + GPMVs. We visualized bound particles by epifluorescence microscopy and found that they migrate along The preparation of large-scale phase-separated GPMVs facilitates the study of the lateral distribution of CD4 and CCR5 and the role of ordered lipid domains in HIV entry. Lo and Ld phases on GPMVs are indicated with red and blue lines, respectively. (B and C) Partitioning of CD4 and CCR5 in cell-attached (B) or cell-detached (C) GPMVs. GPMVs were first stained with 1,1′-didodecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) at 4°C for 60 min and then incubated with fluorescent-labeled CTxB (Alexa Fluor 555), anti-CD4 (Alexa Fluor 488), or anti-CCR5 (Alexa Fluor 647) antibodies at 4°C for 60 min. Epifluorescence images of GPMVs performed at room temperature (~22°C) show large-scale Lo/Ld phase coexistence in which DiI and CTxB are used as markers of Ld and Lo phases, respectively. The selected rectangles are enlarged and shown below. (D) HIV binding to cell-attached GPMVs. Cell-attached GPMVs (left) and viruses labeled with mKO-Gag (center) are visualized by bright-field and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively. Image overlay (right) shows that some bright dots (HIV Env particles) indicated by arrows are sitting on the GPMV surface (top). Time series of images from the selected box region shows that the particles bound to GPMV are free to move laterally along the GPMV surface (bottom). A movie version of this figure is available (movie S3). (E and F) HIV binding to the boundaries between Lo and Ld phases in cell-attached (E) or cell-detached (F) GPMVs. GPMVs (left) and HIV Env particles (center) were labeled with DiO and mKO-Gag, respectively. (G) Quantification of virions bound to three different regions (Lo, Ld, and Lo/Ld boundary) of the GPMVs. Data are means ± SD of triplicates. A total of 120 virions were analyzed for their distribution between the three compartments. The largest fraction of virions was found in Lo/Ld boundary regions. Scale bars, 10 mm. the GPMV surfaces ( Fig. 1D and movie S3) . Staining the GPMVs with the Ld marker 3,3′-dilinoleyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) showed that most bound particles localize to Lo/Ld boundary regions in cellattached (Fig. 1E, movie S4, and fig. S4 ) and cell-detached GPMVs ( Fig. 1F and movie S5). We quantified the virions bound to three different regions (Lo, Ld, and Lo/Ld boundaries), as shown in Fig. 1G . To assess whether the targeting of the virions to the Lo/Ld interface is specific to HIV Env, we also performed similar experiments with MLVs pseudotyped with the Env G protein (glycoprotein) from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). VSV-G virions preferentially bound to the Ld phase in GPMVs ( fig. S5 ), indicating that the Lo/Ld boundary interaction is not a general feature of all viral particles and requires HIV Env. Given that CD4 is initially localized in Lo phase regions of the membrane, it seems reasonable to propose that HIV virions bind to CD4-rich Lo phase membrane regions and then move to domain boundaries where they also engage with CCR5. CCR5 binding and the preferential targeting of the gp41 fusion peptide to lipid phase boundaries (16) likely combine to direct the particles for fusion at these boundaries.
To determine whether HIV Env particles indeed fuse with GPMVs at lipid phase boundaries, we first examined whether they fuse with GPMVs in a bulk lipid mixing assay. Virions were labeled with selfquenching concentrations of the fluorescent lipid probe R18 and mixed with unlabeled GPMVs. Lipid mixing was only observed when the GPMVs contained both CD4 and CCR5 but was negligible with GPMVs that were derived from HeLa cells lacking receptors and coreceptors ( Fig. 2A) . Demonstrating the specificity of the HIV/GPMV fusion system, we found that lipid mixing is strongly suppressed by the well-known HIV entry inhibitors maraviroc and enfuvirtide (Fig. 2B ). Maraviroc inhibits binding to the co-receptor CCR5 (19) , and enfuvirtide inhibits fusion by blocking the required conformational change of gp41 (20) . Maraviroc reduced the targeting of HIV virions to phase boundaries (Fig. 2C) , further supporting the notion that CCR5 recognition occurs at these boundaries. By contrast, enfuvirtide had little effect on the boundary preference of HIV binding while still blocking fusion (Fig. 2D ), suggesting that boundary binding alone is not sufficient for fusion; it requires the energy from refolding gp41 into the six-helix bundle structure as well.
We also observed fusion with GPMVs at the single-particle level. The fluorescence of many HIV Env particles that were bound at Lo/Ld phase boundaries spread over time, indicating that the particles fused with the GPMVs (Fig. 2E ). In addition, we carried out electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) in an attempt to directly visualize the process of fusion of viral particles with GPMVs. As previously observed for bare MLVs containing only Gag and Gag-Pol (21), the spherical or tennis racket-shaped particles showed a characteristic morphology with a capsid surrounded by the viral envelope (Fig. 2F ). Representative electron micrographs obtained from four different incubations with two separate viral and two separate GPMV preparations show HIV Env particles in intimate contact with the GPMV surfaces ( Fig. 2G  and fig. S6 ). We also observed membrane perturbations in very confined areas of the GPMV lipid bilayer that may represent fusion intermediates (Fig. 2G ). To ensure that the observed contacts were specific, controls with GPMVs lacking CD4 and CCR5 were mixed with HIV Env particles. Fifteen to 30 randomly selected GPMVs per grid were imaged for three different samples, and no virus-GPMV fusion events were observed. However, the present resolution of the cryoEM images does not permit a distinction between Lo and Ld phases and is thus not sufficient to determine whether fusion occurs at the Lo/Ld phase boundaries.
Next, we examined whether the Lo/Ld phase coexistence on GPMVs is required for HIV Env particle binding and/or fusion. To disrupt Lo phase domains, we treated GPMVs with methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD), which depletes cholesterol from the membranes. MbCD treatment of GPMVs led to a marked change from approximately circular Lo domains to corrugated shapes that are characteristic for bilayers in the gel phase ( Fig. 3A and movie S6). However, cholesterol extraction did not significantly alter the overall surface expression levels of CD4 or CCR5 on GPMVs (Fig. 3B ). Virion binding was quantified by directly counting the number of particles attached to GPMVs (Fig. 3C ) or by a centrifugation-based assay ( fig. S7 ). Regardless of the method, particle binding was high and not diminished by cholesterol depletion of the GPMVs, indicating that the presence of Lo domains is not required for the binding of virions. However, HIV Env particles did not bind to GPMVs lacking CD4 and CCR5, further confirming that their attachment is mediated by these receptors rather than lipid phase separation.
Contrary to virion attachment, disruption of the Lo phase domains in GPMVs by MbCD significantly decreased the efficiency of fusion of HIV Env virions with GPMVs ( Fig. 3D ). This result agrees with a previous report demonstrating a decrease of HIV cell entry after depletion of cholesterol from the host cell membrane (22) . The inhibitory effect on fusion by the disruption of Lo phases and Lo/Ld phase boundaries in GPMVs suggests that the unique properties of these boundaries are responsible for attracting receptors and co-receptors and the high fusogenicity of HIV Env virions at these sites. Thus, the same physical principles that promote fusion peptide-mediated fusion in lipid model membranes, namely, line tension and lipid packing defects at Lo/Ld phase boundaries (23), also provide a significant driving force for membrane fusion of HIV Env viral particles with biological membranes.
Lysolipids, which adopt an inverted-cone molecular shape, have been reported to inhibit fusion in a wide variety of systems owing to their propensity to induce positive intrinsic membrane curvature (24, 25) . Here, we tested whether lysolipids affect the lipid phase behavior of GPMVs and the ability of HIV to fuse with them. Lysosphingomyelin (lysoSM) partially dissolved the Lo domains of GPMVs into much smaller domains, whereas lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) had little effect on Lo domains ( Fig. 4A and movie S7). Although both lysoSM and lysoPC share a choline headgroup and a similar molecular shape, they may differently affect line tension at phase boundaries. LysoSM is a linactant that appears to reduce line tension, whereas lysoPC probably partitions more uniformly into the Ld phase with a lesser effect on line tension. HIV Env virion binding was not affected by lysoSM or lysoPC (Fig. 4B ). However, lysoSM significantly reduced the fusion efficiency of HIV particles, whereas lysoPC had only a moderate effect (Fig. 4B ). Together, these results again support the notion that the site of fusion is the domain boundary region where inhibitory lysoSM is enriched, but lysoPC is not enriched. The same effect could be triggered enzymatically. Treatment of GPMVs with phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which hydrolyzes glycerophospholipids, including PC to lysoPC, had little effect on the lipid phase behavior of GPMVs and HIV fusion, whereas sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase (SCDase), which converts SM into lysoSM, dispersed the Lo domains, which eventually spread over the entire GPMV surface and significantly inhibited fusion (Fig. 4 , C and D). Note that the fluorescent lipid probe DiI always marks the Ld phases in these images. The apparent reversal of contrast in some images is due to different levels of cholesterol that can change the connectivity of Lo phases, as previously demonstrated in model systems (26) .
To further probe the influence of lysolipids on lipid phases and HIV fusion in well-defined model membranes, we used giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of bSM/bPC/bPS/cholesterol (2:1:1:1) as models (16) . Only lysoSM significantly changed the Lo domains in GUVs (Fig. 4E ) and inhibited the fusion of LUVs with HIV fusion peptide-decorated virosomes, whereas lysoPC had only a small effect at the highest concentration (Fig. 4F ). The domain edges first undulated before larger invaginations formed, eventually dispersing the domains into much smaller ones (movie S8). Regulating the size of lipid rafts by using lysosphingolipids has significant consequences not only on HIV entry but also on cell signaling. For example, it is well known that sphingosine-1-phosphate is a potent mediator of numerous signaling pathways (27) and the finding that these signaling mechanisms could be potentiated by raft regulation may be an interesting topic for future investigations. As previously reported, the recruitment of some proteins such as Ras and Rac-1 to domain boundaries may be more general and may contribute to the regulation of signaling pathways by regulating the nature and size of lipid rafts in these systems (28, 29) .
Supported lipid bilayers generated from synthetic and natural lipids have been widely applied since their original introduction (30) , including more recently to study fusion of single particles (16, 31) . The planar geometry of supported membranes has the advantage over GUVs that a large extended membrane can be observed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and, therefore, that large numbers of single events can be simultaneously recorded with high signal-to-noise ratio in each experiment, leading to greatly improved statistics (32) . To exploit this advantage for biological membranes as well, we have developed supported planar plasma membranes (SPPMs) for single-particle fusion studies (Fig. 5A ). Our strategy for preparing SPPMs is to fuse GPMVs onto polymer-supported lipid monolayers that have been transferred from a Langmuir trough (33) , which is different from previous methods (34) and preferentially orients membrane receptors with their binding sites accessible from solution. Similar to plain supported lipid bilayers (26, 35) , SPPMs prepared in this fashion display micrometersized domains, in which raft and nonraft lipid components are laterally mobile ( fig. S8 ). In agreement with the observations with GPMVs, the overlay of CD4 and CCR5 images in SPPMs shows that CD4 was substantially associated with Lo domains, whereas CCR5 was preferentially located at the edges of the domains (Fig. 5B and fig. S9 ). We observed by TIRF microscopy that single HIV Env particles bound predominantly to domain boundaries, whereas most VSV-G particles bound to Ld phases on SPPMs (Fig. 5 , C and D). In addition, these experiments recapitulate the observation made with GPMVs that the location of HIV binding to SPPMs is determined primarily by the location of the receptor and co-receptor in these membranes and not by the lipid phases (Fig. 5E ).
We observed large numbers of single-membrane fusion events of HIV Env particles with SPPMs ( Fig. 5F and movie S9) and classified them as docking, hemifusion, or full fusion (Fig. 5G) in Lo, Ld, and Lo/Ld compartments of the SPPM. We observed no direct full fusion and very little hemifusion in Ld phases and only 11 ± 3% direct full fusion and 13 ± 4% hemifusion of HIV virions in the Lo phase domains (Fig. 5H ). In contrast, HIV virions fused very efficiently (56 ± 3% of all particles) at the Lo/Ld domain boundaries and an additional 9 ± 4% hemifused in these locations (Fig. 5H ). These results are qualitatively similar to but quantitatively more robust than those obtained in GPMVs and therefore validate SPPMs as a useful additional system to quantitatively analyze fusion in heterogeneous biological membranes at the single-particle level.
Membrane fusion in HIV entry is a highly cooperative process that must overcome several energy barriers associated with different fusion intermediates. This energy must be provided and released at the right time and at the right place to drive the merger between the viral and target membranes. Although cholesterol-rich lipid domains have been implicated in cell entry, their proposed involvement was puzzling because ordered lipids are thought to be detrimental to membrane bending and fusion. However, we recently discovered that Lo/Ld phase boundaries facilitate fusion in model systems and demonstrated that line tension at these boundaries might provide an additional previously unrecognized driving force for fusion (23) . This previous work was limited because no receptors or co-receptors were present and because it could be argued that pure lipid model membranes oversimplify biological membranes. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated in this work that a very similar mechanism governs HIV fusion with biological host membranes containing its natural receptors. We directly observed that lipid domain boundaries are the portals for HIV binding and membrane fusion, presumably because they present the weakest points in the host membrane. On the basis of these results, we propose the following model: HIV gp120 binds to CD4 receptors located in cholesterol-rich lipid domains, which exist transiently in the plasma membranes of living cells. If located near CCR5 co-receptors at domain boundaries, this initial binding leads to structural changes of gp120 and binding to the CCR5 co-receptor, enriching bound virions at the boundaries (Fig. 6A) . After CD4 and CCR5 binding, gp41 changes its conformation to expose the fusion peptide to lipids in the boundary region (16) . The predisposed preference of CCR5 for membrane domain boundaries greatly facilitates the targeting of the fusion peptide to these same fusion-promoting areas of the host membrane. Although we did not examine the other HIV co-receptor, CXCR4, in this study, it might function equivalently to CCR5 in recruiting virions to domain boundary regions for more efficient fusion. Because receptors cooperate with membrane domain boundaries to form HIV entry sites, it would be interesting to examine in future studies the binding and fusion efficiencies of HIV particles with GPMVs or SPPMs, where CD4 and CCR5 are distributed differently or randomly.
In contrast to many other enveloped viruses, HIV displays only a few (~14) trimeric glycoprotein spikes on its envelope (36) . This small number is certainly inefficient for HIV entry and fusion. However, the cooperativity of HIV recognition and fusion at membrane domain boundaries may be a unique way to overcome this deficiency and may provide enough energy to drive fusion through its transition states with low Env copy numbers. Just as in the model systems (23) , line tension at the boundary likely serves as an additional driving force for fusion. It is well known that CD4 + T cells play a central role in the immune response following T cell antigen receptor engagement, which triggers T cell activation and proliferation against invading pathogens (37, 38) . T cell activation elicits the recruitment of a number of proteins to ordered lipid regions (39) and results in the formation of larger membrane domains, which can be exploited by HIV to facilitate entry (Fig. 6, B and C) . HIV exhibits infection at a much lower frequency in naïve CD4 + T cells than in activated CD4 + T cells (40, 41) , suggesting that HIV infection may be associated with the coalescence of cholesterol-rich lipid domains. Just as in model systems, we have shown here that line tension may also be a dominant force that promotes membrane fusion in biological membranes. The boundaries of the larger lipid domains in activated T cells could contribute to the elevated fusogenic capacity of activated T cells versus resting T cells. It is possible that activation of the immune system against other invading pathogens makes the cells more prone to HIV entry through the described mechanism. Therefore, enhanced domain activation could lead to an elevated production of HIV in people infected by other pathogens and thus an acceleration of the progression of AIDS (Fig. 6D) .
Finally, this work also showed that GPMVs and a novel procedure to produce supported planar GPMV-derived membranes that we call SPPMs are very useful to study the selected targeting and membrane fusion of HIV virions. We anticipate that these methods will also be useful to study the binding, fusion, and properties of many other particles on cell-derived plasma membranes. The new approaches are versatile and should lead to many new discoveries regarding the role of lipid and protein heterogeneity of cell membranes. They may also serve as novel platforms for screening of viral entry inhibitors. 
Most lipids and fluorescent probes were from Avanti Polar Lipids, and DiO, DiI, DiD, and octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) were from Invitrogen. MbCD, NEM, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Alexa 647-, or Alexa 555-labeled CTxB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Formaldehyde and DTT were purchased from Avantor and RPI, respectively. Alexa 488-labeled CD4 antibody and Alexa 647labeled CCR5 antibody were purchased from Novus Biologicals. HIV entry inhibitors (maraviroc and enfuvirtide), SCDase, and PLA2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HIV fusion peptide was custom-synthesized by the Yale W.M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory.
HIV pseudovirus production HIV Env particles pseudotyped with envelope gp160 protein and containing MLV core proteins were prepared by cotransfection of 293T cells with 3 mg of pFB-Luc (MLV vector plasmid), 2 mg of pHIT60 (packaging construct), 1 mg of MLV mKO-Gag, and 3 mg of HIV JRFL Env plasmids using the PolyFect reagent (Qiagen) (16) . The viruscontaining medium was collected at 48 hours after transfection and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to clear debris. To prepare DiD-labeled HIV particles, 293T medium was replaced with Opti-MEM I (Gibco Life Technologies) containing 10 mM DiD at 16 to 20 hours after transfection. After 4 hours of incubation at 37°C, unincorporated dye was removed by washing, and cells were returned to regular growth medium. After 24 hours of incubation, the extracellular medium was collected, centrifuged at low speed to remove cell debris, filtered through a 0.45-mm syringe filter, and stored at −80°C until use. For control experiments, MLVs pseudotyped with VSV-G and MLV core proteins were also prepared. For bulk binding and lipid mixing assays, membranes of viral particles were labeled with 20 ml of octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (1 mg/ml; R18) in 50 ml of virus for 60 min at room temperature and then free R18 was removed on a Sephadex PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The infectious titer was determined by a luciferase assay, as previously described (42) , in CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells for HIV Env pseudotyped viruses.
Preparation of GPMVs derived from CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells were provided by D. M. Rekosh (University of Virginia). GPMVs were produced and isolated from the cells, as previously described (17, 18) , with slight modifications. Briefly, CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), G418 (0.2 mg/ml), 1% penicillinstreptomycin (PenStrep), and puromycin (1 mg/ml) in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Plain (CD4 − /CCR5 − ) HeLa cells, which lack CD4 and CCR5, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, and 1% PenStrep in the same incubator. After growing the cells to a confluence of 70 to 90% in culture dishes, cells were washed three times with blebbing buffer [10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl 2 (pH 7.4)]. Membrane vesiculation was then induced by adding 25 mM formaldehyde and 2 mM DTT or 2 mM NEM in Ordered membrane domains in resting T cell plasma membranes are nanoscopic and short-lived, but small dynamic domains can coalesce to create larger ones to function as signaling platforms upon pathogen invasion. Helper CD4 + T cells recognize the pathogen-derived antigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and become activated by coalescence of membrane domains. The activation of CD4 + T cells stimulates the ability of B cells and CD8 + T cells to defend against the invading pathogens. In this model, we propose that CD4 + T cells that are challenged by pathogens are more prone to HIV infection than resting T cells, as indicated by the red arrows. The HIV infection leads to apoptotic T cell death and ultimately results in the progression to AIDS.
blebbing buffer for 1 hour at 37°C. Following shaking, solutions containing cell-detached GPMVs were gently decanted into a 50-ml tube. The GPMVs were placed on ice for 30 min to settle relatively large GPMVs (~10 mm in diameter), which were then transferred from the bottom of the tube to coverslips for observation on an epifluorescence microscope.
Lateral distribution and relative amount of CD4 and CCR5 on GPMVs We observed the lateral distributions of CD4 and CCR5 on cell-attached and isolated GPMVs. For the preparation of cell-attached GPMVs, CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells were seeded on quartz slides or 18-mm glass coverslips and grown to about 40% confluence. After inducing GPMVs from the cells, as described above, they were rinsed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove GPMVinducing chemicals. Cell-attached GPMVs or isolated GPMVs were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then the vesicles were stained with the Ld marker DiI (0.2 mM) or DiO (0.5 mM) and/or the Lo marker Alexa 555-conjugated CTxB (1 mg/ml) for 60 min on ice. After labeling, the GPMVs were incubated with an anti-CD4 antibody and/or an anti-CCR5 antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 and/or Alexa 647, respectively, at a concentration of 5 mg/ml at 4°C for 60 min. The lateral distribution of fluorescent lipids and proteins on cells or GPMVs was visualized using an epifluorescence microscope. The immunofluorescence staining was also used to evaluate the amount of CD4 and CCR5 on the surface of GPMVs. For quantification, isolated GPMVs were incubated with antibodies at 4°C for 60 min and then unbound antibodies were removed by centrifugation (16,000g) for 30 min at 4°C. GPMV pellets were resuspended in 400 ml of Hepes buffer. Relative amounts of CD4 and CCR5 were measured at room temperature by fluorescence emission intensities of Alexa 488 at 520 nm and Alexa 647 at 667 nm in a Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin-Yvon) with excitation wavelength at 495 and 650 nm, respectively. GPMVs from CD4 − /CCR5 − HeLa cells were used as negative controls and displayed only low or negligible fluorescence intensity.
Single and bulk binding assay of HIV Env particles to GPMVs For the binding of single HIV Env particles to GPMVs, GPMVs were induced from CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells on quartz or glass slides. After staining with DiO or 7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD)-DOPE, GPMVs were rinsed with buffer in a fabricated flow-through chamber. HIV particles labeled with mKO (mKO-Gag) were injected into the chamber containing the cell-attached or isolated GPMVs and incubated at 4°C for 60 min. Binding of the particles to GPMVs was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy for binding sites of virions, and the number of virions bound to GPMVs was counted for binding efficiency. Binding sites of VSV-G Env particles on GPMVs were also performed for control experiments. To quantify bulk binding efficiency of HIV, R18labeled viral particles were added to GPMVs labeled in a tube with NBD-DOPE and incubated at 4°C for 60 min. Unbound particles were removed by centrifugation (16,000g) for 30 min at 4°C. The pellets containing virus-bound GPMVs were resuspended in 400 ml of 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Fluorescence emission intensities of R18 at 590 nm and NBD at 535 nm were recorded at room temperature in a Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin-Yvon) with excitation wavelength at 560 and 460 nm, respectively. The ratio of fluorescence intensity at 590 nm/535 nm was used to measure relative binding efficiencies of HIV Env particles to GPMVs.
Fusion between R18-labeled virus particles and unlabeled GPMVs was measured by the dequenching of R18 fluorescence. Unlabeled GPMVs were added to the R18-labeled virions (1 × 10 8 particles) in Hepes buffer at room temperature. Concentration of GPMVs was estimated by total protein concentration in GPMVs using a bicinchoninic acid assay. Protein concentrations of GPMVs derived from CD4 + /CCR5 + , MbCD-treated CD4 + /CCR5 + , and plain CD4 − /CCR5 − HeLa cells were 101, 87, and 62 mg/ml, respectively. Fluorescence intensities were measured under constant stirring using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin-Yvon) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 555 and 590 nm, respectively. Dequenching of R18 fluorescence was normalized to the initial fluorescence (F/F 0 ).
To prepare the samples for electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM), HIV Env particles were incubated with GPMVs for 60 s at room temperature to capture early stages of membrane fusion between HIV particles and GPMVs. Samples (~3.5 ml) were applied to either c-flat or quantifoil holey carbon grids, manually bl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The grids were then transferred under liquid nitrogen to a Tecnai F20 cyroEM (Philips/FEI) operating at 120 kV. Images were recorded at magnifications of ×11,000 or ×30,000 under low-electron dose conditions (~20 e − /Å 2 ) using a 4k × 4k chargecoupled device (CCD) camera (Gatan).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For cholesterol depletion, isolated GPMVs from CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells were incubated with 5 mM MbCD in Hepes buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Other GPMVs were incubated with 5 mM lysoSM or 20 mM lysoPC in Hepes buffer for 30 min at room temperature to examine the effect of lysolipids on lipid phases. Yet, other GPMVs were added to 10 U of PLA2 in 10 mM tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) or 10 mU of SCDase in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0), which was adjusted to an osmolality of 300 mmol/kg by the addition of NaCl, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation, GPMVs were isolated by centrifugation (16,000g) for 30 min at 4°C and were used for measurements of HIV binding and fusion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fluorescence images were recorded on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a mercury lamp as a light source, 40× or 63× water immersion objectives (Carl Zeiss; numerical aperture, 0.95), and an electron-multiplying CCD cooled to −70°C (iXon DV887ESC-BV, Andor) as a detector. Images were acquired using homemade software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments). Membranes stained with DiO or NBD were epi-illuminated through a 480-nm band-pass filter (D480/30, Chroma) and via a dichroic mirror (505dclp, Chroma). Fluorescence was observed through a 535-nm band-pass filter (D535/40, Chroma). DiI-or rhodamine-stained membranes and mKO-labeled viral particles were epi-illuminated through a 540-nm band-pass filter (D540/25, Chroma) and via a dichroic mirror (565dclp, Chroma). Fluorescence was observed through a 605-nm band-pass filter (D605/55, Chroma). Viral particles or LUVs stained with DiD were illuminated through a 620-nm band-pass filter (ET620/60, Chroma) and observed through a 665-nm band-pass filter (HQ665/60, Chroma). All fluorescence imaging was performed at room temperature (~22°C). Images were processed and assessed for colocalization using ImageJ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GUVs were prepared via the electroformation technique. Briefly, 25 ml of a 10 mM lipid mixture composed of bSM/bPC/bPS/cholesterol (2:1:1:1) containing the fluorescent lipid probe Rh-PE [0.1 mole percent (mol %)] was deposited on the conducting surfaces of two indium tin oxide-coated glass slides. After the slides were placed in a vacuum desiccator for 90 min to remove residual solvent, a fabricated chamber composed of two conducting slides facing each other separated by a 0.5-mm spacer was filled with 300 mM sucrose in H 2 O. GUVs were generated by applying alternating electric current (3 V, 10 Hz) through a function generator for 120 min at 60°C and transferred into a 300 mM glucose solution to settle by gravity on the microscope slide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lipid mixing of LUVs mediated by HIV fusion peptide LUVs were prepared by extrusion. Phospholipids composed of bSM/ bPC/bPS/cholesterol (2:1:1:1) were dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and methanol, and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas in a glass test tube. The thin lipid film was further dried overnight under vacuum and hydrated with 0.5 ml of Hepes buffer [10 mM Hepes and 120 mM NaCl (pH 7.2)]. The suspension was vigorously vortexed for 5 min, was subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles, and was then extruded 21 times through two stacked polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 100 nm (Avestin). The lipid mixing assay was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer between NBD-PE and rhodamine-PE. The HIV fusion peptide was added to 50 mM LUVs with a ratio of 1:9 of labeled (1 mol % of NBD-PE and rhodamine-PE each) to unlabeled LUVs in Hepes buffer at room temperature. The fluorescence was recorded under constant stirring in a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin-Yvon) with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 460 and 535 nm, respectively. The value for 0% lipid mixing was the fluorescence intensity of the LUV suspension before the fusion peptide was added, whereas the value for 100% lipid mixing was obtained by adding Triton X-100 [final concentration, 0.5% (v/v)] to the suspension at the end of each experiment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quartz slides were cleaned by boiling in Contrad detergent for 15 min and by sonication in a hot bath for 30 min. After rinsing with deionized water and ethanol, the slides were immersed in Piranha solution (3:1 mixture of 95% sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide) to remove remaining organic residues, followed by extensive rinsing in pure water. The first leaflet of the SPPM was prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer directly onto the quartz slide. Lipid mixtures composed of bSM/ bPC/cholesterol (2:2:1) with 3 mol % of DMPE (1,2-dimyristoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine)-polyethyleneglycol-triethoxysilane (43) were spread onto a pure water surface in a NIMA 611 LB trough (KSV NIMA). After allowing the solvent to evaporate for 10 min, the monolayer was compressed at a rate of 10 cm 2 /min to reach a surface pressure of 32 mN/m. Immediately before use, quartz slides were further cleaned for 10 min in an argon plasma sterilizer (Harrick Scientific) and then dipped into the trough at a speed of 200 mm/min and withdrawn at 5 mm/min while keeping the monolayer surface pressure constant at 32 mN/m. The transferred lipid monolayer was dried in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature overnight and cured in a 70°C oven for 40 min to covalently link the polymer to the SiO 2 slide surface. After equilibration in the desiccator to room temperature, the slide with the tethered polymer-supported LB monolayer was placed in a custombuilt flow-through chamber. A suspension of GPMVs in Hepes buffer was injected into the chamber and incubated for at least 2 hours at room temperature to form the distal leaflet of the SPPM bilayer. Excess unfused GPMVs were then washed out by extensive rinsing with Hepes buffer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The integrity of the SPPMs and the diffusion of the lipids within them were examined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Bilayers were bleached in a pattern of parallel stripes, and the data were fit to the model F(t) = F ∞ + (F 0 − F ∞ )exp(−Da 2 t), where F 0 and F ∞ are the initial and final fluorescence intensities after bleaching, respectively, a = 2p/p, p is the stripe period (12.7 or 3.2 mm), and D is the lateral diffusion coefficient. The mobile fraction (mf), which reflects the percentage of observed fluorescence recovery within the time frame of a FRAP experiment (<1 min), is given by mf ¼ F∞ÀF0 F pre ÀF 0 Â 200, where F pre is the fluorescence intensity before photobleaching. Ten regions on three independently prepared bilayers were sampled to determine the reported average values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Binding and fusion of single HIV Env particles on SPPMs by TIRF microscopy To measure binding to SPPMs, mKO-labeled (mKO-Gag) HIV Env particles were injected into a chamber with unlabeled SPPMs, and the fluorescence increase by HIV binding to SPPMs was monitored over time by prism-based TIRF microscopy. The prism-quartz interface was lubricated with glycerol to allow easy translocation of the sample cell on the microscope stage. The light source was an argon ion laser (Innova 90C, Coherent) emitting light at 514 nm, and fluorescence was observed through a 610-nm band-pass filter (D610/60, Chroma). The beam was totally internally reflected at an angle of 72°from the normal to produce an evanescent wave. The intensity of the laser beam was computer-controlled through an acousto-optic modulator (Isomet) or could be blocked entirely by a computer-controlled shutter. The laser intensity, shutter, and camera were controlled by a homemade program written in LabVIEW (National Instruments). To investigate the targeting of HIV particles to different regions of Ld/Lo phase-separated SPPMs, mKO-labeled particles were incubated with SPPMs that were stained with DiO for 60 min at room temperature. After unbound particles were washed away with Hepes buffer, phase-separated SPPMs were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy, and bound particles were visualized by TIRF microscopy. To analyze and quantify the distribution of SPPM-bound particles, we distinguished three regions of the SPPM: Lo domains, Ld phase areas, and Lo/Ld boundary regions with a 0.75-mm width centered on the perimeter of each Lo domain. Custom-built particle-tracking software (35) was used to automatically detect the position (x and y coordinates) of each particle. To monitor the fusion of single HIV particles with the SPPM, DiD-labeled HIV Env particles were injected into a chamber, one large window wall of which was formed by the SPPM. The light source for TIRF illumination was a diode laser (CUBE640, Coherent) to excite the lipid dye DiD through a 620-nm filter (ET620/60, Chroma) and via a dichroic mirror (660dclp, Chroma). DiD fluorescence was observed through a 665-nm band-pass filter (HQ665/60, Chroma). Data acquisition and image analysis were accomplished through custom-built software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) (35) . Single events that included docking, hemifusion, and full fusion were measured by analyzing the peak fluorescence intensities from each bound particle as a function of time: Events with no fluorescence change over time were classified as docking, those with decays to around one-half of the original peak intensity were classified as hemifusion, and those with complete decays were classified as direct full fusion events (44) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

55,9104c8bed3340e783a7a0a820ff269711f39bc8f,"A 62-year-old man presented to our hospital for the further evaluation and treatment of his back pain, general fatigue, and dyspnea, which had developed 4 days after the 29th administration of nivolumab to treat his lung cancer. Based on his clinical history, elevated serum cardiac enzyme values, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and myocardial biopsy findings, he was diagnosed with myocarditis induced by nivolumab. Corticosteroid therapy improved his condition, and CMR performed on hospital day 11 also showed remarkable improvement. Although nivolumab-induced myocarditis is rare, cardiologists should consider it when encountering patients treated with such a drug for malignant disease.","Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) that has become a new treatment option for malignant tumors. While initially proven effective for melanoma, the diseases for which this agent is administered have been expanding. However, a number of immune-related adverse events (ir-AEs), which are rarely seen in conventional chemotherapy, have been reported with this drug, and as the frequency of its use increases, there are concerns that the number of side effects will also increase.
We experienced a case of myocarditis induced by nivolumab. To our knowledge, only 13 such cases have been reported (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . In this case, the onset was delayed until one year after the introduction of nivolumab, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) findings were useful for its differentiation from viral myocarditis. We report this case and review the literature.
A 62-year-old man with an unresectable lung adenocarcinoma of clinical stage cT1bN2M0 of the Eighth Lung Cancer Stage Classification (13) diagnosed in August 2013 presented to Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center complaining of back pain, chest discomfort, general fatigue, and dyspnea in September 2018 and was admitted for a further evaluation. Because of mild fibrosis for which the possibility of interstitial lung diseases on CT could not be ruled out, he had been receiving chemotherapy without radiation therapy since the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Since September 2013, he had undergone chemotherapy with cisplatin plus pemetrexed followed by maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed and docetaxel. In May 2017, because the contralateral mediastinal lymph node was enlarged, recurrence was diagnosed, and nivolumab was started biweekly. The swollen lymph nodes decreased in size, and no abnormal shadows were noted, so he was considered to be in complete remission. In November 2017, decreased FT3 and FT4 values and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone value indicating hypothyroidism were found, but there were no clinical symptoms, and we followed him without treatment. In July 2018, he developed general fatigue, and we considered the symptoms due to hypothyroidism and stopped the nivolumab. By August 2018, his general fatigue had improved, and we restarted the nivolumab. However, in September 2018, 4 days after the 29th administration of nivolumab, he developed back pain, chest discomfort, general fatigue, and dyspnea. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 92/62 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 20/min. Chest auscultation revealed an irregular heartbeat without murmurs or rales. Pitting edema was found in his lower extremities. The electrocardiogram showed wide QRS waves (Fig. 1A) . A transthoracic cardiac ultrasound examination showed an attenuated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% compared with that of 70% in February 2014 and a decrease in the left ventricular wall motion in the posterior, inferior, and lateral walls. Laboratory data showed white blood cells of 6,200/mm 3 , hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL, platelets of 205,000/mm 3 , serum creatine kinase value of 970 IU/ L (normal 56 to 244), and increases in creatine kinasemyocardial band to 78 ng/mL (normal <5 ng/mL) and cardiac troponin T to 4.81 ng/mL (normal <0.1 ng/mL). The Creactive protein value was also increased to 2.06 mg/dL. Autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies, anti-Acl-70 antibodies, anti-ARS antibodies, anti-ds DNA antibodies, anti-RNP antibodies, anti-SS-A/Ro, and anti-SS-B/La antibodies, were all negative. BNP was increased to 466 pg/mL, and chest X-ray showed cardiac enlargement with rightsided pleural effusion (Fig. 1B) .
We initially suspected acute myocardial infarction, and a Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted to assist in management in the intensive care unit. The pulmonary artery pressure [systolic/diastolic (mean)] was 28/19 (23) mmHg. Emergency coronary angiography was performed, but no significant stenosis of the coronary arteries was found. We also performed various CMR examinations (Fig. 2) . Cine images showed diffuse moderately reduced wall motion abnormality with mild wall hypertrophy, and T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) black-blood (BB) (T2w-STIR-BB) imaging showed diffuse high signal intensity (SI) equal to or greater than the spleen SI. Early gadolinium-enhanced (EGE) imaging showed diffuse hyper-enhancement of the myocardium, and late gadolinium-enhanced imaging showed diffuse patchy enhancement. Given the above findings, we diagnosed him with myocarditis with diffuse myocardial edema.
We performed a myocardial biopsy from the endocardial side of the left ventricle. The biopsy revealed fibrosis of the myocardial tissue, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and T cell-dominant lymphocyte infiltration, which were consistent with lymphocytic myocarditis (Fig. 3 ). Viral PCR testing using myocardial specimens for influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, corona virus, parainfluenza virus, bocavirus, echovirus, coxsackie virus echovirus, and enterovirus were all negative. Serum antibodies measured in the convalescent phase against echovirus, coxsackie virus, enterovirus, adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus were not increased compared with those measured in the acute phase. We subsequently considered nivolumab-induced myocarditis. We also detected transient complete atrioventricular block during the myocardial biopsy and inserted a temporary pacemaker. Because of these new findings, we diagnosed the patient with nivolumab-induced myocarditis and started administration of methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days.
From hospital day 4, the internal corticosteroid dose (prednisolone) was reduced to 60 mg daily (1 mg/kg). The patient's condition subsequently improved. His serum creatine kinase value decreased to the normal range within a week after admission. The ejection fraction measured by the transthoracic cardiac ultrasound examination performed on hospital day 9 improved to 55%, and asynergy of the car- diac wall also improved. Electrocardiography performed on hospital day 10 showed narrowing of the QRS. CMR imaging was performed on hospital day 11 and one month following the start of methylprednisolone administration. Cine images showed gradual improvement of the wall motion abnormality with recovery of the left ventricular ejection fraction. T2w-STIR-BB and EGE images showed improvement of edema findings, and late gadolinium enhancement of the myocardium was decreased. The patient was discharged on hospital day 19. After discharge, the corticosteroid dose was gradually tapered (prednisolone 60 mg daily for 1 week, 50 mg daily for 2 weeks, 40 mg daily for 2 weeks, and 30 mg daily thereafter), and he has been regularly followed up on an outpatient basis. He continues to take prednisolone 30 mg daily, and his myocarditis has not recurred.
We herein report a case of nivolumab-induced myocarditis that developed one year after its administration. A cardiac muscle biopsy specimen showed T cell-dominant lymphocyte infiltration, which was successfully improved by corticosteroid therapy.
As an ICI, nivolumab is a novel remedy for malignant tumors that promotes the attack of cancer cells by lymphocytes by suppressing the expression of PD-1 on the cell surface of cancer cells. Nivolumab has transformed the treatment of several cancers by releasing restrained antitumor immune responses (14) . Treatment with nivolumab is known to cause several ir-AEs, including thyroid dysfunction, colitis, pneumonitis, and rarely, type 1 diabetes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. However, the frequency of myocarditis is 0.06% (8), whereas the frequencies of myocarditis due to other ICIs, such as pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, in Japan are reported to be 3 in 4,259 patients (0.07%) (15) and 2 in 2,800 patients (0.07%) (16), respectively. Although its probability of occurrence is not high, myocarditis is an ir-AE that cannot be ignored due to the possibility of a fatal outcome. To our knowledge, only 13 cases of myocarditis induced by nivolumab have been reported (Table) . Among these 13 cases, the patients' ages ranged from 49 to 80 years, and 9 men were included. Malignancies for which nivolumab was administered included melanoma in eight cases, lung cancer in four cases, and glioblastoma in one case. Development of nivolumabinduced myocarditis occurred after the initial administration of nivolumab in five cases, after the second administration in three cases, after the third administration in three cases, after the ninth administration in one case, and after the tenth administration in one case. Our patient developed myocarditis one year after the initiation of nivolumab but during the third readministration after a two-month period of drug cessation due to hypothyroidism. As our case indicates, nivolumab-induced myocarditis can develop even one year after its administration. Thus, clinicians should consider nivolumab as a cause of myocarditis even if one year has passed from its introduction.
Nine of the 13 patients underwent a myocardial biopsy or autopsy (2, (4) (5) (6) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . All patients had myocardial tissue fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and T cell-dominant lymphocyte infiltration, findings that were also found in our patient. From previous reports, the characteristic histological finding of nivolumab-induced myocarditis is T-cell inflammation. Four potential mechanisms of ir-AE have been proposed (17) . First, ICIs (monoclonal antibodies) binding directly to cell surface proteins, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), which is expressed on normal tissues, can cause T-cell infiltration and injury to tissues due to complement mediation. Second, circulating T cells that rec-ognize antigens expressed by tumor cells can identify either the same tumor antigen or a homologous tissue antigen in healthy tissue. ICI therapy that inhibits programmed cell death protein 1 or CTLA4 can stimulate recognition of or binding of T cells to antigens expressed by non-target organs. Third, there is some evidence to suggest that inhibiting immune checkpoint molecules can increase circulating cytokine levels in affected tissues, thus helping inflammatory molecules infiltrate non-target tissues. Fourth, antibodies administered against ICIs may increase autoantibody levels against target organs or stimulate new autoantibody formation.
CMR was performed in 5 of the 13 cases and showed varied patterns, including diffuse contrast effect, local contrast effect, and normal findings (1, (5) (6) (7) 10) . The further accumulation of CMR findings of nivolumab-induced myocarditis is needed in order to better determine the characteristic findings of such cases. However, CMR was useful in our case for ruling out viral myocarditis as a cause because viral myocarditis usually affects the epicardium, as reflected by its hematogenous spread (18) , whereas our patient showed a diffuse myocardial distribution. CMR may be useful for differentiating viral myocarditis from other disease entities.
Considering the mechanism underlying the side effects of ICIs as described above, steroids are often administered to counteract serious ir-AEs (16) . In our patient, in addition to heart failure, complete atrioventricular block developed, and it was necessary to administer a steroid. Among the 13 cases reported so far, none of the patients underwent observation without treatment. The recently published clinical practice guidelines state that all ICI patients complicated with myocarditis should be treated with corticosteroids regardless, of the grade of cardiac toxicities (19) . The therapeutic options in the 13 reported cases include prednisolone in 5, methylprednisolone in 4, mycophenolate mofetil in 1, methylprednisolone and infliximab in 1, methylprednisolone and intravenous anti-thymus immunoglobulin in 1, and no mention of therapy in 1 case. Corticosteroid therapy seems effective in most cases, but deaths in patients treated with steroid therapy have also been reported (3). One patient with recurrence of myocarditis after nivolumab readministration eventually died; we therefore consider that nivolumab should not be readministered in such cases (5) .
In conclusion, we experienced a case of nivolumabinduced myocarditis successfully treated with steroid therapy. We evaluated the CMR findings in the acute phase and after discharge. Although reports of nivolumab-induced myocarditis are limited, myocarditis is a life-threatening adverse event, and clinicians should consider it in the differential diagnosis when it is encountered in patients treated with nivolumab.

57,db4a4b2bde1bf1bb981bf87f9c6c25462834a25e,"Intracellular vesicle fusion is mediated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. It is generally accepted that membrane fusion occurs when the vesicle and target membranes are brought into close proximity by SNAREs and SM proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that, for fusion to occur, membrane bilayers must be destabilized by a conserved membrane-embedded motif located at the juxtamembrane region of the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE. Comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues, the juxtamembrane motif perturbs the lipid bilayer structure and promotes SNARE-SMmediated membrane fusion. The juxtamembrane motif can be functionally substituted with an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction. These findings establish the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE as a membrane-destabilizing peptide. Requirement of membrane-destabilizing peptides is likely a common feature of biological membrane fusion.
This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).","Membrane fusion-the merging of two lipid bilayers into one-involves substantial membrane remodeling and lipid rearrangements, imposing a high energy barrier that must be overcome by specialized membrane fusion proteins Martens and McMahon, 2008; Südhof and Rothman, 2009 ). An extensively studied form of membrane fusion is the merging of intracellular vesicles with their target membranes, which transports cargo proteins between organelles in the endomembrane system (Baker and Hughson, 2016; Brunger et al., 2009; Ohya et al., 2009; Wickner, 2010) . Intracellular vesicle fusion is driven by two conserved families of molecules: SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and SM (Sec1/Munc18) proteins (Rizo and Südhof, 2012; Shen et al., 2007) . The vesicle-anchored v-SNARE pairs with the target membraneassociated t-SNAREs to form a four-helix trans-SNARE complex, forcing the two ensures SNARE pairing specificity (Baker et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2018) .
Theoretical modeling suggests that, to overcome the energy barrier of membrane fusion, the lipid bilayer structure must be disrupted after the two membranes are brought into close proximity (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008; Kozlov et al., 2010; Risselada and Grubmüller, 2012) . In viral fusion, another type of extensively studied membrane fusion, viral fusion proteins possess membrane-destabilizing peptides required for the fusion of enveloped viruses with host cell membranes (Earp et al., 2005; Harrison, 2008) . Virus-anchored fusion proteins bring the viral limiting membrane and the host cell membrane (the plasma membrane or the endosome) into close apposition as they refold between the membrane bilayers, analogous to the role of the trans-SNARE complex in intracellular vesicle fusion (Chlanda et al., 2016; Harrison, 2008; Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007; Martens and McMahon, 2008; Top et al., 2005) . Viral fusion proteins use fusion peptides to anchor the virus to the host cell (Harrison, 2008) . Interestingly, in addition to their membrane-anchoring function, fusion peptides can directly destabilize lipid bilayers to promote viral membrane fusion (Düzgüneş and Shavnin, 1992; Earp et al., 2005; Epand, 2003; Haldar et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2004; Shmulevitz et al., 2004) . Besides fusion peptides, the membrane-proximal external regions of viral fusion proteins can also destabilize membrane bilayers (Allison et al., 1999; Buzon et al., 2010; Howard et al., 2008; Jeetendra et al., 2003; Muñoz-Barroso et al., 1999; Vishwanathan and Hunter, 2008) . More recently, membrane-destabilizing peptides were also discovered in non-viral fusion proteins such as atlastins, which drive homotypic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fusion (Faust et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2012) .
Membrane-destabilizing peptides have not been known to exist in the SNARE-SM vesicle fusion machinery, raising the possibility that intracellular vesicle fusion might proceed through a route distinct from other membrane fusion pathways. In this work, we discovered that the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE directly perturbs the lipid bilayer structure in a manner reminiscent of viral fusion proteins. Mutations of the juxtamembrane motif abrogate SNARE-SM-mediated fusion in vitro, correlating with the essential role of the juxtamembrane motif in vesicle fusion in the cell. Importantly, the juxtamembrane motif can be functionally replaced by an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in membrane fusion. Thus, intracellular vesicle fusion also requires a membrane-destabilizing peptide, supporting the notion that membrane-destabilizing peptides constitute a universal element in membrane fusion reactions. These findings suggest that biological membrane fusion pathways, although driven by disparate fusion proteins, are governed by common underlying mechanisms.
Membrane-destabilizing peptides in viral fusion and homotypic ER fusion are usually short segments embedded in the surface of lipid bilayers (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003; Earp et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2012) . VAMP2/synaptobrevin, a v-SNARE involved in synaptic exocytosis (Martin et al., 2013; Söllner et al., 1993) , possesses a conserved juxtamembrane motif linking the force-generating SNARE motif to the transmembrane domain ( Figure 1A ; Bowen and Brunger, 2006; Brewer et al., 2011) . Buried in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer, the juxtamembrane motif contains hydrophobic residues that insert into the nonpolar phase of the lipid bilayer as well as basic residues localized to the polar phase of the membrane ( Figure 1B ; Bowen and Brunger, 2006; Brewer et al., 2011; Ellena et al., 2009; Kweon et al., 2003) . The juxtamembrane motif is critical for exocytosis in vivo (Borisovska et al.,2012; DeMill et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2009 ), but its role in the membrane fusion reaction has remained unclear.
To examine the function of the juxtamembrane motif in membrane fusion, synaptic exocytic SNAREs (syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VAMP2) and SM protein (Munc18-1) were reconstituted into a liposome fusion assay. The kinetics of the liposome fusion reactions were measured using lipid and content mixing assays (Yu et al., 2019) . The conserved residues of the juxtamembrane motif were mutated into alanines, and the VAMP2 mutant was reconstituted into proteoliposomes at the same density as the wild-type (WT) protein (Figures 2A, 2B , and S1A). We observed that the SNARE-Muncl8-1-mediated fusion reaction was strongly inhibited when the juxtamembrane motif was mutated (Figures 2C-2E, S1B, and S2). In contrast, the basal SNARE-driven fusion (without Munc18-1) was not affected by the mutation (Figures 2C-2E and S2). The selective involvement of the juxtamembrane motif in the SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated fusion reaction is consistent with the discovery that basal SNARE-driven fusion is fundamentally distinct from the SM protein-assisted fusion pathway (Baker et al., 2015; Jiao et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018) . The SNARE-SM-mediated fusion reaction, but not basal SNARE-driven fusion, recapitulates intracellular vesicle fusion Yu et al., 2015 Yu et al., , 2018 .
These results demonstrate that the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 is critical for SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated membrane fusion.
Next, we sought to define how the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 promotes membrane fusion at the molecular level. We first examined whether the juxtamembrane motif influences membrane docking. The t-SNARE liposomes were anchored to avidin beads and used to bind v-SNARE liposomes. Pairing of v-and t-SNAREs allowed the v-SNARE liposomes to dock onto the bead-anchored t-SNARE liposomes, which was moderately enhanced by Munc18-1 ( Figure 3A ). We observed that mutations of the VAMP2 juxtamembrane motif did not affect docking of the liposomes ( Figure 3A) . Hence, the juxtamembrane motif is not involved in the docking step of the membrane fusion reaction.
In a liposome co-flotation assay, WT and mutant VAMP2 bound equally well to the t-SNAREs ( Figure S3 ). Thus, the juxtamembrane motif is dispensable for SNARE complex assembly, consistent with the ability of the VAMP2 mutant to drive normal basal fusion ( Figures 2C and 2D ). Next, we examined whether the juxtamembrane motif regulates SNARE-Munc18-1 association. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we observed that the affinity of Munc18-1 binding to the WT SNARE complex was similar to its binding to the mutant SNARE complex in which the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 was mutated ( Figure 3B ). We then further examined SNARE-Munc18-1 binding using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. We observed that mutation of the juxtamembrane motif did not impair the interaction of GST-Munc18-1 with the SNARE complex ( Figure 3C ), in agreement with the ITC results. Thus, although selectively required for the SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated fusion reaction, the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 is dispensable for formation of the SNARE-Munc18-1 complex.
Together, these data demonstrate that the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 is dispensable for SNARE complex formation and SNARE-Munc18-1 association, supporting a model where it promotes membrane fusion through lipid binding.
The juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 is comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues that directly interact with lipids ( Figures 1B and 4A ; Bowen and Brunger, 2006; Brewer et al., 2011; Ellena et al., 2009; Han et al., 2016) . It has been speculated that electrostatic interactions between the basic residues and lipid head groups are involved in the vesicle fusion reaction (Montal, 1999; Williams et al., 2009) . Direct evidence for this model, however, has been lacking. Next, we examined the functional role of a conserved stretch of basic residues (K85/R86/K87) in the juxtamembrane motif ( Figure 4A ). We observed that SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion was strongly inhibited when the K85/R86/K87 (KRK) stretch was deleted or mutated into alanines ( Figure 4B ), indicating a critical role of these residues in the fusion reaction. We reasoned that, if the KRK stretch promotes membrane fusion through electrostatic interactions with lipids, then its activity should rely on the overall charge rather than specific amino acids. To test this possibility, the KRK sequence was substituted with triple lysines (KKK) or triple arginines (RRR) ( Figure  4A ), both of which retained the overall charge of the juxtamembrane motif. Indeed, VAMP2 variants bearing the KKK or RRR substitutions were fully active in mediating SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion ( Figure 4B ). We then replaced the KRK sequence with six histidine residues (His 6 ), which are weakly basic at pH 7.4 ( Figure 4A ). We found that the VAMP2 variant bearing the His 6 substitution also supported SNARE-Munc18-1mediated liposome fusion, albeit with a lower efficiency ( Figure 4B ), consistent with partial protonation of histidine side chains at neutral pH. By contrast, substitution of the KRK stretch with acidic residues (EDE) abrogated SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion ( Figure 4B ). None of these mutations significantly affected basal SNARE-driven fusion ( Figure 4B ), confirming the dispensability of the juxtamembrane motif in the basal fusion reaction. These data demonstrate that the function of the juxtamembrane motif in membrane fusion requires the basic residues.
The juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 also contains a hydrophobic stretch (residues 88-93) buried in the nonpolar phase of the membrane bilayer . We observed that SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion was strongly inhibited when this hydrophobic stretch was deleted or mutated into alanines ( Figure 4B ). Thus, like the basic residues, the hydrophobic stretch is critical for the function of the juxtamembrane motif in membrane fusion.
Together, these data demonstrate that both the basic and hydrophobic stretches are required for the function of the VAMP2 juxtamembrane motif in SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated membrane fusion. Because these regions are known to interact with lipids Brewer et al., 2011; Ellena et al., 2009) , our data further suggest that the juxtamembrane motif promotes membrane fusion by directly binding to the lipid bilayer.
Next, we sought to determine whether the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 directly influences the integrity of membrane bilayers. A synthetic peptide encompassing the VAMP2 juxtamembrane motif was added to protein-free liposomes ( Figure 5A ). Using a dequenching-based liposome leakage assay, we observed that the juxtamembrane motif peptide induced significant content release from the population of liposomes (Figures 5B and 5C) . In contrast, peptides derived from other SNARE sequences, including the Npeptide of syntaxin-1 and the Vc peptide of VAMP2, did not induce content release ( Figures  5B and 5C ). Because membrane disruption is often accompanied by lipid mixing (Bailey et al., 1997; Thorén et al., 2005) , we next examined whether the SNARE-derived peptides can induce liposome lipid mixing. Indeed, the juxtamembrane motif peptide, but not the Npeptide or Vc peptide, induced lipid mixing of protein-free liposomes ( Figure S4 ), correlating with the membrane-disrupting activity of the juxtamembrane motif peptide ( Figures 5B and 5C ). Next, we used negative staining electron microscopy to visualize the effect of the juxtamembrane motif peptide on liposome morphology. We observed that protrusions emanated from liposomes incubated with the juxtamembrane motif peptide but not the N-peptide or Vc peptide ( Figure 5D ), consistent with the ability of the juxtamembrane motif peptide to remodel membrane bilayers.
Thus, the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 is intrinsically capable of disrupting the lipid bilayer structure. These data strongly suggest that the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 promotes SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated membrane fusion by destabilizing the membrane bilayer.
We reasoned that, if the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 promotes membrane fusion by destabilizing the lipid bilayer, then it could be functionally substituted with an unrelated peptide known to disrupt the membrane structure. To test this possibility, the VAMP2 juxtamembrane motif was replaced with the TatP59W peptide, a variant of the Tat peptide derived from the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (Thorén et al., 2005) . Like the VAMP2 juxtamembrane motif, the TatP59W peptide is a short membraneembedded stretch comprised of both basic and hydrophobic residues ( Figure 6A ; Thorén et al., 2005) . Importantly, the TatP59W peptide exhibits no sequence similarity with the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 and is not involved in exocytosis ( Figure 6A ; Thorén et al., 2005) . We observed that, although mutations of the juxtamembrane motif abolished SNARE-Munc18-1 mediated liposome fusion, the fusion was restored when the TatP59W peptide was introduced into the juxtamembrane region of VAMP2 ( Figure 6B ). Thus, the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 can be replaced by an unrelated bilayer-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction, further demonstrating that the juxtamembrane motif promotes membrane fusion by destabilizing the lipid bilayer.
In all v-SNAREs, the SNARE motif is directly connected to the juxtamembrane motif without extra residues between them ( Figure 1A ). Insertions of flexible linkers between the SNARE and juxtamembrane motifs of VAMP2 strongly inhibit exocytosis in vivo (Deák et al., 2006; DeMill et al., 2014; Kesavan et al., 2007) . However, it was unclear whether and how the linker insertions directly influence the vesicle fusion reaction. Next, we introduced helix-breaking glycine and serine residues between the SNARE motif and juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 ( Figure 7A ). We observed that these linker insertions had little effect on the basal SNARE-driven liposome fusion reaction ( Figure 7B ). Insertion of 21 residues only moderately reduced the basal SNARE-driven liposome fusion, whereas shorter insertions had no effect on the fusion kinetics ( Figure 7B ). We then examined how the linker insertions affect the SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated fusion reaction. We found that insertion of two residues resulted in normal fusion kinetics ( Figure 7B ). However, further extension of the linker strongly inhibited SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion ( Figure 7B ). With seven or more helix-disrupting residues added, the liposome fusion reaction was essentially reduced to the basal level ( Figure 7B ), similar to mutations of the juxtamembrane motif (Figures 2 and 4) .
Thus, the SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated fusion reaction is highly sensitive to linker insertions, indicating that the membrane-destabilizing juxtamembrane motif must be directly connected to the force-generating SNARE motif with minimal spacing. Interestingly, in vivo exocytosis also tolerated a two-residue insertion but was abrogated when longer linkers were introduced ( Figure 7C ; Deák et al., 2006; Kesavan et al., 2007) . The strong correlation of our biochemical data with genetic observations further supports the physiological relevance of the membrane-destabilizing function uncovered in this work.
Although the cytoplasmic domains of SNAREs and their interactions with SM proteins have been well characterized, little has been known about protein-membrane interactions in the vesicle fusion reaction. In this work, we discovered that the membrane-embedded juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 promotes membrane fusion by destabilizing the lipid bilayer. This membrane-destabilizing function is supported by three lines of evidence: (1) mutations or deletions of the lipid-binding residues in the juxtamembrane motif inhibit SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated membrane fusion; (2) the juxtamembrane motif is intrinsically capable of disrupting lipid bilayer structures; and (3) an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide can replace the juxtamembrane motif in promoting membrane fusion. Because the juxtamembrane motif is conserved among v-SNAREs, we anticipate that its membranedestabilizing function is required for all vesicle fusion pathways. With the discovery of a membrane-destabilizing peptide in intracellular vesicle fusion, we suggest that biological membrane fusion pathways, although driven by disparate proteins, are governed by a common principle: assembly or refolding of membrane fusion proteins brings two lipid bilayers into close proximity, followed by local disruption of the bilayer structure by membrane-destabilizing peptides.
How does the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE destabilize the membrane bilayer? Electron microscopy (EM) imaging showed that the juxtamembrane motif deforms the membrane bilayer, which creates local elastic stresses and reduces the energy barrier for membrane merging McMahon et al., 2010) . Curvature induction usually requires the cooperative action of multiple copies of a membrane-binding molecule (Hui et al., 2009; McMahon et al., 2010) so that the juxtamembrane motif is unable to induce curvature within free v-SNAREs. When multiple SNARE complexes (three or more) zipper cooperatively in a vesicle fusion reaction (Domanska et al., 2009; Mohrmann et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2012) , it is conceivable that their juxtamembrane motifs are concentrated at the fusion sites, allowing curvature induction. This curvature-inducing activity can be recapitulated by adding high concentrations of synthetic juxtamembrane motif peptides ( Figure 5D ). The juxtamembrane peptide of the v-SNARE may also promote dehydration of lipid head groups, which disrupts membrane integrity and neutralizes negative lipid charges to reduce the repulsive force of approaching membranes Murray et al., 1999; Shintou et al., 2007; Tarafdar et al., 2015) . Interestingly, in the postfusion cis-SNARE complex, the juxtamembrane motif associates with the t-SNAREs , suggesting that the juxtamembrane motif is dislodged from the membrane during a late stage of the fusion reaction. It is conceivable that dislodging of the juxtamembrane motif further disrupts the membrane structure at the fusion sites. Before its ultimate pairing with the t-SNAREs, the dislodged juxtamembrane motif may also transiently bind and destabilize the target membrane in trans. Together, these membraneremodeling activities facilitate lipid rearrangements to form stalk and hemifusion intermediates, followed by opening and expansion of fusion pores controlled by SNARE transmembrane domains (Bao et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2015; Dhara et al., 2016; Fang and Lindau, 2014; Lindau et al., 2012; Ngatchou et al., 2010; Pieren et al., 2015) .
The juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE is dispensable for the basal SNARE-driven membrane fusion, again demonstrating that the basal fusion reaction differs fundamentally from SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion (Yu et al., , 2018 . Only the SNARE-SM-mediated fusion recapitulates the intracellular vesicle fusion reaction. We posit that, without activation by a cognate SM protein, SNARE zippering proceeds through a different route that is not properly coupled to the activity of the juxtamembrane motif. Consistent with this model, the basal SNARE-driven fusion is insensitive to linker insertions, in stark contrast to the SNARE-SM-mediated fusion reaction. In a reconstituted fusion assay containing the Vc peptide, mutations of the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 decreased fusion kinetics (Hernandez et al., 2012) . This observation can be explained by the discovery that the Vc peptide-assisted fusion reaction mimics SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion rather than the basal fusion reaction (Yu et al., 2018) . Although the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 can associate with t-SNARE and Munc18-1 Xu et al., 2010) , our and others' data showed that the juxtamembrane motif is dispensable for SNARE-SNARE and SNARE-Munc18-1 interactions (Figure 3 ; Jiao et al., 2018) .
The juxtamembrane region of the t-SNARE subunit syntaxin also positively regulates exocytosis (Lam et al., 2008; Singer-Lahat et al., 2018; van den Bogaart et al., 2011; Van Komen et al., 2005) . However, this region lacks a hydrophobic stretch and is not known to penetrate into the surface of membrane bilayers (Lam et al., 2008) . Thus, the juxtamembrane region of syntaxin may not act as a membrane-destabilizing peptide in the fusion reaction. Instead, the lipid-binding activity of this region may regulate syntaxin localization and/or modulate other exocytic factors. As discussed above, the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE may bind and destabilize the target membrane in trans after its dislodging from the vesicle membrane, promoting lipid rearrangements in both membrane bilayers.
In this work, we focused on the conserved vesicle fusion machinery of SNAREs and SM proteins. In regulated exocytosis, the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE is expected to act in concert with other membrane-remodeling molecules, such as synaptotagmin and Doc2b, to accelerate the fusion kinetics (Hui et al., 2009; Lynch et al., 2008; Martens et al., 2007; Martens and McMahon, 2008) . Overall, our biochemical data agree well with genetic observations (Borisovska et al., 2012; Deák et al., 2006; DeMill et al., 2014; Kesavan et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2009 ). However, it should be noted that the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 also modulates the activities of specialized exocytic regulators such as Munc13 and complexin (Fang et al., 2013; Maximov et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2019) . Because these binding modes can play opposite roles in exocytosis, mutations of specific residues in the juxtamembrane motif may lead to variable consequences in vivo, depending on cellular contexts and the nature of the mutations (Borisovska et al., 2012; Maximov et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2009 ).

Microbial Strains-All the recombinant proteins in this study were expressed in E. Coli BL21 [B F − ompT hsdS(r B Vc peptide (residues 56-84 of VAMP2) were expressed and purified in E. coli using the pET28a vector Yu et al.,2018) . SNARE mutants were prepared similarly as the corresponding WT proteins. Full-length SNAREs were stored in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 400 mM KCl, 1% n-octyl-β-D-glucoside (OG), 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Soluble proteins were stored in a protein binding buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP).
Proteoliposome reconstitution-To reconstitute t-SNARE liposomes for lipid-mixing assays, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoserine (POPS) and cholesterol were mixed in a molar ratio of 60:20:10:10. To prepare v-SNARE liposomes for lipid-mixing assays, POPC, POPE, POPS, cholesterol, (N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole-4-yl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-DPPE) and N-(Lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (rhodamine-DPPE) were mixed at a molar ratio of 60:17:10:10:1.5:1.5. SNARE proteoliposomes were prepared by detergent dilution and isolated by Nycodenz density gradient flotation Yu et al.,2018) . Detergent was removed by overnight dialysis using Novagen dialysis tubes against the reconstitution buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). To prepare sulforhodamine B-loaded liposomes for content-mixing assays, v-and t-SNAREs were reconstituted in the presence of 50 mM sulforhodamine B. Free sulforhodamine B was removed by overnight dialysis followed by liposome flotation on a Nycodenz gradient. The protein: lipid ratio of v-SNARE liposomes was 1:200, similar to VAMP2 densities on native synaptic vesicles (Takamori et al., 2006) , while the protein: lipid ratio of t-SNARE liposomes was 1:500. SNARE mutants were reconstituted into liposomes at the same molar densities as their respective WT proteins. Protein-free liposomes were prepared in a similar way as SNARE liposomes except that proteins were omitted.
Liposome fusion assays-Liposome fusion and data analysis were performed as previously described Yu et al., 2019) . A standard liposome fusion reaction contained 5 mM t-SNAREs and 1.5 mM v-SNARE. In lipid-mixing assays, v-SNARE liposomes were labeled with NBD and rhodamine, and were directed to fuse with unlabeled t-SNARE liposomes with or without 5 mM Munc18-1 (Yu et al., 2019) . The samples were incubated on ice for one hour before the temperature was elevated to 37°C to initiate fusion. NBD fluorescence (excitation: 460 nm; emission: 538 nm) was measured every two minutes in a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader. In content-mixing assays, unlabeled t-SNARE liposomes were directed to fuse with sulforhodamine B-loaded v-SNARE liposomes. Sulforhodamine B fluorescence (excitation: 565; emission: 585 nm) was measured every two minutes. At the end of the reactions, 10 μL of 10% CHAPSO was added to each sample to lyse the liposomes to obtain the maximum fluorescence. Liposome fusion data were presented as the percentage of maximum fluorescence change. The maximum fusion rate within the first 10 minutes of a liposome fusion reaction was used to represent the initial rate. Statistical significance was calculated for each figure based on at least three experiments.
Liposome leakage assays-Sulforhodamine B-loaded protein-free liposomes were mixed with buffer or a SNARE peptide (added to a final concentration of 100 μM). Sulforhodamine B fluorescence was measured over time at 37°C. At the end of the reactions, 10 μL of 10% CHAPSO was added to lyse the liposomes to obtain the maximum fluorescence. The data are shown as percentage of maximum fluorescence. The N-peptide and Vc peptide were expressed and purified from E. coli whereas the juxtamembrane motif peptide of VAMP2 was synthesized by Biometik (95% purity). The sequences of the SNARE peptides are listed below: N-peptide (residues 1-35 of syntaxin-1): MKDRTQELRTAKDSDDDDDVTVTVDRDRFMDEFFE.
Vc peptide (residues 56-84 of VAMP2): RDQKLSELDDRADALQAGASQFETSAAKL.
Juxtamembrane motif peptide (residues 79-94 of VAMP2): TSAAKLKRKYWWKNLK.
Liposome co-flotation assay-Liposome co-flotation assay was carried out using a previously established procedure (Shen et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2018) . Soluble proteins were incubated with protein-free or v-SNARE liposomes at 4°C with gentle agitation. After one hour, an equal volume of 80% (w/v) Nycodenz was added and the samples were transferred to 5 × 41 mm centrifuge tubes. The samples were overlaid with 200 μL each of 35% (w/v) and 30% (w/v) Nycodenz, and then with 20 μL reconstitution buffer on the top. All Nycodenz solutions were prepared in the reconstitution buffer. After centrifugation at 52,000 rpm for four hours in a Beckman SW55 rotor, samples were collected from the 0/30% Nycodenz interface and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
ITC measurements-ITC experiments were performed at 25°C using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal). Munc18-1 and SNAREs were dialyzed overnight separately in an ITC binding buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM KCl, 10% Glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP) Yu et al., 2013b) . Munc18-1 protein (5 μM) was loaded into the sample cell of VP-ITC, followed by iterative injection of SNARE complexes (75 μM) into the sample cell. After polynomial baseline correction to remove a slight drift of the initial data points, the data were fitted with a nonlinear least-squares routine using the MicroCal Origin software.
Negative staining electron microscopy-Electron microscopy imaging of liposomes was carried out at Boulder Lab for 3D Electron Microscopy. Protein-free liposomes were incubated with buffer or a SNARE-derived peptide (added to a final concentration of 356 μM) for one hour at room temperature. The samples were then stained with 2% uranyl acetate and observed on a Philips CM100 scanning transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV.
GST pull-down assay-Full-length ternary SNARE complexes were assembled as previously described (Shen et al., 2007) . GST-Munc18-1 was expressed in E. coli using the pGEX4T-3-Munc18-1 plasmid and cell lysates were prepared using a protein binding buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1% CHAPS, and 1 mM DTT). SNARE complexes were added to GST-Munc18-1-expressing E. coli ly-sates. After incubation at 4°C for one hour, glutathione Sepharose beads were added to the lysates to bind GST-Munc18-1 and associated proteins. After washing three times with the proteinbinding buffer, protein complexes bound to the beads were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting using primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies. The antibodies used in this work were polyclonal anti-Munc18-1 antibodies, monoclonal anti-syntaxin-1 antibodies, monoclonal anti-SNAP-25 antibodies, and monoclonal anti-VAMP2 antibodies.
Statistical significance was calculated for each data point based on at least three experiments. Data were analyzed using the KaleidaGraph 3.6 software (Synergy) and are presented as means ± standard deviation.

The juxtamembrane motif directly destabilizes the lipid bilayer
The function of the juxtamembrane motif requires both polar and nonpolar residues • Linker insertions between SNARE and juxtamembrane motifs impair vesicle fusion (A) Sequence alignment of the juxtamembrane motifs of WT VAMP2 and a VAMP2 mutant in which the juxtamembrane motif was mutated into alanines. Asterisks indicate the conserved residues mutated in the VAMP2 mutant. Lysine 94 (K94) was not mutated because this basic residue demarcates the boundary of the TMD. Lysine 91 (K91) was not mutated because it is not evolutionarily conserved. Nevertheless, identical results were observed when K91 was also mutated ( Figure 6 ). (Yu et al., 2013a) . Biotin-labeled WT t-SNARE liposomes were anchored to avidin agarose beads and used to bind rhodamine-labeled v-SNARE liposomes (WT or mutant). The VAMP2 mutant is depicted in Figure 2A . The binding reactions were carried out at 4°C for 1 h in the absence or presence of 5 μM Munc18-1. Biotin-labeled protein-free liposomes were used as a negative control to obtain the background fluorescent signal, which was subtracted from other binding reactions to alculate SNARE-dependent liposome docking.

In diabetic use, the DPP-4 inhibitor can block the DDP-4 to attenuate GLP-1 degradation and prolong GLP-1 its action and sensitize insulin activity for the purpose of lowering blood glucose. Nonetheless the adverse effects of DPP-4 inhibitors severely hinder their clinical applications, and notably there is a clinical demand for novel DPP-4 inhibitors from various sources including chemical synthesis, herbs, and plants with fewer side effects. In this review, we highlight various strategies, namely computational biology (in silico), in vitro enzymatic and cell assays, and in vivo animal tests, for seeking natural DPP-4 inhibitors from botanic sources including herbs and plants. The pros and cons of all approaches for new inhibitor candidates or hits will be under discussion.","According to the statistics from International Diabetes Federation (IDF), there were 425 million diabetes mellitus (DM) patients in 2017 worldwide, and that number is expected to increase to 629 million by 2045. 1 Abnormally high blood glucose caused by insulin insufficiency or insensitivity can lead to severe complications such as chronic renal failure, microvascular complication, cerebrovascular accident, and infarction induced by high glycated serum and blood vessel proteins. 2, 3 Moreover, insufficient insulin signal leads to the decreased glucose uptake from the blood that, in turn, can result in ulcers, gangrene, diabetic retinopathy, and neuropathy. 2 Recent DM treatment is inclined to maintain the blood glucose level within normal limits by (e.g. nutritional therapy and physical management) and medication due to the incurable nature of DM. 4, 5 Diabetic medications can be characterized into five strategies based on their acting mechanisms: raising insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylurea and meglitinide analogs), reducing intestinal glucose absorption (e.g. acarbose), triggering insulin-independent glucose uptake signaling (e.g. thiazolidinedione and biguanide), reducing urinal glucose reabsorption (e.g. gliflozins), and prolonging insulin sensitive [e.g. dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists] [American Diabetes Association, 2019b]. These antidiabetic drugs help DM patients to maintain their blood glucose levels with various adverse effects (Table 1) , such as urine-tract infection, lactoacidosis, hypoglycemia, and obesity. These drug-related adverse effects can deteriorate the quality of life of DM patients and create unsurmountable difficulties for proper dosing regimens in a clinical setting. It has been observed that DPP-4 inhibitors can exert a similar efficacy in reducing blood glucose levels without severe adverse effects such as hypoglycemia as compared with sulfonylurea. 6 Nevertheless, The perceptions of natural compounds against dipeptidyl peptidase 4 in diabetes: from in silico to in vivo various adverse side effects associated with the current DPP-4 inhibitor can still be observed that, in turn, can severely limit their practical application. As such, there is a clinical demand for novel DPP-4 inhibitors from various sources including chemical synthesis and botanic sources containing herbs and plants with fewer side effects. In this article, we have reviewed various approaches including in silico, in vitro enzymatic and cell assays, and in vivo animal tests in the search for natural DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Two forms of DPP-4 DPP-4, which is a 88 kDa serine protease, contains one region of cytoplasmic region (amino acids 1-6) coupled with transmembrane domain (amino acids 7-28) and extracellular region (amino acids 29-766) with the main catalytic domain. 14 There are two DPP-4 isoforms in the body: membranebound DPP-4 (mDPP-4) composed of full-length DPP-4 peptide; and soluble DPP-4 (sDPP-4), whose cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions are absent. 14 Both forms can exert various biological activities in regulation of physiology and pathology. 15 Biological function of soluble form DPP-4 sDPP-4 is secreted by lymphocytes, circulates in the blood, 16 and shows high concentration in kidney. 17 It has been observed that sDPP-4 plays various roles in improving skeleton muscle activity, immunocyte activation, chemotaxis, and homeostasis. sDPP-4 can secrete into serum via the response of skeletal muscle cells upon acute physical activities or feeding protein hydrolysate. 18 Secreted sDPP-4 can reduce vasoconstriction that is caused by neuropeptide Y (NPY) and subsequently increase the arteriolar diameter of skeletal muscle that provides a physiological explanation for raising training efficiency caused by 20 In addition to arteriolar diameter of skeletal muscle, secreted sDPP-4 acts as myokine, which stimulates inflammation in smooth muscles from blood vessel through activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)/ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway, increasing proinflammatory cytokine release and finally stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation. 21 In T-cell activation, sDPP-4  can activate T-cell proliferation via co-stimulation  with T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and Toll-like receptor, whose activation is neither associated with its enzymatic activity nor with adenosine deaminase binding. 25-28 On the other hand, sDPP-4 can upregulate the expressions of IL-6 and TNF-α in monocyte through caveolin-1/ERK/NF-κB/c-Fos signaling, which is involved in monocyte proliferation. 29 It is noteworthy that Tansi et al. proved the interaction between DPP-4 and HIV-1 transcription regulator Tat (HIV-1-Tat). 30 Markedably, the effect on DPP-4/HIV-1-Tat in viral infection and proliferation needs further investigative attention. The role of sDPP-4 in chemotaxis regulation is related to the degradation of chemokine. Hematopoietic stem cell homing is attracted by stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), which are substrates of both sDPP-4 and mDPP4. 15, 31 Accordingly, sDPP-4 inhibition can improve success rate of transplantation after analyzing the relationship between sDPP-4 activity and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 32 The known DPP-4 (both soluble and membrane-bound forms) substrates include numerous homeostatic hormones such as GLP-1, NPY, glucagon, peptide Y, and secretin, which accurately regulate blood sugar homeostasis. 15 GLP-1 is involved in insulin sensitivity and secretion, food reward, and appetite through ghrelin and leptin, and cellular metabolism with adiponectin. 15 activity in end-stage renal disease patients before and after kidney transplantation, and sDPP-4 activities were found to decrease after kidney transplantation. 50 These results suggest that serum sDPP-4 activity can be a potential biomarker for monitoring the progress of autoimmune disease and the prognosis of organ transplantation. Interestingly, serum sDPP-4 activity can be associated with the progress of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 51 which is highly correlated with respiratory inflammation, obviously indicating the relationship between serum sDPP-4 activity and COPD progression. 52 However, the prognosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), which is a rare pulmonary malignancy, can be predicted by sDPP-4 activity in pleural fluid. 53 The pathological correlation between sDPP-4 activity and MPM prognosis is still veiled. These reports provide interesting suggestions about sDPP-4 levels as the biomarkers of various diseases, which are not easy to monitor in serum or other body fluid.
Remarkably, mDPP-4 can be found mainly in the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, T lymphocytes, and reproductive organs. 54, 55 Biological activities of mDPP-4 include the regulation of immune response and blood vessel function. 15 mDPP4, also named CD26, is a T-cell co-stimulator of T-cell receptor responding to antigen-presenting cells. 56 Thus, mDPP-4 recently has been 4 journals.sagepub.com/home/taj considered as a potent target in treatment of transplantation and autoimmune disease. Dolanbay et al. reported an interesting study about the impact of mDPP-4 inhibition in early pregnancy that can be important in treating recurrent implantation failure. 57 In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication, which is critical in survival rate after transplantation. 58 Zhang et al. proved the association between Th17 cells and GVHD and which Th17 cell can be regulated by mDPP-4 inhibition that indicates current DPP-4 inhibitors can help ameliorating the onset of GVHD. 59 The impact of mDPP-4 in immune regulation is also implicated in autoimmune disease and hypersensitivity. mDPP-4 expression levels in CD8 + T cells of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients are significantly lower than healthy subjects that is plausibly attributed to disease progression. 60 In contrast, mDPP-4 levels are almost 11-fold higher in psoriatic skin than in normal skin, asserting the involvement of mDPP-4 in psoriatic development. 61 mDPP-4 plays a positive role in asthma progress through promoting T-cell activation. 62 These reports have unequivocally demonstrated the positive role played by mDPP-4 in immune regulation. mDPP-4 acts on both endothelial and epithelial cells in regulation of blood vessel function,. In addition to endothelial inflammation caused by sDPP-4, the role of mDPP-4 in endothelial generally involves the endothelial migration, angiogenesis, and proliferation under hypoxia status, which can be found in the development of endometriosis. 63 Xu et al. have pointed out that DPP-4 inhibitors that can alleviate pulmonary artery remodeling and, finally, delay the development of pulmonary hypertension. 64 In the regulation of cardiovascular function, mDPP-4 inhibition can reverse diastolic left ventricular dysfunction via inhibiting mDPP-4/SDF-1α related angiogenesis. 65 mDPP-4 involves in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for epithelial cell, 66 suggesting the potential implication of mDDP-4 in promoting cancer development. In fact, breast cancer metastasis can be triggered by DPP4 inhibition through CXCL12/CXCR4/mTOR pathway. 67 However, DPP-4 inhibitor shows the opposite activity in non-small cell lung cancer, which suppresses cancer cell growth via macrophagemediated natural killer (NK) cell activation. 68 Collectively, these studies have furnished comprehensive descriptions of mDPP-4 biological functions in the whole body and further manifest that DPP-4 inhibition (sDPP-4 or mDPP-4) can produce unexpected side effects.
The endocrinological impact of DPP-4 is more prominent in the mediation of blood glucose. DPP-4 inhibition is a predominant approach for treating diabetes because of prolonged incretin half-lives within serum, especially in type 2 DM. 69 In addition, it has been suggested that sitagliptin can preserve pancreatic β-cell function and subsequently stabilize insulin secretion as shown by two 4-year clinical trials, in which sitagliptin was adopted to treat slowly progressive type 1 DM (SPTIDDM) and latent autoimmune diabetes adult (LADA). 55, 70 In addition to clinical treatment, DPP-4 levels can be used as a biomarker. For instance, high serum sDPP-4 levels can be referred to the elevated glycation end products, which subsequently evoke endothelial cell damage and diabetic nephropathy incidence. 71, 72 In addition, high serum sDPP-4 levels also indicate worse drug response to DPP-4 inhibitor and hyperglycemia, which are the indicators of poor glycemic control and advanced disease progress. 73, 74 The above information emphasizes the effect of DPP-4 inhibition and monitoring in DM treatment. The method of screening DPP-4 inhibitor and the recent known natural DPP-4 inhibitors are presented in the following.
In silico screening of DPP-4 inhibitors Virtual screening has been seamlessly integrated into drug discovery and development 75 and its success significantly relies on compound library, 76 especially the structural diversity of compound library. 77 For instance, microalgal metabolites were screened for DDP-4 inhibitors. 78 Compared with the synthesized chemicals, natural compound libraries generally consist of more structurally diverse compounds than their synthetic counterparts, 79 providing a better screening resource. As such, numerous studies have adopted various natural compound libraries to find novel DDP-4 inhibitors as listed in Table 2 .
It is not uncommon to observe that docking studies were carried out based on a single DDP-4 crystal structure, despite the fact that a great number of DDP-4-inhibitor co-complex structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Deng et al. 88 for instance, docked a series of synthesized triazole-based uracil derivatives into the linagliptin-DDP4 co-complex structure (PDB code: 2RGU) using the standard precision (SP) Glide (Schrödinger, Inc.), which places internally generated ligand conformations with various positions and orientations into the binding pocket. Deng et al. 89 employed Gold (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center), which is a genetic algorithm (GA)-based scheme to explore the conformational flexibility of ligand and the rotational flexibility of receptor, to dock synthesized pyrazolo inhibitors into the quinazolinone-DDP4 co-complex structure (PDB code: 2ONC). 90 It should be noted that both
Glide and Gold are flexible docking algorithms. 91 Nevertheless, DDP-4 is unrestrained per se as manifested by the fact that DDP-4 consists of various binding subsites, namely S 1 , S' 1 , S 2 , S' 2 , and extensive S 2 , etc., to which the corresponding amino acids of the DDP4 substrate peptide designated by P 1 , P' 1 , P 2 , P' 2 , etc. from the nearest to the farthest cleavage point can bind as shown in Figure 1 ,92 and S 2 , which is composed of various hydrophobic residues, namely GLU205 and GLU206 dyad and ARG125, is highly plastic. 93 Furthermore, Nabeno et al. categorized inhibitors into three different classes (Figure 1 ) based on the interactions between inhibitor and DDP-4 subsites as listed in Table 3 , from which it can be observed that inhibitors of different classes bind to different DDP-4 subsites, and S 1 and S 2 are the Table 2 . Natural compound libraries adopted by various studies.

It can be argued that molecular dynamics (MD) can be used to address the flexibility of DDP4 as illustrated by the study of Liu et al. 98 Nevertheless, the lengthy MD calculation will substantially increase computational time and expense, making it impractical to be carried out in a high-throughput fashion, let alone the more resource-demanded quantum mechanical (QM)/ molecular mechanics (MM) algorithm. 99 
There are four types of assay methods for screening DPP-4 inhibitors for direct testing: direct enzymatic assay, in vitro cell assay, ex vivo assay, and in vivo animal tests. DPP-4 and tested compounds are mixed in the direct enzymatic assay, followed by adding specific substrate peptides such as glypro-p-nitroanilide. The chemical p-nitroanilide will be released from peptides and the amount is determined by optical absorption at 405 nm at noninhibition state. 105 This method is fast for analysis and can be used to evaluate the inhibition pattern from calculated K i values. However, the minimum changes within direct enzymatic assay cannot be directly translated into the actual bioactivity in cells and animals. 106 Ex vivo assay can simulate the biological interaction within body, whereas it needs fresh serum or tissue sample as the source of DPP-4. 107,108 Moreover, previous studies reported that mucosal DPP-4 inhibition can be possibly related to the onset of coeliac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder due to the immune response to gluten. 109, 110 However, a modern version of DPP4 activity assay needs to homogenize the whole intestinal biopsy that, in turn, can lead to mucosal DPP-4 inhibition. 108 Yazbeck et al. have derived a new DPP4 substrate with 13 C isotope that can be released upon reaction with DPP-4. 111 As such, the requirement to homogenize the biopsy is completely exonerated, leading to higher correlation as compared with its conventional counterparts. 111 Myocytes and pancreatic cells are often used in the cell-based assays to discover DPP-4 inhibitors. Because β-cells in pancreatic islet is an important GLP-1 target, the downstream signaling of GLP-1 in pancreatic cells can be an indicator or biomarker of DPP-4 activity. 112 In addition, GLP-1 attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiomyocyte inflammation. The variations of inflammatory signaling including NF-κB, ERK, and TNF-α within LPS-induced cardiomyocyte can indirectly gauge DPP-4 activity. 113 Nevertheless, the results of cell-based assay can be an authentic representative of the realistic situation mainly due to the fact that they do not consider in vivo pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic factors. Nevertheless, direct action upon target cells can be very helpful in detailing intracellular dynamics prior to clinical or animal tests.
DPP-4 inhibitors have been highlighted as potential regimen for autoimmune-disease based on the characteristics in T-cell activation and inflammation. 55 Notably, autoimmune animal model becomes a platform for testing in vivo efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors in long-term administration. 114 Alternatively, in vivo assay of DPP-4 inhibitory efficacy can be verified by diabetic animal model despite the fact that DPP-4 can degrade GLP-1, leading to insulin desensitization and secretion decrease. 112 The most unvanquished limitation of in vivo test is that only end-point effect can be observed in pre-testing drug candidate despite the fact that it is more related to clinical situations. The data retrieved from in vitro and direct enzymatic assay can be synergistically essential for understanding the conceivable hypoglycemic mechanism.
The effects of DPP-4 studies were mainly focused on immune, endocrine, and neuron system from the end of 1990s to early of 2000s. [115] [116] [117] A study reported in 2006 that incretin was the molecular target of DPP-4, suggesting the implication of DPP-4 inhibitor in diabetes treatment. Consequently, the diabetic research has turned into a new paradigm for searching for antidiabetic DPP-4 inhibitors. 118 To date, only very limited natural DPP-4 inhibitors from various sources/origins have been reported (Table  4 ). Natural DPP-4 inhibitors from different origins using different approaches for screening the compound to reach the target are summarized as follows. In addition to plant source, DPP-4 inhibitors from animals and microbes are singlesubclasses, in which DPP-4 inhibitors from animals and microbes are peptides and macrolides, respectively. Interestingly, the most predominant subclasses of DPP-4 inhibitors are terpenoids, peptides, phenolics, and flavonoids. 121 The protein hydrolysates from whey, barbel, and yam can reduce the DPP-4 activity in enzymatic measurements. [122] [123] [124] [125] Through partition by molecular sieve, the highest inhibition peptide sequences of DPP-4 such as Ala-Pro, Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, Trp-Ser-Gly, and Phe-Ser-Asp have been found. [126] [127] [128] Nevertheless, these results from in vitro enzymatic assays cannot guarantee a promising future since physiological regulation of DPP-4 is far more complicated than bench-top experiments. Therefore, the results from direct enzymatic assay for new candidates or hits require further validation such as in vivo investigations to confirm their actual therapeutic values when compared with clinical medicines.
Previous sections have described the biological functions, assay methods, and known natural DPP-4 inhibitors, which are purported to treat DM. However, DPP-4 inhibition can possibly cause unexpected sequela owing to its entanglement with immune response and endothelial functions. In fact, the roles of DPP-4 in tumorigenesis and progression, respectively, have been reviewed recently. 144, 145 In lung cancer and 153 In conclusion, DPP-4 inhibitors can be used to treat DM, whereas their complications with other immune disease or cancer should be seriously considered.
The effect of virtual screening via computational biology or informatics further combined with in vitro enzymatic and cell assay, and in vivo animal tests offer a promising approach to discover candidates or hits for expediting the preclinical development process ( Figure 3 ). Nevertheless, poor or ill drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties make substantial contributions to drug attritions, 154 and little effort has been dedicated to profiling ADME/Tox properties of DDP-4 inhibitors. As such, it is necessary to predict ADME/ Tox parameters in the process of virtual screening, which should be carried by adopting schemes that can consider the unstructured nature of DDP-4, to minimize the late-stage failures.

59,9d12f3a201435c9d24dc9b356283edf8bd3a234d,"Japanese encephalitis (JE) is neuroinflammation characterized by uncontrolled infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We previously demonstrated exacerbation of JE following CD11c hi dendritic cell (DC) ablation in CD11c-DTR transgenic mice. Moreover, CD11c hi DC ablation led to abnormal differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes and enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in promoting the progression of JE. Here, we examined changes in lymphoid and myeloid-derived leukocyte subpopulations associated with pro-and anti-inflammation during JE progression. The analyses of this study focused on regulatory CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells, and CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes. CD11c hi DC ablation resulted in the accumulation of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in the CNS, thereby leading to lower ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells. This result was corroborated by the higher expression levels of IL-17 and RORgT in CD4 + T cells from the brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. In addition, CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed higher frequency and total number of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, whereas CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes were detected with lower frequency and total number in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, CD11c hi DC ablation altered the phenotype and function of CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes, resulting in lower levels of activation marker and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-b) expression. Collectively, these results indicate that CD11c hi DC ablation caused an imbalance in CD4 + Th17/Treg cells and CD11b + Ly-6C hi /Ly-6C lo monocytes in the lymphoid tissue and CNS during JE progression. This imbalanced orchestration of pro-and anti-inflammatory leukocytes following CD11c hi DC ablation may contribute to the exacerbation of JE. [Immune Network 2017;17(3):192-200] ","Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), and Zika viruses, are major current and emerging threats to millions of people worldwide. Among the neurotropic flaviviruses, JE virus (JEV) is considered the most serious because of its neurotropical impacts, higher fatality rate, and permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae (1) . The expanding geographical range of JEV and potential for outbreaks of JE in nonimmune populations demand an urgent effort to develop effective antiviral therapies or alternate strategies to limit the immunopathology of JE (2) . Indeed, considerable progress in immunopathological studies of JE has been made in both infected patients and murine models (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . JEV replicates in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) as primary target cells (9) , and in these cells, the virus travels from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS), where it causes neurological disorders (10) .
DCs are antigen-presenting cells (APC) that play a crucial role in initiating adaptive immune responses as well as regulating innate immunity, with various immunological functions such as the ability to express MHC class II, stimulate naïve T-cells, and crosstalk with NK cells (11) (12) (13) (14) . The role of DCs in neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic viruses like JEV is not fully understood because of their complex multi-cellular interactions with innate-like NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages and functions in immune homeostasis and tolerization (15, 16) . However, CD11c-DTR transgenic (Tg) mice, which express the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) gene under the control of a cloned Itgax promoter and allow conditional DC depletion upon DT injection, have been a critical tool in the in vivo study of DC immunology (17) . Using this conditional DC depletion model, we previously demonstrated marked exacerbation of JE progression and abnormal differentiation of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes following CD11c hi DC ablation (18) . Moreover, CD11c hi DC ablation enhanced the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by affecting the regulation of tight junction and adhesion molecules during JE progression (19) .
Typically, murine monocytes are subdivided by the expression of Ly-6C and CX 3 CR1 into Ly-6C hi CX 3 CR1 lo CCR2 + CD62Land Ly-6C lo CX 3 CR1 hi CCR2 -CD62Lmonocytes. CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes are known to play a role in regulating host defense and repairing tissues after inflammatory injury, whereas CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes are specifically recruited by CCL2 to inflamed sites, where they become classically activated M1 macrophages and/or Tip-DCs (20) . Thus, CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes are known to significantly reduce the immune-privileged status of the CNS (21) and exacerbate the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis (18, 22, 23) . In addition, CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), which regulate excessive immune responses, accumulate preferentially over other effector Th cells at inflamed sites because of homing receptors such as CCR5 (24) (25) (26) . In contrast, a skewed IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cell response at inflamed sites may exacerbate JE progression (26) . Results of these studies provide insight into how the balance of pro-and antiinflammatory leukocytes can affect the progression of immunopathological diseases such as JE.
Here, we examined the changes in lymphoid and myeloidderived leukocyte subpopulations related to pro-and antiinflammatory reactions during JE progression in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice, with a focus on the infiltration of Foxp3 + Treg/IL-17 + Th17 cells and Ly-6C hi /Ly-6C lo monocytes into lymphoid tissue and the CNS. Our data revealed that CD11c hi DC ablation resulted in the predominance of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells and inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes over Foxp3 + Tregs and CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes in the lymphoid tissue and CNS during JE progression. Therefore, the imbalanced environment of Foxp3 + Treg/IL-17 + Th17 cells and Ly-6C hi /Ly-6C lo monocytes in response to CD11c hi DC ablation may contribute to the exacerbation of JE progression. maTeRIals aND meThODs ethics statement All animal experiments described in the present study were conducted at Chonbuk National University according to the guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Chonbuk National University (http://lac.honamlife.com/research/research_05. php). The study was pre-approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of Chonbuk National University (permission code 2013-0028). Animal research protocols used in this study followed the guideline set up by the nationally recognized Korea Association for Laboratory Animal Sciences (KALAS). All experimental protocols requiring biosafety were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBC) of Chonbuk National University.
animals, cells, viruses, and reagents C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) mice (4~6 weeks old) were purchased from Samtako (O-San, Korea). CD11c-DTR transgenic (Tg) mice (B6.FVB-Tg Itgax-DTR/EGFP 57Lan/J [DTR]), which express the diphtheria toxin (DTR) gene under control of a cloned Itgax promoter and thus allow conditional DC depletion upon DT injection (17) , were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All mice were genotyped and bred in the animal facilities of Chonbuk National University. The JEV Beijing-1 strain was propagated in a mosquito cell line (C6/36), using DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 U/ml) (18, 19) . The virus stocks were titrated by conventional plaque assay using BHK-21 cells (CCL-10; American Type Culture Collection), and stored in aliquots at -80ºC until use. The mAbs used for the flow cytometric analysis and other experiments were obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) or BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). Diphtheria toxin (DT) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The primers specific for cytokines (18, 19, 26) were synthesized at Bioneer Corp. (Daejeon, Korea) and were used for PCR amplification of target genes.
Intracellular staining for analysis of CD4+ Th1, Th17, and Treg cells To monitor CD4 + Th cell subsets, mice were infected i.p. with 3.0×10 7 pfu of JEV and sacrificed at 5 days postinfection (dpi). Brain leukocytes and splenocytes were prepared and cultured in 96-well plates (10 6 cells/well) with PMA plus ionomycin (Th1 and Th17) in the presence of monensin (2 mM) at 37ºC for 5 h. Stimulated cells were washed twice with PBS and surface-stained with FITC-anti-CD4 at 4ºC for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS containing monensin and then fixing cells, cells were washed twice with permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and then stained with PerCP-anti-IFN-g and APC-anti-IL-17a in permeabilization buffer at room temperature for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS, cells were fixed with fixation buffer. To monitor Tregs, brain leukocytes and splenocytes were surfacestained with FITC-anti-CD4 markers on ice for 30 min, followed by fixation with permeabilization concentrate buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) at 4ºC for 6 h. After fixation, cells were washed twice with permeabilization buffer and stained with PE-anti-Foxp3 antibody in permeabilization buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. To monitor the expression of transcription factors specific for each Th cell subset, CD4 + T cells were sorted from CNS-infiltrated leukocytes and briefly stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin for 3 h. The expression of transcription factors (RORgT, T-bet, GATA3, Foxp3) specific for each Th cell subset was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), using total RNA extracted from stimulated CD4 + T cells.
Mice infected with JEV were perfused with 30 ml of HBSS at 3 dpi via cardiac puncture of the left ventricle. Brains were harvested and homogenized by gently pressing them through 100-mesh tissue sieves and then digested with 25 mg/ml collagenase type IV (Worthington Biochem, Freehold, NJ), 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor Nap-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 10 mg/ml DNase I (Amresco, Solon, OH), and 10 mM HEPES in HBSS at 37ºC for 1 h with shaking. Cells were separated using Optiprep density gradient (18/10/5%) centrifugation at 800×g for 30 min (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway), and then cells were collected from the 18% to 10% interface and washed twice with PBS. Splenocytes and brain leukocytes were then counted and stained for CD11b, Ly6G, Ly6C, and CD45, using directly conjugated antibodies (eBioscience), at 4ºC for 30 min. Finally, these cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde. Data were collected and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickson Medical Systems, Sharon, MA) and FlowJo (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA) software, respectively.
The expression of cytokines (IL-1b, TNF-aIL-6, IL-10, TGF-b) and growth factors (Flt3-L, G-CSF) in sorted CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes was determined by quantitative SYBR Green-based real-time qRT-PCR. Mice were infected i.p. with JEV (3.0×10 7 PFU), and splenic CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes were sorted at 3 dpi. Total RNAs were extracted from sorted CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes and then used in real-time qRT-PCR performed with a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Following reverse transcription of total RNAs using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), a reaction mixture containing 2 ml of template cDNA, 10 ml of 2× SYBR Primix Ex Taq, and 500 nM primers in a final volume of 20 ml was prepared. The cDNA was denatured at 95ºC for 30 s and then subjected to 45 cycles of 95ºC for 5 s and 60ºC for 20 s. After the reaction was completed, the temperature was increased from 65ºC to 95ºC at a rate of 0.2ºC/15 s, and fluorescence was measured every 5 s to construct a melting curve. A control sample that contained no template DNA was run with each assay, and all reactions were performed at least in duplicate to ensure reproducibility. Amplifica-tion of the target was confirmed by a melting curve analysis. All data were analyzed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager version 2.1 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
All data were expressed as the average±standard error, and statistically significant differences between groups were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test for leukocyte population analysis or ANOVA and post-hoc testing for multiple comparisons of the mean. The statistical significance of cytokine gene expression was evaluated by Mann-Whitney test or unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. A p-value≤0.05 was considered significant. All data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPadPrism4, San Diego, CA, USA).
Increase of Il-17 + CD4 + Th17 cell proportion following CD11c hi DC ablation in lymphoid tissues and the CNs during Je progression We previously showed that CD11c hi DC ablation exacerbated JE progression and resulted in the under-maturation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes and enhanced permeability of the BBB (18, 19) . Here, we hypothesized that JE was exacerbated in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice through additional mechanisms such as abnormal infiltration and/or maturation of lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes related to pro-and anti-inflammatory processes. Since the roles and quantities of CNS-infiltrated CD4 + Th cell subsets, including IFN-g + Th1, IL-17 + Th17, and Foxp3 + Tregs, have been not defined, we decided to examine changes in CD4 + Th cell subsets in the spleens and brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice during JE progression. Interestingly, our data revealed that CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in spleens at 5 dpi, but IFN-g + CD4 + Th1 cells showed no change in frequency (Fig. 1A) . The accumulation of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in spleens was more apparent in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice; CD11c hi DC-ablated mice contained fewer IFN-g + CD4 + Th1 cells in their spleens (Fig. 1B) .
In addition, CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells were detected at a lower frequency in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice during JE progression (Fig. 1C) , and CD11c hi DC-ablated mice had fewer CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs in their spleens (Fig. 1D) . These data suggest that the altered balance of CD4 + Th cell subsets (IL-17 + Th17 and IFN-g + Th1 cells) and regulatory CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs may contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, the frequency and total number of infiltrated IL-17 + Th17, IFN-g + Th1, and Foxp3 + Treg cells were determined in the CNS at 5 dpi. As expected, IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells were detected at higher levels in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice ( Fig. 1E and F) . However, CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency and absolute number of IFNg + CD4 + Th1 cells in the CNS, which contrasted with the results from the spleen. This discrepancy may be caused by CNS-infiltration of CD4 + Th1 cells from the spleen that is considered reservoir. Therefore, enhanced CNSinfiltration of Th17 and Th1 cells seems to contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. In support of this, vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed higher proportion of CNS-infiltrated CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells (both frequency and total number) than CD11c hi DCablated mice (Fig. 1G and H) . This imbalance in Th17 and regulatory Treg cells that infiltrated the CNS resulted in a higher ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, compared to that in CD11c hi DCablated mice (Fig. 1I) .
Moreover, we examined the expression of transcription factors associated with the differentiation of CD4 + Th cell subsets in CD4 + T cells sorted from the brain. As expected, CD4 + T cells from the brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed higher levels of IL-17 and RORgT in the CD4 + Th17 cell subset and T-bet in the CD4 + Th1 cell subset, whereas Foxp3 expression in Tregs was lower (Fig.  2) . In conclusion, CD11c hi DC ablation causes an imbalance in Th17, Th1, and Treg CD4 + cell subsets during JE progression, thereby contributing to the exacerbation of JE.
CD11c hi DC ablation causes fewer ly-6C lo monocytes to accumulate in lymphoid tissues and the CNs during Je progression Myeloid-derived leukocytes in the CNS may be responsible for inducing pro-and anti-inflammatory changes, which can lead to significant pathological outcomes during JE progression. Monocytes and macrophages are important contributors and/or regulators of immunopathological progression. Typically, two principle subsets of murine monocytes are identified, based on the expression of lymphocyte antigen 6C (Ly-6C) (20) . Inflammatory/classical monocytes are Ly-6C hi CCR2 hi CX 3 CR1 lo/int , whereas patrolling/ non-classical monocytes are Ly-6C lo/int CCR2 -CX 3 CR1 hi (20) . In a previous study, we showed that CD11c hi DC ablation caused abnormal differentiation of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes during JE progression, contributing to the exacerbation of JE (18) . Therefore, we were interested in the changes in CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes, but not CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, during JE progression in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. CD11c hi DC ablation increased the proportion of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in spleens during JE progression, whereas CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes decreased in CD11c hi DCablated mice, compared to those in vehicle-treated

After vigorous heart perfusion, CD4 + T cells from CNS-infiltrated leukocytes were briefly stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin for 3 h. The expression of transcription factors specific for each CD4 + Th cell subset was determined by real-time qRT-PCR using total RNA extracted from stimulated CD4 + T cells.

CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 3A) . Accordingly, CD11c hi DCablated mice contained a higher number of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the spleen, but a lower number of splenic CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes (Fig. 3B ).
In line with the data from the spleen, CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency and total number of CNS-infiltrated CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, but fewer CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes in the brain (Fig. 3C and D) . This contrast in the accumulation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes in the spleens and brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice resulted in a markedly increased ratio of Ly-6C hi to Ly-6C lo monocytes (Fig. 3E) . This dysregulated accumulation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes in the spleen and brain may contribute to the exacerbated progression of JE in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice.
altered features of CD11b + ly-6C lo monocytes in CD11c hi DCablated mice CD11c hi DC ablation induces the abnormal differentiation of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes and thereby exacerbates JE progression (18) . Thus, we examined the differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice during JE progression. Our data revealed that CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes from the spleens of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice expressed anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-b at lower levels, compared to those from CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 4A) . One interesting result was that splenic CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed higher levels of expression of some growth factors associated with the differentiation of monocytes and DCs, including G-CSF and Flt3-L. Furthermore, CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes in the spleens of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed lower levels of expression of activation markers, compared to those in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 4B) . The frequency and absolute number of CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes in the brain during JE. The frequency and absolute number of CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes were determined by flow cytometric analysis using splenocytes or brain leukocytes prepared from JEV-infected CD11c-DTR mice at 3 dpi.

in exacerbated JE progression. However, theoretically, it is conceivable that enhanced infiltration of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 and inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the CNS facilitates JE progression (18, 26) . Our data supports this, suggesting that CD11c hi DC ablation can exacerbate JE progression by promoting an imbalance in the infiltration of IL-17 + Th17 to Foxp3 + Treg cells and Ly-6C hi to Ly-6C lo monocytes in the CNS. Furthermore, CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes likely differentiate into CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes and become tissue-resident macrophages at the late stage in inflammatory disease (15

60,0167dddb0e2783a60841b8e6f2b4e4cb981904e2,"Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease and is characterized clinically by chronic obstinate diarrhea. Three Japanese Black (JB) fattening cattle (2 males and 1 female) on different cattle farms presented with chronic episodic diarrhea without fever or dehydration. Soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1−3 cm) were occasionally excreted within the diarrheic feces. Administration of antibiotics, antidiarrheal drugs and vermicides had no therapeutic effect, but dexamethasone improved the fecal characteristics. The symptoms persisted until the animals were slaughtered at 27-30 months of age. Histopathological examination of the intestines revealed marked eosinophilic infiltration in the lamina propria and submucosa. From these findings, we diagnosed these cattle as the first cases of EOE in Jb cattle. KEY WORDS: eosinophilic enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Japanese Black cattle","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a group of idiopathic, chronic gastrointestinal tract disorders characterized by infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract by inflammatory cells that are generally confined to the mucosa, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils and eosinophils [6] . IBD is a common disease characterized by persistent or recurrent gastrointestinal signs, such as diarrhea and weight loss, in certain animal species and humans [6, 7] . Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is part of the IBD complex and is a morphological diagnosis characterized by inflammation in which eosinophilic leucocytes predominate [1] , with clinical signs typified by chronic obstinate diarrhea. It is a minor cause of IBD in humans [6, 11] , dogs [10] , cats [4, 5] and horses [1, 8, 9] ; however, few cases of EOE in cattle have been reported [2] . This research group previously reported 4 cases of idiopathic EOE in cattle, aged 1 (Angus heifer), 5 (Simmental bull), 7 (Holstein cow) and 11 (Holstein cow) years old, diagnosed on the basis of clinical and histopathological findings and exclusion of other differential diagnoses for cattle with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. However, to the best of our knowledge, neither the occurrence of EOE in Japanese black (Jb) cattle nor the associated clinical symptoms from the first appearance of their symptoms after purchase or birth to completion of their fattening periods (approximately 30 months of age) have been reported thus far.
Herein, we describe 3 JB fattening cattle that showed chronic diarrhea with excretion of ""spherical tissue"" in their feces and improved fecal characteristics for several days with only dexamethasone administration. Thus, we made a preliminary diagnosis of EOE on the basis of a combination of clinical findings and exclusion of other diseases by biochemical analysis before slaughter at completion of the normal fattening period and confirmed the diagnosis by histopathological examination of intestinal tissues. Predictive diagnostic criteria of bovine EOE are proposed from the clinical and histopathological findings.
Our clinical records from 2010 to 2013 include 3 such cases: 3 Jb animals (2 steers and 1 heifer) reared for fattening purposes on different cattle farms. The detailed information/ histories and clinical signs of these 3 animals are summarized in Table 1 . All 3 animals displayed similar characteristic clinical symptoms: chronic episodic diarrhea without fever or dehydration starting at an early stage after purchase (Cases 1 and 2) or birth (Case 3), with occasional excretion within the diarrheic feces of a small number of soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1−3 cm in diameter) of unknown origin (Fig. 1) . In all cases, although therapeutic interventions consisting mainly of antibiotics, antidiarrheal drugs and vermicides administered when the diarrhea was observed had no therapeutic effect, the administration of dexamethasone (3−5 mg/head mixed with ampicillin and administered by intramuscular injection daily for 3 days) temporarily improved the fecal characteristics for a period of several days. The chronic diarrhea and excretion of the ""spherical tissue"" persisted until the cattle were slaughtered at 27-30 months of age; however, all 3 animals had normal appetites, growth rates and body weights when compared to other cattle without diarrhea that were housed on the same farm. For exclusion of differential disease diagnoses, antemortem fecal examinations of these 3 animals were performed to determine the presence of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, culture on DHL agar and detection of 99K antigen with TETRASTRIPS [bio-X Diagnostics, Sprl]; Salmonella spp., culture on DHL agar; Clostridium perfringens, culture on DHL agar; and C. difficile [C. Diff Quick Check Complete; Techlab ® ]), viruses (coronavirus [Tetrastrips; bio-X Diagnostics, Sprl]) and rotavirus [Tetrastrips]), protozoa (Eimeria spp. and Cryptosporidium spp.) and parasites. A complete blood count and serum biochemical profile were performed in 2 of the animals (Cases 2 and 3). Additionally, PCR and ELISA (Johne's screening ELISA kit; Institute of Microbial Chemistry) assays were performed to exclude bovine viral diarrhea (bVD) and Johne's disease, respectively. Overall, pathogenic microorganisms that may cause longterm chronic diarrhea were not detected in the feces of the 3 animals. Additionally, the test results for bVD and Johne's disease were negative.
For final diagnosis of the affected animals, tissue samples of the intestinal tracts were collected immediately after slaughter at completion (27 and 30 months of age) of the fattening period and were evaluated histopathologically, along with the excreted spherical tissues, which were collected at first appearance of the symptoms and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The fixed intestinal and spherical tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 4-µm thickness, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined histopathologically. Macroscopic observation of the intestinal tract revealed areas of severe hemorrhage, particularly in the colonic mucosa, in all 3 cases (Fig. 2) . However, macroscopic observation revealed no pathological abnormalities in other organs in any of the 3 cases. Histological examination revealed marked eosinophilic, lymphocytic and plasmacytic inflammatory-cell infiltration in the lamina propria of the jejunum, cecum, colon and rectum, which partially extended to the submucosa (Fig. 3) . Microscopic examination of the spherical tissues in the diarrheic feces revealed that they consisted mainly of a fibrin clot, including mucosal epithelial cells, red blood cells and eosinophils, which were speculated to have derived from the persistently inflamed tissues in the intestinal tract of the affected cattle (Fig. 4) .
The white blood cell (WBC) counts were 8,800 and 10,500 cells/µl, and the percentages of eosinophils were 3% and 1%, respectively, which indicated no elevation of eosinophils in the peripheral blood. Parameters reflecting hydration status were all within the normal range. Additionally, although the levels of certain serum biochemical parameters were outside the reference range (e.g., in Case 3, the high GGT concentration [37.0 U/l] was considered to reflect cholangitis diagnosed when the animal was slaughtered), no abnormalities in the biochemical profile of the parameters reflecting albumin and electrolyte levels affected by enteritis were observed. Overall, the results of hematological and biochemical analyses prior to slaughter indicated no signs of inflammatory reaction in 2 of the animals with EOE.
EOE has previously been diagnosed in cattle [2] on the basis of a combination of clinical and histopathological findings and exclusion of other diseases. Additionally, we made a preliminary diagnosis of EOE in our 3 animals by consid- ering the clinical symptoms, including the response to corticosteroids and the results of clinical examinations of blood and fecal samples to exclude differential disease diagnoses. The diagnosis of EOE was confirmed by histopathological examination of intestinal tissues obtained at slaughter after completion (27 and 30 months of age) of fattening.
On the basis of clinical and examination results of the 3 affected cattle in the present study, the following antemortem predictive diagnostic criteria and/or clinical characteristics of bovine EOE are proposed: (1) chronic obstinate diarrhea persisting until 27−30 months of age; (2) maintenance of good growth rates; (3) excretion of spherical tissues including eosinophils in feces; (4) normal WbC, eosinophil counts, total protein and A/G ratio; and (5) good therapeutic response to corticosteroids. Eosinophilia, hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia have been suggested as useful parameters in the diagnosis of EOE based on hematological and biochemical examination results [3, 7, 9] . Additionally, it has been suggested that there is a strong relationship between the clinical and biochemical findings and the degree of eosinophilic infiltration of intestinal layers in EOE-affected animals [7] . In the present study, the results of hematological and serum biochemical examinations in our 3 cattle cases were within normal ranges, which was in agreement with a previous report in cattle by Cebra et al. [2] . Although the reasons for the discrepancies between the results of hematological and serum biochemical examinations and the chronic symptoms exhibited by the affected cattle are obscure, this finding suggests the possible pathophysiology in EOE-affected cattle. Additionally, histopathological examination of the intestinal tissues from the 3 animals indicated marked infiltration of eosinophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria of the mucosa, with occasional extension of the infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells into the submucosa or muscular layer of the jejunum, ileum and large intestine, which might be in line with the previous report by Cebra et al. [2] . However, the clinical symptoms of our patients differed from those in the report by Cebra et al. [2] regarding 2 parameters: (1) maintenance of good growth rates and (2) excretion of carneous tissue. Cebra et al. [2] suggested that there is a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms in EOE in cattle; this might explain these differences. Cebra et al. [2] diagnosed EOE in 2 out of 4 affected cattle during the antemortem period by examining excisional biopsy samples obtained during exploratory laparotomy via a right-flank incision, and administration of corticosteroids was initiated on the basis of an objective diagnosis. Allowing for evidence-based medicine and animal-welfare issues in cattle with chronic illness, endoscopic observation and biopsy of the large intestine after a preliminary diagnosis of EOE has been made may enable timely confirmation and appropriate treatment of EOE in Jb cattle.
The underlying cause and pathophysiologic mechanism of EOE have not been determined in humans and animals [1, 2, 7] ; possible proposed causes include food allergies and endoparasitism. Interestingly, the typical symptoms of chronic diarrhea continued in the heifer in Case 3 from the lactation period to slaughter, indicating that food allergies are a possible cause of EOE from birth to maturity in cattle.
Expansion of the clinical database of bovine EOE is needed to clarify the etiology of this disease.
Administration of corticosteroids has been reported to be effective for the relief of clinical symptoms of EOE in humans [7] and certain animal species [2] , and may be useful for the elimination of certain differential disease diagnoses in cattle practice. In our study, dexamethasone administration was initiated in one case in the lactation period, and the series of treatments were repeated when the diarrhea returned. Cebra et al. [2] reported that long-term administration of corticosteroid with gradually diminishing doses was effective for resolving diarrhea and maintaining growth rates. Therefore, we assumed that administration of dexamethasone on recurrence of diarrhea would have positive effects regarding the growth rate of the EOE cattle.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, these cases are the first JB cattle cases of idiopathic EOE. The excretion of spherical tissues in the feces may serve as an important and identifiable clinical sign in affected cattle. Idiopathic EOE should be considered a differential diagnosis in cases of chronic obstinate diarrhea in Jb cattle.",Three cases of idiopathic eosinophilic enteritis with chronic obstinate diarrhea in Japanese Black fattening cattle,"FUSHIMI, Yasuo; TAKAGI, Mitsuhiro; KAWAGUCHI, Hiroaki; MIYOSHI, Noriaki; TSUKA, Takeshi; DEGUCHI, Eisaburo",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383781/,127,1735,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,357af8bb837fb3521423284fa624316d0965bfa3,"Case summary This work describes the diagnosis and successful treatment of a 2-year-old domestic cat infected with Leishmania species and presenting fever, and ulcerative and nodular skin lesions after being treated for pyodermatitis for 1 year without clinical improvement. After anamnesis the cat was submitted to a complete clinical examination. Blood was collected for determination of haematological and biochemical parameters, detection of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and Leishmania amastigotes. Fine-needle aspiration puncture from the skin nodules was also performed. After definitive diagnosis the animal was treated and followed up over a 2 year period. The animal tested negative for FIV-specific antibodies, FeLV antigen and feline coronavirus RNA. Leishmania amastigotes in the skin nodules were confirmed by cytology and molecular diagnosis. Treatment was initiated with allopurinol, resulting in a slight clinical improvement. Thus, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate was added and administered for 30 days, with complete closure of the ulcerative lesions in the hindlimbs requiring a surgical approach. Close monitoring of the patient in the following 24 months indicated that combined therapy was safe and clinical cure was achieved without further relapses or side effects. Relevance and novel information Considering the increasing number of feline leishmaniosis cases and the inconsistent results of most therapeutic protocols described in the literature, the use of new approaches, especially in refractory cases, is essential. Although the use of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate is off-label in cats, in this case the combination treatment was followed by an extensive analytical monitoring, supporting their safety and effectiveness.","The occurrence of feline leishmaniosis (FeL) has increased worldwide, revealing a possible role of cats in leishmaniosis epidemiology. Better accuracy of laboratory techniques has improved the diagnosis of this disease, and changes in ecosystems over the last few years associated with the use of repellents on dogs might play a role in sandflies' altered feeding patterns in urban areas, leading to infections in other mammalian hosts. [1] [2] [3] Worldwide epidemiological surveys of Leishmania species causing feline asymptomatic infection and FeL have been reported. 4, 5 In Europe, Spain had the first described FeL case in 1932. 6 Some authors claim that low prevalence of FeL in endemic areas may be related to a natural resistance to the parasite in cats. 7 Moreover, the number of clinical cases may be underestimated, leading to few reports and lack of information by clinicians and owners. Although Portugal is an endemic country for canine leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum, there are few published clinical reports of FeL, with the first description of it in 1994 in Sesimbra, followed by others in Porto and Lisbon. [8] [9] [10] Despite occasional reports of ocular and visceral disease, dermatological, mucocutaneous/mucosal presentations and lymph node enlargement are the most frequent clinical features. [11] [12] [13] [14] Clinical suspicion is based on history, clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities. Diagnosis is confirmed with parasitological and serological methods. 15 A long-term administration of allopurinol (10-20 mg/kg q12h or q24h) is the most recommended treatment protocol for FeL, 10, 11, 15 however, similarly to dogs, recurrence can occur if the infection is not cleared. Some authors have reported a good clinical response using N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate monotherapy (5-100 mg/kg or 375 mg/cat q24h SC or IM under different protocols). 8, 15 This study aims to describe the treatment of a recurring clinical case of FeL in a cat receiving combined therapy (allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate).
A 2-year-old domestic European neutered male cat was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, with multiple nodular skin lesions (Figure 1 ), ulcerative dermatitis involving the four limbs ( Figure 2 ) and fever. The cat was referred 1 year after the onset of skin lesions and was previously treated for a presumptive pyodermatitis with prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q12h for 12 days) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20 mg/kg PO q12h for 6 days), followed by doxycycline (5 mg/kg PO q12h for 8 days), and showed no clinical improvement.
The cat was not vaccinated, but had been regularly protected against ectoparasites with fipronil and imidacloprid. At first admission, mild fever (39.5ºC) and dermatological lesions on the head and limbs were the only abnormalities on physical examination. About 20-25 skin nodules measuring 2-10 mm in diameter were distributed on the outer pinnal surfaces ( Figure 1a ) and orbital regions (Figure 1b ). Most of them were observed on the pinnae, where they gathered with coalescing patterns. Differential diagnosis was pyodermatitis, allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, neoplastic disease or A complete blood count and biochemical profile were used to evaluate the clinical status of the cat before treatment, after treatment and at all follow-up examinations. Urinalysis and urinary protein: creatinine ratio were evaluated 6 months after treatment. Haematological and biochemical values were within the reference intervals. Serum protein electrophoresis showed an albumin: globulin ratio, but a slight hypergammaglobulinaemia was evident ( Table 1 ).
The patient was tested for FIV-specific antibodies, FeLV antigens by ELISA (ViraCHEK/FIV and ViraCHEK/FeLV, respectively; Synbiotics) and immunoflourescence antibody test (IFAT) using an adaptation of Leishmania Spot IFI kit (bioMérieux) with a fluorescently labelled anticat IgG conjugate (anticat IgG MegaCor; MegaCor Diagnostik), which was used to quantify anti-Leishmania antibodies (cut-off 1:40). Previous studies, including more than 100 cats, validated this latter test in inter-laboratory assays using known positive and negative sera, with results as expected. Repeatability and reproducibility were also assessed (unpublished results). The cat tested negatively for FIV antibodies and FeLV antigens, but was positive for anti-Leishmania antibodies, with a titre ⩾1:1280 (Table 1) . Fine-needle aspiration puncture from the ear skin nodules was performed. Smears were stained with Giemsa (Merck) and examined under an optical microscope (Olympus BX51). The aspirate was also used for further molecular and parasitological analysis. The smears revealed Leishmania amastigotes (Figure 3) , and absence of bacteria/neutrophilic infiltration or characteristic cells of autoimmune diseases.
DNA extraction from EDTA blood samples, skin nodules and lymph node aspirates was carried out with a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen). Detection of feline coronavirus from plasma was performed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), 16 targeting the 3′ end of the virus genome. Additionally, qPCR using L infantum-specific Taqman probes targeting the kinetoplast minicircle DNA (kDNA) was also performed to determine the initial and follow-up parasitic load. 17 RT-qPCR was negative for coronavirus, while qPCR of skin nodules and blood samples were positive for L infantum kDNA, showing a parasitic load of 1700 and 0.1 parasites per 50 ng DNA, respectively ( Table 2) .
Nodular and lymph node aspirates were inoculated in Schneider's Insect Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 0.6% (w/v) of CaCL 2 , 5 mM Hepes, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. 18 Cultures were maintained at 24ºC in a refrigerated incubator (Lovibond) and observed by optical microscopy after 8 days of incubation. Viable promastigotes were observed.
The cat was treated orally with 10 mg/kg allopurinol q12h and a three-layered bandage was applied to the four limbs. Medical follow-up was performed every 2 days during the first fortnight. After 15 days of treatment with allopurinol only a slight clinical improvement was noted. Fever persisted and skin ulcers seemed equally profound. Therefore, a combined therapeutic protocol not yet approved for cats was suggested to the owner. N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate administration is off-label in cats, with only a few published cases of FeL treated with this drug. After owner consent was obtained, treatment was reinforced with 50 mg/kg N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate (Glucantime; Merial) q24h SC for 30 consecutive days. This study was conducted in the framework of FCT Project PTDC/CVT/118566/2010, with the agreement of the Ethics Committee and Animal Welfare of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon.
During and after treatment there were no abnormalities reported by the owner. The cat maintained a normal physical condition 19 and examination apart from the skin lesions.
Total remission of skin nodules on the head, as well as the foreleg ulcers, was achieved ( Figure 4) , with body temperature being normalised on day 45. Complete closure of the hindlimb ulcerative lesions did not occur owing to an extreme tension in those regions, which required surgery ( Figure 5 ). One hour prior to surgery, the cat received a therapeutic protocol of Ringer's lactate fluid therapy, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (8.75 mg/kg IM), buprenorphine (0.02 mg/ kg IM) and methylprednisolone succinate (1 mg/kg IM). Propofol (4 mg/kg IV) was used for the induction of anaesthesia followed by isoflurane for its maintenance. Debridement and excision of the wound edges were performed and a horizontal mattress suture was used for closure. The excised edges of the defect were immersed in a 10% formalin solution to allow for histopathological study.
The cat was medicated with antibiotic (amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, 12.5 mg/kg PO q12h for 10 days) and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (tolfenamic acid 4 mg/ kg PO q 24h for 4 days), and was assessed 48 h after surgery in order to evaluate the regions operated on; stitches were removed on days 6 and 12. As an integral part of the healing process, the cat was maintained for 2 weeks with Robert-Jones bandages. The complete healing of hindlimb lesions was achieved 1 month after surgery ( Figure 6 ). Histological examination of the removed tissues showed a granulomatous-like inflammatory response with some foci of lymphocytes, activated plasmacytes and occasional intracellular amastigote forms of Leishmania species in macrophages.
The slight hypergammaglobulinaemia observed at admission returned to normal values. No further clinical or laboratory changes were detected 6, 18 and 24 months after the end of treatment (Table 1) . Allopurinol was stopped when antibody titres decreased to 1:40 (18 months). At month 24, the antibody level remained unchanged.
Parasitic load decreased in both blood and skin nodules after 15 days of combined treatment. The lymph node parasitic load showed a pronounced decrease after day 30 (Table 2 ).
FeL is rarely reported in various parts of the world. 4, 20, 21 In Europe, a total of 46 clinical cases have been published between 1989 and 2014, namely in Italy, France, Spain and Switzerland, with regards to cats imported from Spain. 4, 20, [22] [23] [24] In Portugal, although the first clinical case was reported in the 1990s, 8 only in recent years have epidemiological studies been conducted to better understand the role of cats in the biological cycle of Leishmania species. In the metropolitan region of Lisbon, although the detection of anti-Leishmania antibody titres points to 3 This disease is seldom considered during the differential diagnosis in cats, as in the present clinical case, where the animal had been previously treated for other diseases for 1 year.
Dermatological findings in FeL usually include erythema, alopecia, papules, nodules, ulcers or crusts, with the head being the most affected region, but other body parts may also be affected. 17, 25, 26 In the present clinical case, as the ulcers in the hindlimbs were severely contaminated at first examination, it was not possible to determine whether the fever was a systemic sign of FeL or a consequence of secondary bacterial infection. Concerning the available therapeutics for FeL, this cat was first treated with allopurinol, which was insufficient despite its use being common in the treatment of canine leishmaniosis. Even though the use of allopurinol is offlabel in both dogs and cats, there is a more extensive clinical experience of efficacy and safety in dogs. Under the scope of 'cascade' a combined therapeutic not yet approved for cats was suggested to the owner.
Initially, this cat showed very high antibody titres by IFAT as seen in other reported cases of FeL. 12, 13, 23 After 2 weeks of the combined protocol the decrease in antibody titre and parasitic load was evident. Similarly to canine leishmaniosis, there was a gradual decline in antibody titre and it took around 18 months to attain the lowest titre. Clinical remission was accomplished together with surgical recovery in less than 2 months. Furthermore, this therapeutic protocol seemed to be safe for the cat as no analytical change or side effect was observed.
By 24 months of follow-up, no relapses had occurred. Regarding the albumin levels, although within the reference interval, the increase noted, associated with the decrease in gamma(γ)-globulin values, kept the total protein concentration within the reference interval, which is in agreement with the remission of clinical signs.
Cats may live for years with a slowly progressing chronic disease, even without a specific anti-Leishmania treatment. 4, 5, 15 However, in this case, the severity of cutaneous lesions was the clinician's main concern leading her to search for another therapeutic protocol when monotherapy with allopurinol proved to be insufficient.
Although full clinical recovery was achieved, it is possible that a much reduced number of viable parasites may have persisted (mainly in the lymph nodes) after the end of the treatment. However, as it is not possible to guarantee total elimination or its dispersion to the skin, parasite transmission should be kept in mind. These facts highlight the need for new topical insecticides aiming to prevent sandfly bites in cats, as all insecticide products currently registered against sandflies contain permethrin, which is extremely toxic to cats.
The present work describes a successful case of FeL treatment in a young cat, negative for FIV antibodies and FeLV antigenaemia, after a 15 day refractory period using allopurinol monotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a combined therapy, using allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate with no relapses or adverse effects, resulting in a possible new treatment for use in FeL refractory cases.",Successful treatment of feline leishmaniosis using a combination of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate,"Basso, Maria Alexandra; Marques, Cátia; Santos, Marcos; Duarte, Ana; Pissarra, Hugo; Carreira, L Miguel; Gomes, Lídia; Valério-Bolas, Ana; Tavares, Luís; Santos-Gomes, Gabriela; Pereira da Fonseca, Isabel",JFMS Open Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5362848/,254,2007,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,2bae24fa42f6bd7e9a241b4456296f3af0ee4b2c,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and most devastating of the primary central nervous system tumors, with few patients living beyond 2 years postdiagnosis. The damage caused by the disease and our treatments for the patients often leave them physically and cognitively debilitated. Generally, GBMs appear after very short clinical histories and are discovered by imaging (using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and the diagnosis is validated by pathology, following surgical resection. The treatment response and diagnosis of tumor recurrence are also tracked by MRI, but there are numerous problems encountered with these monitoring modalities, such as ambiguous interpretation and forms of pseudoprogression. Diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers would be an immense boon in following treatment schemes and in determining recurrence, which often requires an invasive intracranial biopsy to verify imaging data. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are stable, membrane-enclosed, virussized particles released from either the cell surface or from endosomal pathways that lead to the systemic release of EVs into accessible biofluids, such as serum/plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. EVs carry a wide variety of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites, with many common features but with enough individuality to be able to identify the cell of origin of the vesicles. These components, if properly interrogated, could allow for the identification of tumor-derived EVs in biofluids, indicating tumor progression, relapse, or treatment failure. That knowledge would allow clinicians to continue with treatment regimens that were actually effective or to change course if the therapies were failing. Here, we review the features of GBM EVs, in terms of EV content and activities that may lead to the use of EVs as serially accessible biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment response in neuro-oncology.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV glioma) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in the United States, striking some three in 100,000 people. Patients with GBM are faced with a poor prognosis as 5-year survival rates are less than 5% for all age groups (of those $75 years of age, virtually none are alive by that time). 1 Roughly 17, 000 Americans are diagnosed with GBM each year, and the disease claims ∼13,000 lives, with most succumbing in 1-2 years, despite gross total surgical resection, external beam radiation treatment, and the latest in multimodal chemotherapy. 2 These therapies are relatively nonspecific and come at significant cognitive and physiopsychological costs to the patient, as the brain is an organ that can not tolerate much collateral damage. Despite the relatively short time course of the disease, the financial burdens at a familial level, are staggering, 3 
GBMs are highly invasive malignant neoplasms of glial cells within the central nervous system that carry a very poor prognosis, despite advancements in surgical and oncological modalities. Neurosurgical resection of GBMs has failed to offer patients with a curative option as even radiological imaging with contrast enhancement of disease inadequately correlates with actual neoplastic disease burden ( Figure 1A) . Thus, gross total resection, using the radiological image of the apparent tumor margins, fails to address the microinfiltrative disease beyond the borders of the radiological depiction (which can be identified upon histological representation). 6−8 Histologic characterization of GBMs commonly shows small areas of central necrosis, with a distinct pseudopalisading rim of anaplastic glial cells and a hyperplastic, hyperpermeable vasculature, which differentiates these tumors from lower-grade astrocytomas ( Figure 1B and C) . Examination of the pseudopalisading network of neoplastic glial cells is remarkable for disease heterogeneity. The neoplastic heterogeneity observed in GBM poses significant challenges in disease treatment as well-known oncological therapeutics fail to target the entire disease burden and may actually select for inherently resistant neoplastic cells. 9−12 Further histological investigation of the brain parenchyma beyond the location of the radiographical depiction of the disease often reveals significant microinfiltrative tumor cells, which are thought to be a major contributor to the dismal prognosis of GBM. 6, 9 The inability to cure GBM via neurosurgical resection and the failure of our current therapeutics contribute to the urgent need for further GBM tumor characterization.
There have been remarkable strides made recently in the molecular genetic characterizations of GBMs, which have been valuable in the initial understanding of the detrimental effects of GBM and may prove useful in the stratification of patients by therapeutic response and/or in clinical trials. 13 However, these types of tumor identifiers are obviously evident only after the tumor is present and accessible. For the purposes of serial monitoring during the course of treatment or the early detection of recurrent tumors, biofluid-based biomarkers will be essential tools. Virtually all biofluids (eg, serum/plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, breast milk, semen, colostrum, bronchial lavage fluid, ascites fluid, saliva, and synovial fluid) have one set of common components -extracellular vesicles, consisting of exosomes and microvesicles. 14, 15 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-enclosed, virus-sized (30-1,000 nm) nanovesicles that are released 
Glioblastoma extracellular vesicle biomarkers extracellularly from cells, either directly from the cell surface (called ""microvesicles,"" ""microparticles,"" or ""ectosomes"") by membrane ""blebbing"" or via the formation in an endocytic route, with fusion of a late endosome/multivesicular body with the plasma membrane (""exosomes"") 14, 15 ( Figure 2 ). Extracellular release deposits EVs into systemic or circulating fluids, with the potential for proximal and distal effects. These vesicles contain numerous cellular constituents, such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites, that have common denominators in terms of the biogenesis of vesicle formation and cargo loading, but the constituents also have sufficient specificity that they can identify the cell of origin of their release. EVs are stable and protect the constituents from nucleases, proteases, and the other means of degradation found in the biologically harsh extracellular environments. 16 EVs also have physicochemical properties that enable their purification via standard procedures. 17, 18 Based on these features, EVs appear to be veritable repositories of potential biomarkers for health and disease, 19 and this is clearly evident in oncology as well, 20 especially in neuro-oncology, where the needs for diagnostic, prognostic, and predicative biomarkers are urgent. 21
The term ""biomarker"" (as in ""biological marker"") seems straightforward, but some definitions are applicable. Typically a biomarker refers to ""a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention."" 22 This is a broad statement but encompasses most aspects. There are three recognized subcategories of biomarkers: 1) diagnostic markers that identify the presence of and specific type of disease; 2) prognostic markers used to imply outcomes independently of therapy; and 3) predictive markers that can inform in the context of particular treatment response. For gliomas, we currently know of nothing truly useful as an early-stage diagnostic biomarker as most GBMs present as full-blown tumors with little or no prior clinical evidence of their existence. 23 There are certain molecular features of GBMs that aid in and verify diagnoses, and some of those are also prognostic and may be predictive (study of this is ongoing). 24 The current line of thought in this area is that recurrent genetic abnormalities are able to subcategorize GBMs into groups, defined as Classical, Mesenychmal, Proneural, and Neural. 25 The main features of these designations are shown in Table 1 . The gene expression patterns and genomic alterations associated with the GBM categories may eventually lead to better therapeutic strategy design, but for now, the most disturbing correlation is that only patients with the Proneural subtype show any trend towards longer survival compared with patients in the other three categories. Nonetheless, that prolonged survival is not statistically significantly different compared with the other groups and in general, it is still less than 2 years postdiagnosis.
It is important to realize that the molecular signatures of GBMs are based on analyses of actual tumor specimens or biopsies from them. Thus, the use of those molecules in the ongoing monitoring of patient progress or response to therapies may be limited, suggesting that biofluid-based biomarkers are likely to be of far more practical benefit. Circulating biomarkers may be serially collected, which is essential for therapeutic assessment, and the (usually) minimally invasive nature of collection (compared with the substantial intracranial interventions at surgery or biopsy) is also attractive.
As mentioned above, most GBMs present acutely, with relatively few clear indications of the oncoming pathogenesis 
Redzic et al (usually, headache, seizures, intracranial pressure, vision/ hearing issues, and even personality changes), making the window for early disease screening almost nonexistent. Imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 26 /magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) 27 are standard brain tumor diagnostics; these are clearly valuable but are limited to use after a tumor is suspected due to the aforementioned symptoms. Also, these techniques are extremely expensive, as is the entire brain tumor affliction. 28 Such imaging modalities generally offer little histologic or prognostic information without employing specialized technologies such as various forms of positron emission tomagraphy, vessel architectural imaging, or stimulated Raman scattering. Beyond that, the only acceptable diagnoses are made, intra-or postoperatively, by pathology, which offers prognostic evaluations using immunohistochemistry or genetic techniques. 29, 30 Obviously, those tests require tumor access from surgery or biopsy, both intracranially invasive procedures. This is especially true for recurrent tumors (which occur with nearly all patients with high-grade gliomas), where imaging distinctions for remnant tumor, regrowth, or postradiation necrosis are difficult, 31 and ""pseudoprogression"" (radiographic indications -usually, gadolinium enhancement -that appear as progressively growing tumor following radiation but later resolve or devolve into radiation necrosis) is another common problem. 32, 33 Tumor diagnostic/biomarker capabilities from an accessible compartment (blood/sera, urine, or saliva) would be a major advance for neuro-oncology, especially since there seem to be no circulating exfoliated brain tumor cells 34 (cerebral spinal fluid offers mixed results 35, 36 ). Thus, most biomarker efforts for GBM are geared towards the determination of recurrent disease, either in the context of standard of care treatment or in a clinical trial setting, with an emphasis on clinical-level assessments.
Most of the proteins previously identified as putative GBM biomarkers in blood may be more closely associated with the GBM and its treatment as markers of neurotrauma rather than being unequivocally related to the tumor itself. 34 These proteins include glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), chitinase-3-like protein (CHI3L1) or YKL-40, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Other factors that are known to be secreted by tumors or by immune cells following encounters with GBMs include transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) family members 37 as well as interleukin 10 (IL-10). 38 So far, there has been no clinical validation of these serum-borne molecules as glioma biomarkers, but such research is ongoing. 21 
There is little mention of circulating lipid species as putative biomarkers for GBMs, but 24S-hydroxycholesterol is among 
Glioblastoma extracellular vesicle biomarkers the lipids described as brain-specific that have been identified in the systemic blood circulation. 39 However, hydroxycholesterol seems only to appear at high levels in serum following severe central nervous system (CNS) trauma and not necessarily in response to brain tumors. 40 
The levels of free nucleic acids in circulation is low and are difficult to detect due to the lack of protection from nucleases that are present in the circulating system. However, some potential biomarker candidates have been proposed. The circulating nucleic acid content in the serum or plasma of GBM patients consists of both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) species and was summarized in a review by Holdhoff et al. 34 Briefly, the potential circulating tumor DNA biomarkers include methylated promoter regions of O-6-methyl-guanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16), death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK), and Ras association (RalGDS/ AF-6) domain family member 1 (RASSF1A). Others have also shown methylation of promoter regions in MGMT and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN); however, detection rates of these epigenetic changes were low in serum samples, or not detectable in the case of PTEN, compared with the astrocytic tumor samples. 41 Additionally, the authors analyzed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomes 10q, 19q, and 1p in oligodendroglial tumors and reported a higher percentage of LOH in the tumor tissue compared with the serum samples. Different RNA species have also been detected in the circulation. EGFRvIII message was detected in platelets isolated from glioma patients. 42 Circulating tumor microRNA (miRNA) has also been detected in the blood of GBM patients. 34, 43 In these studies, miRNA 21 (miR-21) and miRNA 128 (miR-128) were shown to be upregulated in the blood of GBM patients. The cohorts in these studies were relatively small, less than 20 patients at most, and an analysis for these molecules should be performed on a higher number of patients to provide more evidence of the use of these molecules as biomarkers. Additionally, it is unclear how small miRNAs are present in serum without some form of proteinaceous or membrane-enclosed protection. EVs may provide that protection.
The term ""exosome"" was used to describe exfoliated microvesicles from the rat C-6 glioma line over 30 years ago; 44 the vesicle sizes (500-1,000 nm) are what we would describe today as microvesicles, and their origin appears to be from the cell surface rather than endosomal. In those and other earlier studies 45, 46 it is unclear whether any controls were used for the fetal calf serum supplementing the cell culture medium as it is now known that the fetal bovine sera frequently used in cell culture contain extracellular vesicles. 47 Those vesicles may be cleared by centrifugation (ie, .100,000× g) prior to inclusion of the sera in culture medium. We may have been the first to describe exosomes in brain tumor cell lines from both human and murine sources, 48 and our studies were soon followed by important publications from Al-Nedawi et al 49 and Skog et al. 50 The former demonstrated the presence of glioma-specific mutant EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) in EVs from both cell lines transfected with the mutant construct and from EVs in the sera of mice growing those EGFRvIII-expressing tumors. Incubation of glioma cells that did not express the mutant receptor with EVs from cells that did express it showed the transfer of EGFRvIII to the nonexpressing cells, with the concomitant activation of tumor-promoting signaling pathways associated with EGFRvIII signaling (extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]/protein kinase B [AKT] phosphorylation, VEGF release). The latter paper demonstrated the presence of mRNAs and miRNAs in the sera of patients with GBMs that may be of diagnostic utility. A major advantage of nucleic acid technologies in regard to EVs is that they have standard preparation/handling conditions, and one has the ability to amplify signals from small amounts of starting material, which is not possible with other biologics (eg, proteins and lipids). The paper also showed that there was a differential distribution of specific messenger (m)RNAs in EVs compared with the relative amounts in the cells of origin and that a model mRNA could be passaged from cell to cell by EVs, resulting in translation of the mRNA to protein in the recipient cells. Among the mRNAs found in at least some patient serum EVs, was that encoding EGFRvIII as a tumor-specific marker. Finally, the EVs had angiogenic-promoting activities in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.
Our group later showed 51 that EGFRvIII appeared on the surfaces of exosomes from EGFRvIII-expressing cells (along with heat shock proteins [HSPs] 70 and 27) and that EGFRvIII protein could be identified on EVs from the sera of patients with GBM; however, EGFR seemed to be present in sera EVs from both patients and healthy donors. Exosomes from a murine brain tumor line served as potent anticancer vaccines in a prophylactic setting but were largely 
Redzic et al ineffectual in a stringent therapeutic setting, suggesting that immune responses to tumor exosomes may be strongly context-dependent. We also performed the first proteomic survey of brain tumor exosomes in that study, identifying 36 distinct proteins, including endogenous murine retroviral Gag polyproteins. Those proteins are indicative of a retrovirus known to be involved in the progression of murine tumors by subversion of immune surveillance. 52 This paper noted the immune dichotomy of brain tumor exosomes, demonstrating the presence of putative tumor antigens as well as a number of immunosuppressive entities.
Other articles of interest have shown that various brain tumor cell EVs (from GBMs, oligodendroglioma cells, and medulloblastoma cells) have activities and impacts on recipient cells that range from transformation of those cells 53 to induction of apoptosis, 54 along with growth promotion and migratory-driving activities. 55 That paper 55 again showed the immune dichotomy of medulloblastoma exosomes in both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory functions and identified almost 150 proteins in proteomic analyses. Furthermore, in other studies, 56,57 exosomes/EVs isloated from hypoxic GBM cells enhanced GBM bioactivity and induced epithelial cells to secrete tumor-promotion factors, resulting in increased tumor growth, migration, and vascularization and angiogenesis. This involved paracrine signaling via tissue factor associated with EVs. Thus, exosomes/EVs can serve as transfer mechanisms for tumor survival and progression. 56, 57 Curiously, coagulopathies are part of the comorbidities associated with brain tumors, and tissue factor likely plays a significant part. While its presence on EVs is well known, the role of tissue factor in the context of EVs remains unclear 56, 58 and may represent an area into which therapeutic intervention can expand. 59 There have been some extremely interesting publications describing the role of EVs in the biology of GBM, but the attempts to find clear and utilizable biomarkers are at early stages, and the field faces the same (lack of) outcomes that have plagued the cancer biomarker field for years -ie, large numbers of putative biomarkers on input, few approved entities on output. 60, 61 The development of useful, robust, and clinically viable biomarkers follows a complex, multiphase pathway with harsh go/no-go decisions and is fraught with difficulties that involve biology, bioinformatics, and current plus developing (and currently unforeseen) biotechnologies. 62 However, as biomarkers are tied to clinical drug development platforms in the form of companion diagnostics, and as multiplexed systems may be necessary to validate drug efficacy, 63 EVs will likely play vital roles as reservoirs of multiple types of biologic materials suitable for biomarker assays.
As alluded to previously, EVs contain proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites that reflect their cells of origin; individual or multiple entities amongst those biomaterials may prove to be the identifiers of cancer cells in the host. As EVs are present in (and purifiable from) essentially all routinely obtainable biofluids, a distinct advantage in this scenario is that EVs bundle multiple potential biomarkers in one package. Thus, multiplexed assays that evaluate more than one biomaterial (eg, RNA and protein) could theoretically be performed on the same sample. The concept of ""liquid biopsy"" is often applied to circulating tumor cells 64 and more recently to circulating cell-free (cf)-DNA, 65 but the numbers of circulating tumor cells are often low (or even nonexistent, in the cases of patients with GBM), and cf-DNA is largely nontumor in origin. EVs overcome these barriers in liquid biopsy -EVs are known to occur in elevated quantities in the blood of cancer patients, 66−68 and the protein and nucleic acid contents can be tumor-specific. 50, 51, 55, 69, 70 With this background, we will explore what is known and what may be possible concerning the use of EVs as biomarkers for GBM.
Perhaps the best known and most specific protein marker for GBMs is EGFRvIII; this has been identified on both cell line and patient serum EVs. 49−51 It is a tumor-specific mutation (also found in several other cancer types that overexpress EGFR) 71 that deletes 267 amino acids from the extracellular domain, resulting in a truncated receptor that has no clear ligands but nonetheless signals constitutively. 72, 73 There are some discrepancies concerning the frequency of the mutant protein in GBM patient samples, perhaps resulting from differences in techniques and reagents, 71 but estimates range from 25% to over 60%. Thus, EGFRvIII seems to be an excellent putative biomarker from a diagnostic perspective, and its loss of expression may be a predictive biomarker if the protein is directly targeted. 74 However, it is likely that evaluation of the protein status would be the most direct assessment, but access to antibody reagents is limited, resulting in the use of nucleic acid techniques for detection. 75 There remains concern over the lack of correlation between polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of EGFRvIII and the actual protein expression levels, 71 so specificity and sensitivity issues may depend on the techniques employed. Gene amplification of EGFR is common in GBMs, as is overexpression of the protein (and with EGFRvIII expression in a subset of the EGFR-amplified tumors). 76 We 51 and others 49, 77 have identified EGFR in EVs from GBM cells and patient sera, but it also appears to be in EVs from healthy donors 51 and from nontumor cell lines, 78, 79 which begs the question of specificity. However, it may be a valuable biomarker tool as part of a multiparameter screening assay. 77 In a very limited study, we also identified EGFR2/v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a relatively specific marker for EVs, from patients with medulloblastoma. 55 Perhaps 17% (or more) of GBMs probed express HER2, 80,81 so this protein may also be a useful biomarker, but it is unclear whether it is incorporated into EVs from healthy donors; much larger sample sizes are necessary to establish that correlation.
Of the other proteins listed above as putative circulating protein biomarkers for GBM, all but CHI3L/YKL-40 have been found in EVs (and the mRNA for YKL-40 was identified). 50 We had identified GFAP in medulloblastoma, but it has also been identified in healthy donor human plasma EVs, 82 suggesting that it may not be tumor-specific. VEGF-A protein was identified in human GBM cell line EVs by antibody array, 50 and so far, there appear to be no other normal cell EVs carrying it, but it is obviously not a tumor-specific marker. Li et al have identified 112 proteins in a proteomic analysis of U251MG cell line-derived EVs; 83 of those, all but one (myoferlin) had been previously identified in other EVs. Our group found bFGF (also called FGF2) in medulloblastoma EVs, 55 suggesting that it may be a tumor marker, but again, it is not tumor-specific, as is true of MMP9, TGF-β, and IL-10. MMP9 mRNA was found in GBM EVs, 50 and the protein is present and active in ovarian cancer EVs. 84 MMPs and other extracellular proteases play important roles in modifying the tumor microenvironment for angiogenesis, migration, and invasion, implicating EVs as major players in this important function.
GBMs leave their hosts profoundly immunosuppressed, 85, 86 and those effects are often linked to TGF-β and IL-10. 38 Both of these cytokines are produced by immune system cells but have been identified as EV components from both cancer and normal cell types. 51, 82 There may be a question regarding the normal background amounts of those cytokines in EVs as IL-10 was identified coming from mesenchymal stem cell EVs, 82 and active TGF-β from EVs of thymus cell origin may drive regulatory T cell phenotypes. 87 Curiously, we saw what appeared to be latent forms of TGF-β on serum EVs from patients with GBMs. 51 Since active TGF-β1 has a serum half-life of ,2 minutes, 88 transport of it in blood may rely on EVs.
Other tumor-specific mutations identified in brain tumors are in the isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2). These mutations are far more prevalent in lower-grade gliomas (and secondary gliomas) than in the high grades (such as GBMs). 89 While we identified IDH1 in the proteome of medulloblastoma EVs, 55 the peptide sequence coverage did not include the potentially mutated regions. However, using an antibody specific for the IDH1 R132H mutant protein, Shao et al 77 included the enzyme as part of a fourprotein GBM molecular signature to interrogate GBM cell line and patient sera EVs. This was part of a micro nuclear magnetic resonance (micro-NMR) device study that indicated such a molecular signature, coupled with an extremely sensitive instrument, could accurately type responders vs nonresponders in both animal models and patients receiving therapy for GBMs. This, again, strongly suggests that effective biomarkers may come in packages (such as EVs), utilizable as a panel, rather than as individual entities. 90, 91 It also suggests that despite the nanoscale of EVs, microfabrication of devices capable of interrogating such vesicles for clinical applications is truly possible.
While relatively little is known about the lipid components of EVs, 92 we are learning more all the time. 93 Nonetheless, almost nothing has been reported on the lipid contents of GBM EVs. 24S-hydroxycholesterol in serum has been associated with CNS trauma 94 but not so with brain tumors; 40 still, it is unclear whether the methods for extraction and identification of 24S-hydroxycholesterol would have encompassed a significant population of extracellular vesicles, 95 and cholesterol is one of the highly enriched lipids in extracellular vesicles. 93 Thus, there may be CNS-enriched (or specific) lipid markers on the EVs from CNS tumors, but their discovery is pending.
The nucleic acid content of EVs is quite diverse. Skog et al 50 were the first to report on the mRNA and miRNA content of GBM EVs. Balaj et al found that EVs from different types of CNS tumors contained single-stranded DNA, and both complementary (c)DNA and genomic DNA as well as retrotransposable elements. 69 Redzic et al RNAs are packaged in glioma EVs. 83 miRNAs may be very useful sources of biomarker potential in GBMs, given the differences in the miRNA signature for healthy subjects and GBM patients. 83, 96, 97 Although the nucleic acid content of EVs is diverse, there are only a few potential biomarkers that have been suggested to date. As with the protein content of GBMderived EVs, the EGFRvIII mRNA is also one of the most specific and well-known markers that has been detected in EVs. In their work, Skog et al 50 purified EVs from the serum of GBM patients and detected EGFRvIII mRNA in 28% of samples tested using PCR-based methods. The percentage of EGFRvIII mRNA compared with total RNA in EVs is consistent with the percentage of GBM patients who are positive for this particular mutation, ie, about 30% of GBM patients have the EGFRvIII mutation. The detection of EGFRvIII RNA in glioma EVs was also reported by Nilsson et al, and they found that EVs are used to transfer the message to recipient cells. 42 The work of Chen et al is promising in its potential to use the detection of the IDH1 mutation in CSF as a biomarker, especially considering the sensitivity of this technique. 70 The authors used very sensitive PCR methods to detect and quantify wild-type and mutant IDH1 transcripts in EVs isolated from the CSF of glioma patients and found higher levels of mutant IDH1 in the CSF of patients with gliomas compared with healthy controls. The sensitivity of the technique is evident considering that IDH1 mutants are relatively rare in patients with GBM. 98 However, the source of material (CSF) is not a prime candidate for serial evaluation of biomarker status.
As mentioned above, Li et al 83 detected several different types of RNA in glioma EVs. Of particular interest, is their finding that in the U251 cell line, derived EV miR-21 was detected in high levels, consistent with Skog et al. 50 This finding complements the results from Skog et al, also showing a high expression of miR-21 in serum EVs from patients with GBM. 40 The results of both of these groups are consistent with reports that miR-21 is highly overexpressed in glioma tissue and suggest that miR-21 has clear potential as a biomarker in GBMs, 97, 99 particularly in the context of other putative markers. It should be pointed out that miR-21 is not specific for GBMs and is also found in the EVs of healthy donors, 100 so ""context and community"" will likely be important to determine the utility of miRNAs as biomarkers. As sophisticated, sensitive PCR methodologies become robust and more widely usable in a diagnostic setting, it is conceivable that the detection of other highly abundant GBM-specific miRNAs in biofluid EVs will be possible and may provide additional biomarker candidates.
The surfaces of EVs contain a great deal of information relative to the sizes of these tiny vesicles and considering the relatively limited internal volumes of them. Various aspects of EV surfaces may reveal much about their abilities to differentially represent the presence of tumor vs normal cells, or the changes in tumor cells due to treatment.
The surfaces of cancer cells are often differentially glycosylated compared with their normal cell counterparts, 101 thus suggesting that tumor glycomes may distinguish tumor cells from normal cells. Technologies for carbohydrate analyses are progressing, including better separation and mass spectrometry identification, as well as microarraystyle high-throughput methods. 102 The glycosylated surfaces of EVs, either in the form of glycoproteins, glycolipids, or surface-bound carbohydrates, are ripe for this type of probing.
Recently, Batista et al utilized a lectin array to study the glycomes of EVs harvested from several different sources. 103 They showed differences between the cell surface glycomes and the resulting EV glycomes, which tended to be conserved, although there were distinguishing features in the gross glycomic compositions. Urinary exosome surface glycosylation has also been proven to distinguish between EVs from healthy donors vs those with polycystic kidney disease, 104 suggesting that these surface phenomena may harbor carbohydrate biomarkers. We recently reported that particular antibodies that recognize the brain tumor-specific gangliosides 3′-isoLM1 and/or 3′,6′-isoLD1 105 would bind to glioma exosomes, 106 demonstrating that such antigens could be present on circulating EVs as biomarkers. This is a relatively unexplored area in EV biology, but it may hold great promise as a means for identifying pathology-related circulating EVs.
The EV surface proteome is likely to contain proteins (in particular, glycoproteins) that reflect the cancerous state. GBM ""stem cells"" were used to profile cell surface glycoproteins whose expression was upregulated on the ""neurospheres"" stem cells compared with classic, long-term adherent cultures. 107 Receptor-type tyrosine protein phosphatase ζ (phosphacan), 
Glioblastoma extracellular vesicle biomarkers tenascin-C, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 (CSPG4), podocalyxin-like protein 1, and cluster of differentiation (CD)90 were upregulated (and CD44 was comparatively downregulated). Of those glycoproteins, tenascin C, CSPG4, and CD44 have been identified in EVs, 82 and there is an antibody (81C6) that specifically recognizes brain tumor tenascin C 108 as well as a potential therapeutic antibody against CSPG4. 109 Thus, the stem cell portions of GBMs may have surface markers that could be released in EVs; due to the association of stem cells with tumor therapeutic resistance, these may be valuable markers, as harbingers of impending recurrence.
As mentioned above, our group identified EGFRvIII on glioma cell EV surfaces, along with HSPs 27 and 70, 51 and later, we showed HSP90 on medulloblastoma EV surfaces. 55 The presence of HSPs on brain tumor EV surfaces fits with the demonstration of the HSPs and other chaperones on the surfaces of a variety of brain tumor cells. 48, 110 As these proteins are typically regarded as intracellularly localized, these data suggest that location may relate to biomarker status, with tumors altering the ""standard"" localizations of proteins. Newer technologies, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with fluorescent (usually antibody) staining, allows for the specific quantification of labeled vesicles within the overall population of vesicles present, thus allowing for both the detection and enumeration of putative tumor or pathologic EVs in a mixed field of vesicles (eg, such as from serum 111 or from urine 112 ).

y detection for both surface and internal EV content was mentioned previously, where using a microfluidic NMR chip, GBM EVs were labeled (or lysed and internal materials labeled) with targeted magnetic nanoparticles against a four-protein signature (EGFR, EGFRvIII, podoplanin [PDPN] , and IDH1 mutant). 77 This rendered the EVs superparamagnetic and yielded faster proton decay rates for enhanced NMR signal. While none of the markers individually had high sensitivity (but overall good specificity), the combination of the four markers resulted in both high sensitivity and specificity, and the ability to quantify EVs at several logs better than current technologies. A major message here is that multiple biomarkers may be able to overcome the limitations of one or a few.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One interesting host response to tumor EVs is the antibody response against presumed surface antigens. This has been shown with model or known antigens """"loaded"""" into EVs",113, 114 but we have also shown high-titer murine responses against naturally occurring brain tumor antigens; 51,106 these responses occur very quickly and in the absence of adjuvant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conversely, tumor antigens (eg, HER2) on the surfaces of circulating tumor-derived EVs have the capacity to bind and effectively titrate out therapeutic antibodies, such as trastuzumab, potentially reducing the effectiveness of such drugs. 115 There appear to be natural antibodies that recognize reticulocyte EVs," with potential involvement in the elimination of apoptotic bodies. 116 We have shown that circulating EVs from the sera of patients with GBMs carry substantial amounts of bound antibody; those antibodies may be """"eluted"""" from the EVs", and at least some fraction of the antibodies recognize tumor antigens from GBM cell lines, in Western blots. 106 This raises the possibility that antibodies on circulating tumor EVs may be able to reveal the presence of tumor antigens, which may produce a signature on high-density protein or peptide arrays alerting of tumor presence. From a predictive perspective, one issue would be our lack of knowledge of the clearance or half-lives of such antibodies, so there may be more value in them from an initial diagnostic perspective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One should consider the concept that particular molecular entities of EVs may be difficult to identify and ascertain as recognizably different between tumors and normal cell types. However, the collection of materials may have endemic, measurable activities that could distinguish between pathologic and normal states; in a further connection of tumorigenicity to a measurable readout, EVs may be able induce responses in model cell types that could reveal the presence of tumor and perhaps even, in some situations," an """"aggressiveness"""" measure of the tumor. The following are some possible areas of assay development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biologic/metabolic enzymes represent about 25% of the proteins found in brain tumor exosomes 51, 55 and glycolytic enzymes are among the top ten proteins identified in EVs. 117 Ronquist et al recently demonstrated that prostasomes (EVs released from the prostate gland into seminal fluid) can functionally generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from substrates such as glucose or fructose, 118 indicating that EVs have intrinsic metabolic capacity. We recently showed that EVs from the sera of patients with GBM possessed the tumorassociated enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) necessary for the Warburg effect and that the addition of EVs from GBM cells increased the expression of various metabolic enzymes in those recipient cells. 106 One potential effect of the increased enzyme quantities could be increased measurable ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We previously demonstrated that medulloblastoma cells migrated towards EVs used as attractants in Boyden chamber/ transwell migration assays, 55 and this has proven true for EVs of other tumor types. 119 While this likely has more biologic than diagnostic significance, certain elements of EV activity (eg, extracellular proteolytic activity of MMP9) may have useful, measurable outputs in the appropriate assays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVs are known to transport phosphoproteins with putative signaling potential,120, 121 and GBM EVs can alter signaling pathways within recipient cells. 122 In similar assays," our unpublished data show that EVs from """"stressed"""" GBM cells (ie"," those induced to undergo the unfolded protein response) 123 drive more extensive changes in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways on recipient GBM cells than do those EVs from """"unstressed"""" cells (not shown). One could imagine a standard cell line assay", where EVs from patient body fluids were incubated with the model cell line, which was then lysed and assayed for specific (ie, limited) changes in phosphoprotein status indicative of tumor EV-driven phenotypic alterations. It is conceivable that EVs themselves could be lysed and exposed to phosphoantibody arrays that might reveal the presence of high levels of tumor-associated phosphoproteins. Other EV protein posttranslational modifications that may indicate tumor presence may include glycosylation (see above), ubiquitination, 124 citrullination, 125 acylation, 126 and other lipid modifications. We are likely just scratching the surface in understanding posttranslational modifications and their impacts on cargo loading into EVs, and potential downstream biologic significance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVs show great promise as reservoirs of biomarkers for patients with glioblastoma. The presence of EVs in every biofluid allows for theoretically easy access in minimally or noninvasive fashion, and the assortment of biomolecules surely provides a signature for the presence of disease or of change in the disease state. In few cases are the components of that signature truly tumor-specific (in the cases of GBMs, perhaps EGFRvIII and IDH mutants are tumor-restricted). Thus, we may need to quantify potential (combinations of) biomarkers, and possibly their locations in or on EVs," to distinguish the signature as distinct from normal tissue EVs. That signature may be only readable through a translation via bioassays rather than by the direct identification of """"letters"""" or """"words"""" in the signature. There is a great need for biomarker development in neuro-oncology since our current imaging systems often fail to provide adequate information concerning recurrent tumor growth or current biological status of either the primary or recurrent tumor. This paucity of information tends to drive a fairly uniform treatment regimen for every patient and thus"," fails to account for a personalized approach to monitoring disease and individual responses to therapy. It may be that these circulating """"fat balls"""" can provide that window into the presence and status of the tumor that will give us a therapeutic edge in the treatment of these devastating diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

63,27ee5b4647398fd11e7044166a9d68aca391ebcf,"Background: In the past decade, the identification and characterization of antiviral genes with the ability to interfere with virus replication has established cell-intrinsic innate immunity as a third line of antiviral defense in addition to adaptive and classical innate immunity. Understanding how cellular factors have evolved to inhibit HIV-1 reveals particularly vulnerable points of the viral replication cycle. Many, but not all, antiviral proteins share type I interferon-upregulated expression and sensitivity to viral counteraction or evasion measures. Whereas well-established restriction factors interfere with early post-entry steps and release of HIV-1, recent research has revealed a diverse set of proteins that reduce the infectious quality of released particles using individual, to date poorly understood modes of action. These include induction of paucity of mature glycoproteins in nascent virions or self-incorporation into the virus particle, resulting in poor infectiousness of the virion and impaired spread of the infection.
A better understanding of these newly discovered antiviral factors may open new avenues towards the design of drugs that repress the spread of viruses whose genomes have already integrated.","Like all intracellularly replicating pathogens, HIV-1 undergoes extensive interplay with cellular machineries and benefits from interactions with essential cofactors which enable and support HIV-1 replication. Well-known examples include the HIV-1 receptor CD4, chemokine coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4, the Tat-interacting CyclinT1 that enhances processivity of the RNA polymerase II during LTR-mediated viral transcription and the nuclear mRNA export factor CRM1. On the contrary, eukaryotic cells dispose of a set of antiviral genes, whose expression is often induced or enhanced by type I interferons (IFNs), and whose products can effectively interfere with distinct steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. The impacts of anti-HIV-1 factors acting early post-entry and during virus release include SAMHD1, APOBEC3G, Mx2 and tetherin, respectively, and are discussed extensively elsewhere.
Following integration of the proviral DNA into the host cell´s chromosome and LTR-driven transcription, newly synthesized viral proteins and the viral genomic RNA are transported to the plasma membrane in a coordinated fashion, followed by particle assembly and egress. The composition of these particles is tightly controlled and requires the proper function of viral structural, enzymatic, and accessory proteins, but also cellular factors. A budded virion is confined by a plasma membrane-derived lipid bilayer containing approximately 7-14 trimers of Envelope *Address correspondence to this author at the Institute of Experimental Virology, TWINCORE, Feodor-Lynen-Str. 7, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; Tel: +49-511-220027-198; Fax: +49-511-220027-139; E-mail: christine.goffinet@twincore.de glycoproteins [1, 2] . Gag, besides constituting the most abundant protein within virions, is essential in recruiting the viral genomic RNAs and other essential proteins, including protease, integrase and reverse transcriptase. Of note, a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism ensures incorporation of these enzymatic proteins which are expressed from a Gag-Pol polyprotein at a low frequency of 5%. Incorporated accessory proteins include Vpr, Vif and Nef. A final, protease-mediated series of Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage and rearrangement events renders immature virions fully infectious, resulting in the virons´ interior typical morphological transition from an electron-dense ring lining the surrounding membrane to a cone-shaped appearance in electron microscopy. These rearrangements furthermore trigger the clustering of the sparse Env trimers on the virus surface, an event that might contribute to virus maturation and infectiousness [3] . Importantly, the right configuration of particles is crucial for assuring a high infectious quality, which is reflected by their ability to efficiently infect new target cells. Prevention of APOBEC3G incorporation by HIV-1 Vif provides a compelling example for the fact that modulation of the (cellular or viral) protein composition of nascent virions can have dramatic (positive or negative) effects on the infectiousness of HIV-1 particles. Alternatively, alteration of the virus membrane fluidity, restriction of the accessibility of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein to the HIV-1 receptor/coreceptor complex by steric hindrance through an incorporated protein or inhibition of the maturation-induced clustering of HIV-1 Env trimers could represent mechanisms of cellular defense that target particle infectivity. Despite these theoretical possibilities, until recently no antiviral protein was known that directly reduces particle infectivity. Within the cytokine family of interferons, type I and type III IFNs exert antiviral properties, whereas type II IFNs have been considered more immunomodulatory. Whereas type III IFNs signal via a specific type III IFN receptor, which is probably not expressed at high levels on primary HIV-1 target cells in vivo [4] [5] [6] , type I IFNs robustly induce upregulated expression of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cultured primary HIV-1 target cells, including CD4+ T-cells and macrophages. ISGs constitute a large group of several hundred genes, from which only a few of them have been analyzed in-depth for potential antiviral activity. This review highlights recent research that identifies processes safeguarding HIV-1 ´s particle infectivity being highly vulnerable. Particle infectivity is negatively modulated by a diverse set of cellular proteins, comprising ISGs and non-ISGs, each of them with an individual mode of action and different sensitivity to viral counteracting strategies.
90K (according to its appearance as a 90 kDa species in SDS-PAGE)/lectin galectin soluble 3 binding protein (LGALS3BP) is a secretory glycoprotein [7] . It was initially identified as a tumor antigen which is upregulated in the context of breast [8] and lung [9] carcinoma. Physiological functions of extracellular 90K comprise modulation of cell migration and adhesion by interaction with multiple cell surface receptors, including galectin-3, and modulation of the activity of immune cells [10] . In healthy individuals, 90K protein reaches concentrations up to the µg/ml range in diverse body fluids. Since it shares mRNA upregulation in CD4+ T-cells of HIV-1 infected individuals [11] and type I IFN-induced expression [10, 12, 13] with established restriction factors of HIV-1, it was included in a functional screen of candidate ISGs for antiviral activity (Goffinet, unpublished data). 90K acts antiviral against HIV-1 by reducing the particle infectivity of newly produced HIV-1 virions [14] . This defect is accompanied by impaired incorporation of HIV-1 Env glycoproteins into virus particles, probably explaining the reduced infectious quality of de novo-synthesized virions, and defective processing of the HIV-1 Env gp160 precursor into the mature proteins gp120 and gp41. Addition of exogenous, soluble 90K to the producer cell culture fails to inhibit particle infectivity, suggesting that 90K exerts its antiviral effect intracellularly and that outside-in signaling of extracellular 90K is dispensable for its antiviral function. Analysis of a set of modified variants of 90K revealed that the two central protein-binding domains BTB-POZ and IVR are required and sufficient for 90K´s antiviral activity, since deletion of the N-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR)-like domain and the C-terminal domain did not abolish antiviral activity.
The exact mode of action of 90K remains elusive to date. Experimental data argues against a virion incorporation of 90K. Given that 90K and HIV-1 Env share subcellular localization and posttranslational maturation in the secretory pathway, and that 90K interferes with HIV-1 Env incorporation, a model in which 90K targets HIV-1 Env, either via direct or indirect interaction, has been favored. However, Co-IP experiments failed so far to provide evidence for a detectable interaction of 90K with HIV-1 Env. Thus, an indirect scenario, in which 90K inhibits the function or expression of a cellular or a viral factor that is required for efficient HIV-1 Env incorporation cannot be excluded. Although 90K expression induces a processing defect of the HIV-1 Env gp160 precursor, resulting in high cell-associated levels of uncleaved polyprotein and only a small fraction of mature gp120 and gp41, it remains unclear whether the processing defect is the direct cause for poor incorporation of mature glycoproteins or whether these two inhibitory actions can be genetically and/or functionally uncoupled. Future work is needed to clarify the exact mode of action of 90K.
In human target cells of HIV-1, 90K protein expression is highly cell-type specific. It is readily detectable in primary monocyte-derived macrophages [14] . Importantly, siRNAmediated knockdown of 90K facilitates the spread of HIV-1 in cultures of primary macrophages and increases the particle infectivity of newly produced virions, indicating that endogenous expression levels of 90K contribute to the control of HIV-1 spread in this important HIV-1 target cell type. In striking contrast, 90K protein is undetectable in primary CD4+ T-cells and in all analyzed immortalized Tcell lines, even using very sensitive ELISA assays and despite type I IFN-mediated upregulation of 90K mRNA, suggesting that 90K expression is tightly repressed at the post-transcriptional level in T-cells. Given the specific expression of 90K in macrophages within those HIV-1 target cell types that fully support virus replication, prediction of the in vivo importance of 90K is difficult. Expression levels of 90K protein in the serum correlate with viral loads, and high 90K expression levels at the viral set-point are predictive of a negative outcome of the infection [15] [16] [17] . Although this seems to contradict a protective role of 90K for the host during HIV-1 infection, a positive correlation of ISG expression and viral loads has been long-appreciated [11, 18, 19] . This observation raises the possibility that sustained upregulation of type I IFNs during the chronic phase of HIV-1 infection indirectly promotes virusbeneficial effects in addition to the direct antiviral effects of type I IFN-induced ISGs which may be protective during acute HIV-1 infection. In addition, it is important to take into consideration that levels of soluble 90K may not necessarily reflect the level of the cell-associated, antiviral protein fraction. Along this line, potential HIV-1 evasion mechanisms still need to be defined.
Keeping the density of glycoprotein molecules on the virus surface low is a property of some viruses that is particularly pronounced for HIV-1, and is thought to provide a selective advantage during immune evasion [20] . It is unclear whether the drawback of reduction of virion infectivity, induced by 90K-mediated paucity of Env embedded in particles, is outweighed by improved immune escape. More work is warranted to fully understand the impact of 90K on HIV-1 infection.
IFITM proteins are small two-pass transmembrane proteins which are located predominantly at the plasma membranes (IFITM1) or at endosomal and lysosomal membranes (IFITM2 and 3). They belong to the CD225/dispanin protein superfamily, which exists throughout the kingdoms, including bacteria, invertebrates and primates [21] . Additional family members, including IFITM5, whose expression is restricted to osteoblasts [22] , and 10 additional, recently discovered human ifitm genes [21] probably do not contribute to inhibition of HIV-1 infection or haven´t yet been tested for antiviral activity, respectively. IFITM1, 2 and 3 are almost ubiquitously expressed and their expression is further upregulated by type I IFNs [22, 23] . IFITM proteins contribute to regulation of early development, cell adhesion, and control of cell growth [24] . Virologists´ interest in IFITM proteins steeply raised upon the first description of their antiviral activity against Influenza A virus and flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Dengue virus [22] , indicating a broad antiviral activity of these small factors. Further targets of IFITM proteins are coronaviruses, Hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus and Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV) [23, 25, 26] , as well as bunyaviruses [27] and reoviruses [28] . It appears that expression of IFITM proteins in target cells is sufficient for inhibition of these viruses. Specifically, IFITM1, 2 and 3 interfere with glycoprotein-dependent fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane, preventing the delivery of viral genomes to the cytoplasm and resulting in trapping of virions in endosomes and lysosomal degradation [22] . Strikingly, a minor SNP in human ifitm3, rs12252-C, which leads to expression of an Nterminally truncated IFITM3 protein, strongly associates with a poor prognosis during pandemic H1N1/09 Influenza A infection [29] . These findings highlight the important contribution of IFITM3 in defending humans against viral pathogenic infections and establish IFITM3 as a bona-fide antiviral factor.
The impact of IFITM proteins on single-round HIV-1 infection has been discussed controversially. Using RNAi, an antiviral activity of IFITM3 was found to be unlikely to exist since no inhibition of cell-free HIV-1 was observed in HeLa CD4 cells which endogenously express IFITM3 [22] . Although IFITM proteins scored positive in a large-scale screen for antiviral activity against HIV-1, the detected antiviral effect must probably be attributed to the VSV-Gmediated entry that was employed by the VSV-G/HIV-1 pseudotypes that lacked authentic HIV-1 Env [30] . Modest consequences of IFITM2 and IFITM3 overexpression and absent antiviral activity of IFITM1 have been reported using a BlaM-Vpr-based HIV-1 fusion assay [31, 32] , suggesting that fusion of cell-free HIV-1 is only weakly affected. In contrast to the moderate effect of IFITM proteins in singleround HIV-1 infection, stable expression of individual IFITM proteins in a T-cell line effectively impedes viral spread in cell culture using a replication-competent HIV-1 [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , implying more potent effector functions of IFITM proteins in a system in which cell-to-cell transmission predominates. Indeed, findings from two independent groups recently shed some light into a potential mechanism [35, 36] . Whereas IFITM2 or 3 expressed on membranes of target cells fail to exert antiviral activity in the context of cell-tocell transmission, the antiviral capacity is more obvious when IFITM3 is expressed in the infected donor cells that transmit the virus to IFITM-negative target cells. The antiviral effect potentiates when IFITM is expressed on both donor and target cells. Specifically, IFITM proteins are incorporated into membranes of nascent virions and thereby decrease their particle infectivity by impairing fusion [35, 36] , apparently not at the expense of Env incorporation and also not in an Env-dependent manner [35, 36] . The exact mode of action of virus-associated IFITMs, whether virion incorporation of IFITM proteins is governed by specific determinants or occurs randomly, and whether IFITM proteins are incorporated in virus particles of other families, remain yet to be investigated. In the context of other viruses, multiple, partially contradicting models have been debated. It has been suggested that IFITM proteins inhibit the fusogenicity of membranes in which they locate. Specifically, IFITM3 may restrict influenza A virus entry by restricting viral membrane hemifusion [37] or by blocking the formation of fusion pores at a post-hemifusion stage [38] . An alternative hypothesis says that IFITM3 disrupts cholesterol homeostasis, leading to accumulation of cholesterol in intracellular compartments [39] . Alternatively, viral incorporation of IFITM proteins may cause exclusion and inclusion of yet to be defined specific cellular factors with antiviral activity as a consequence. Although evidence for direct viral antagonists of IFITM proteins is lacking, HIV-1 may be able to overcome IFITM-imposed antiviral activity, since evasion mutations in Vpu and Env were reported after passage of HIV-1 in an IFITM1-expressing Tcell line [33] .
Among the accessory genes of primate lentiviruses, Nef displays probably the highest degree of multifunctionality. As evidenced by infections with inactivated nef mutations or deletions in rhesus macaques and humans, an intact nef gene is required in vivo for sustained viremia and development of immunodeficiency [40] [41] [42] . Although Nef does not exert any enzymatic activity, it fulfills a multitude of functions that culminate in alteration of cell signaling and activation by interfering with the cellular vesicular trafficking machinery. Association of Nef with membranes is governed by its myristoylation; it is also incorporated in virus particles. Downregulation of several cell surface receptors, including CD4 and coreceptors, as well as MHC class I and II receptors and modulation of transcriptional activity of infected T-cells are established functions of HIV-1 Nef. Another long-appreciated activity of Nef is the enhancement of HIV-1 particle infectivity. Production of HIV-1 devoid of an intact nef gene results in impaired particle infectivity, ranging from 3 to 40-fold reduced titers, depending on the producer cell type, target cell type and viral isolate [43, 44] . The most pronounced requirement for Nef is seen in lymphoid cells. Nef-mediated enhancement of particle infectivity requires its expression in the producer cell, is highly conserved within primate lentiviruses [45] and is maintained during disease progression [46] . The fact that Nef is incorporated into virions and cleaved by HIV-1 protease during maturation of particles may support a specific function of virus-incorporated Nef that manifests itself early during the next round of infection. Its membrane association may be sufficient to result in virion packaging, since Nef is also found in orthologous retroviruses when co-expressed in the producer cell. Recently, the mechanism of Nef-mediated infectivity enhancement has been elucidated [47, 48] . Using differential mRNA sequencing in different producer cell lines that differ in their requirement for Nef for optimal HIV-1 infectivity [47] , and mass spectrometry-based approaches [48] , respectively, members of the serine incorporator (SERINC) family were identified as potent cellular inhibitors of retrovirion particle infectivity in the absence of Nef. SERINC proteins are highly conserved, multi-pass transmembrane proteins expressed predominantly at the plasma membrane with poorly elucidated cellular functions besides that they mediate serine incorporation into phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids [49] . SERINC5, which is abundantly expressed in PBMCs, and SERINC3 were reported to inhibit HIV-1 in the absence of Nef in a dosedependent and synergistic fashion that appears to require SERINC incorporation in the virion. SERINC5 inhibition acts specifically against Env-containing particles, since VSV-G pseudotypes were largely insensitive to SERINC5 [47, 48] . Nef was shown to counteract SERINC activity by downregulating it from the cell surface via clathrindependent endocytosis and sequestering it in endosomes, thus precluding their incorporation into virion particles. Interestingly, the prototypic retrovirus MLV has evolved its own antagonist (Glyco-gag) to counteract SERINC5 [47, 48] , underlining the importance of this antiviral factor. Interestingly, expression of SERINC3 and SERINC5 are not induced or stimulated by type I interferons, in contrast to the targets of most other viral antagonists [47] . The antiviral activity of SERINC5 appears to be caused predominantly by post-entry defects, since the detectable slight inhibition of virus-cell fusion does probably not fully account for the far more pronounced infectivity decrease imposed by physiological levels of SERINC5 expression [47, 48] . Future work is needed to fully understand the antiviral mode of action of SERINC proteins, and to decipher whether other enveloped viruses are prone to SERINC-mediated inhibition, and how exactly Nef counteracts SERINC proteins. Notably, a better understanding of the SERINC-imposed antiviral block to infection and the potential Nef-SERINC interface might be translated into the design of a small antiviral molecule that interrupts Nef-SERINC interaction and allows full-blown SERINC-mediated HIV-1 inhibition.
In the past decade, discovery and characterization of antiviral restriction factors has catapulted our understanding on cell-intrinsic immunity. Whereas many antiviral factors were found to target early post-entry steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle, recent findings have uncovered the potential of cellular proteins 90K and members of the IFITM and SERINC protein family to reduce the particle infectivity of HIV-1. They act by modifying the essential particle composition or by incorporating into nascent virions, respectively. Their existence may, at least partially, contribute to the inherently high frequency of uninfectious HIV-1 particles [50] [51] [52] . Extensive investigation is required to fully understand their mode of action and respective virally-encoded antagonistic or evasion strategies, and opens up an exciting new area of research, with potential translation into the design of new antiviral treatment strategies.

64,7c8829abbf6087d8a19a616952acf92bb76dc38d,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to quantify lesions on chest radiographs in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and analyze the severity of the lesions with clinical parameters.
Two experienced radiologists reviewed chest radiographs of 28 patients with SARS. Each lung was divided into upper, middle, and lower zones. A SARS-related lesion in each zone was scored using a four-point scale: zero to three. The mean and maximal radiographic scores were analyzed statistically to determine if the scorings were related to the laboratory data and clinical course.
Results: Forward stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the mean radiographic score correlated most significantly with the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001). The second most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p < 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the number of days of intubation (p = 0.025). The maximal radiographic score correlated best with the percentage of lymphocytes in a leukocyte count (p < 0.001), while the second most significant factor was the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.013). The mean radiographic scores of the patients who died, with comorbidities and without a comorbidity were 11.1, 6.3 and 2.9, respectively (p = 0.032). The corresponding value for maximal radiographic scores were 17.7, 9.7 and 6.0, respectively (p = 0.033).
The severity of abnormalities quantified on chest radiographs in patients with SARS correlates with the clinical parameters.","clinical prognostic factors of SARS (17 28) and the relationship between the imaging findings and clinical outcomes or laboratory parameters (10, 29 37) .
It has been reported that bilateral and diffuse confluent air-space opacities almost exclusively occurred in subjects with a poor clinical outcome or in those who had a more protracted clinical course (10, 14) . Patients with multifocal opacities that progressed to diffuse air-space opacification and patients presenting with diffuse air-space opacification had a high fatality rate, but patients in this group were also older and more likely to have comorbid diseases (31) . A recent study disclosed that a maximal SARS-related lesion on radiographs with a score of 7 or higher is a strong predictor of mortality, especially in patients with comorbid lung illnesses and involvement of four or more lung zones (38) . The aim of this study was to quantify the severity of lung lesions on chest radiographs in patients with SARS and to analyze the relationship between the quantified abnormalities of lung lesions and the clinical course and laboratory parameters.
During the epidemic period of SARS from March to July 2003 in Taiwan, 28 patients with probable cases of SARS were treated in our hospital. The 28 subjects include four males and 24 females with ages ranging from 13 to 87 years (mean SD = 40.78 18.02). Two patients were less than 15 years old, 20 patients were 18 to 49 years old, three patients were 50 to 59 years old, and three patients were older than 60 years. All subjects experienced fevers exceeding 38 C (100.4 F) and fulfilled the WHO criteria for probable SARS (9) . All 28 patients were subsequently shown to have significant seroconversion of the SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody indicating arecent infection by the coronavirus. In addition to having a respiratory illness of unknown cause, during the 10 days prior to onset of symptoms, 12 patients had either lived in an area in which community transmission of SARS was documented, eight patients had traveled to such an area, and eight patients had come into close contact with a person known to have SARS. The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study, and informed consent was not required from the patients.
In total, 481 chest radiographs were obtained for the 28 patients to monitor the disease process. The chest radiographs included 379 in the anteroposterior view, 94 in the posteroanterior view, and eight in the lateral view. The studies were obtained using either conventional radiography (274 examinations, AMX-4, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) or computed radiogra-phy (187 studies, Fuji Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) with images archived through a picture archiving and communications system (PACS, Centricity Workstation, version 1.0, General Electric Medical Systems). Hard-copy images from both the conventional and computed radiographies were viewed for all reports. The settings for portable radiography were 72 80 kVp at 1.25 1.5 mAs. The number of radiographs obtained for each patient ranged from 4 to 50 (mean SD = 17.18 9.84). The hospitalized days ranged from 11 to 29 with a mean of 18.17 days; thus, an average of approximately one radiograph was obtained each day for each patient, particularly during the critical period. The frequency of radiography decreased as patient symptoms abated.
Two radiologists who had 15 and 26 years of professional experience, respectively, reviewed the radiographs together. The radiographic findings were recorded without the knowledge of the clinical data but with the knowledge that the patients were victims of suspicious or probable cases of SARS. Any differences in opinion were resolved by consensus. On each radiograph, each lung was divided into upper, middle and lower lung zones transversely, with each zone spanning one-third of the craniocaudal length of the lung. The severity of the SARS-related lesions within each lung zone was evaluated by scoring the radiographs with a four-point scale based on visual assessment, as follows: 0 = normal, 1 = up to one-third of lung zone involved, 2 = between one-third and two-thirds of lung zone involved, and 3 = more than two-thirds of lung zone involved. The scores for all 6 zones on each radiograph were added to provide a cumulative score that had a range from zero to 18 (Figs. 1, 2) . In addition, data collected from all available chest radiographs included the following: whether the SARS-related lesions were unilateral or bilateral; were associated with radiographically identifiable pleural effusion (defined as increased pleural density with obscuration of the costophrenic sinuses and the hemidiaphragm with meniscus-shaped or horizontal upper border); mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (defined as widening or increased opacity of the mediastinum and pulmonary hila); cavitary lung lesions. The mean radiographic score for each patient during hospitalization was obtained by summation of the radiographic score on each radiograph divided by the total number of radiograph obtained. The maximal radiographic score for each patient represented the worst condition of lung opacities during the clinical course.
For each patient, we retrospectively recorded the age, severity of fever (degree of elevated body temperature above 38 C or 100.4 F), leukocyte count, decreased percentage (< 20%) of lymphocytes in the leukocyte count, lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count < 1,000/mm 3 ), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 15,000/mm 3 ), elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein (CRP), the number of hospitalized days, the duration of endotracheal intubation, the severity of hypoxemia (PaO 2 ), the level of retained CO 2 in arterial blood (PaCO 2 ), death, and the presence of comorbid disease. The patient status, mean value of the body temperature and laboratory data during hospitalization were analyzed if the data statistically correlated with the mean and maximal radiographic scores. The normal values, range, median, mean and standard deviation of each variable are shown in Table 1 . Seven of our 28 patients had associated comorbid diseases; these include two cases of malignancy including one associated with hypertension, and one case each of hypertension, chronic lung disease, valvular heart disease, thalassemia A close-up view of a chest radiograph in the posteroanterior projection obtained 4 days after fever onset shows a subtle ground glass density in the lateral aspect of the right upper lung (arrows) (radiographic score = 1). B. A close-up view of a follow-up chest radiograph in the anteroposterior projection obtained 8 days after fever onset shows progression of air space opacities to consolidation (black arrows), extending to the upper (small white arrow) and middle (large white arrow) zones of the right lung (radiographic score = 3). C. A follow-up chest radiograph in the anteroposterior projection obtained 14 days after fever onset shows progression of the opacities involving the upper, middle and lower zones of the right lung, as well as the middle and lower zones of the left lung.

A follow-up chest radiograph in the anteroposterior projection obtained 24 days after fever onset shows regression of the lung opacities involving the right lung, and the middle and lower zones of the left lung (radiographic score = 6). E. A follow up chest radiograph in the posteroanterior projection obtained one month after fever onset. The lung lesions had completely resolved. The patient recovered and was discharged after one month of hospitalization.
and diabetes mellitus associated with hypothyroidism. Three of 28 patients expired due to SARS: these included two women without comorbidity, aged 47 and 72 years, and one 41-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus. The onset of illness was based on the clinical manifestation of fever or body temperature above 38 C. A correlation among continuous variables including the clinical parameters and radiographic scores was assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient. A forward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed for all variables with a p-value less than < 0.1 in an univariate analyses. The Kruskal Wallis test was used to analyze whether the radiographic scores were related to the categorical variables including death, survival without comorbidity, and survival with comorbidity. Post hoc comparison using the Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U tests was performed for further analysis of the categorical variables. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered The patient expired on the tenth day after fever onset. A. A close-up view of a chest radiograph in the posteroanterior projection obtained 3 days after fever onset shows opacity (arrow) mainly in the medial aspect of the right middle lung (radiographic score = 1). B. A close-up view of a chest radiograph in the posteroanterior projection obtained 4 days after fever onset shows progression of the right perihilar opacity (black arrow) in the right middle and right lower lung zone (white arrows) (radiographic score = 3).

A Follow-up chest radiograph in the anteroposterior projection obtained 8 days after fever onset shows progression of the right perihilar opacity to the right upper zone (white arrow), middle and lower lung zones (black arrows) (radiographic score = 4). D. A follow-up chest radiograph in the anteroposterior projection obtained 9 days after fever onset shows marked progression of lung opacities to the right lung as well as to the middle and lower zones of the left lung (radiographic score = 12). E. A follow-up chest radiograph in anteroposterior projection obtained 10 days after fever onset shows progression of lung opacities to involve mainly the middle and lower zones of bilateral lungs (radiographic score = 14). The patient expired on the tenth day after fever onset.
D E statistically significant.
No mediastinal abnormality, pleural effusion and cavitation in the parenchymal lesion were observed on the chest radiographs. By univariate analysis, both the mean and maximal radiographic scores significantly correlated with fever, age, elevated white blood cell count, a decreased percentage (< 20%) of lymphocytes in the leukocyte count, lymphopenia, elevated LDH, the number of hospitalized days, the number of days of endotracheal intubation, and the level of retained arterial CO 2 ( Table 2 ).
In addition, the maximal radiographic score also correlated with the severity of hypoxemia (p = 0.050) ( Table 2) .
Using the Kruskal Wallis test, the mean as well as maximal radiographic scores significantly correlated with death and the presence of comorbid disease. The mean radiographic score of the patients who died, patients with comorbidities and without comorbidity were 11.12 2.56 (mean SD) and 6.31 5.69 and 2.89 2.55, respectively (p = 0.032). The corresponding values for the maximal radiographic score were 17.67 0.58, 9.67 8.09 and 6.00 5.00, respectively (p = 0.033) ( difference between the number of deaths and survival without comorbidity with respect to the mean as well as maximal radiographic score (p = 0.003 and p = 0.005, respectively) ( Table 4) . A forward stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the mean radiographic score correlated most significantly with the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001), while the second most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p < 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the number of days of intubation (p = 0.025). The maximal radiographic score correlated best with the percentage of lymphocytes in the leukocyte count (p < 0.001). The second most significant factor was the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001), and the third most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.13) ( Table 5 ).
Several series have described the clinical prognostic factors of SARS. These factors include the severity of hypoxemia and platelet count (17, 38) , an age over 60 years and elevated LDH (18, 20) , comorbidities (19, 27, 38) , and a high neutrophil count on admission (20) . Poor prognostic factors for SARS in radiological findings comprise the number of involved lobes during the acute phase, multifocal opacities with progression to diffuse airspaces opacification or an initial radiographic presentation with multifocal or diffuse air-spaces opacities (17, 30 32, 38) .
Three of the 28 patients expired with a mortality rate of 10.7%, which is comparable to that seen overall in Taiwan (12.3%), Hong Kong (11.7%), and worldwide (9.6%) (4, 27) . It has been reported that for patients with SARS, old age and comorbities are more likely to be associated with a high mortality (17 20) . In patients with SARS, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 50 years was 13 times higher than for patients younger than 50 years (17) . In contrast, two of our three expired patients were younger than 50 years; such an inconsistency might be partly attributed to a small number of patients in this series, a variable virulence of the infective agent, and the immune status of the host (17, 39) .
Univariate analysis in this study revealed a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte counts and radiographic scores. Leukocytosis were observed in 61% of our patients that was most prominent on day 20 after the onset of fever, while leucopenia was found in 52% of cases that was most severe on day 10 of the illness; 91% of the patients had lymphopenia with the lowest lymphocyte count (mean: 347.97/mm 3 247.28) at a mean time of 13.7 days. The above findings were consistent with a previous report (40) . Thrombocytopenia in patients with SARS was closely related to prognosis by multivariate analysis (17) , but it was related neither to prognosis in other series (1, 2) nor to radiographic scores in our study. Actually, 55 61% of the patients with SARS had thrombocytopenia initially, and 35 49% of victims had reactive thrombocytosis in the late stage (17) . In our series, the lowest (mean 91.00/mm 3 23.06) and highest (mean 487.13/mm 3 60.52) platelet count was observed at the mean on day 16 and day 23 after the onset of fever, respectively.
Hypoxemia is the most sensitive and reliable marker of pulmonary failure. Hypoxemia occurred in 60% of our cases (mean 52.53/mmHg 13.42) that was most severe on average on day 19 (17) . However, the mean and maximal radiographic scores in this series were significantly correlated with the severity of retained arterial CO2, and the maximal radiographic scores also correlated with the degree of hypoxemia. Retained CO 2 reflects the severity of lung dysfunction when there is increase of intrapulmonary shunt; this occurred in 71% of our patients (mean 64.93/mmHg 28.73) that was most obvious on day 24. The relationship between the severity of lung change and blood gas found in this series is consistent with previous reports describing an inverse relationship between radiographic scores and the percentage of oxygen saturation, particularly at the time of maximal disease (29, 30) . The maximal percentages of the involved lung in the mortality and survival groups were significantly different (41.5% 8.6 vs 16.4% 10.0, p < 0.001) (38) .
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus particles, some with vacuolation, have been observed in myocardium, kidney, liver and spleen cells (17) . Damage to those organs was associated with elevated enzymes by a frequency of 85% for AST, 74% for ALT, 43% for LDH, 13% for creatine kinase, and 95% for C-reactive protein, as shown in our series and in previous reports (17, 20) . Higher the levels of the above enzymes are associated with the presence of lung lesions or damage to the other organs (17, 18) .
Statistical analysis in this study showed that the number of hospitalized days, the absolute lymphocyte count, and the number of days of intubation significantly correlated with the mean radiographic score. The maximal radiographic score correlated best with the percentage of lymphocytes in a leukocyte count, followed by the number of hospitalized days and the absolute lymphocyte count.. The above findings were somewhat different from findings in other series (27, 29, 32, 38) .
Our study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study dependent on data collection from case records; thus, some important information may have been ignored and the laboratory data may be incomplete. Second, the sample size in this study is small: three of the 28 (11%) patients died, and the statistical power was not strong enough to analyze prognostic factors in detail. However, the small number of cases did not affect the significant correlation between the radiographic findings and clinical parameters from a statistical point of view. Third, the mean value of clinical parameters, instead of the worst abnormal laboratory data, was used to analyze the relationship to the maximal radiographic score.
Fourth, this study only described the radiographic abnormalities in patients with SARS pneumonia; pathological changes were not elucidated by either histopathological studies or an animal model. Fifth, medical treatments such as administration of steroids, antibiotics or antiviral agents, rather than SARS, might have affected the clinical parameters and the radiographic findings.
In conclusion, this study showed that the number of hospitalized days correlated most significantly with the mean radiographic score, while the percentage of lymphocytes in a leukocyte count correlated best with the maximal radiographic score. The averages of mean and maximal radiographic scores of the patients who died, with comorbidities and without comorbidity were also significantly different. The severity of abnormalities quantified on chest radiographs in patients with SARS correlated with the clinical course and laboratory parameters.",A Correlation between the Severity of Lung Lesions on Radiographs and Clinical Findings in Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,"Wan, Yung-Liang; Tsay, Pei-Kwei; Cheung, Yun-Chung; Chiang, Ping-Cherng; Wang, Chun-Hua; Tsai, Ying-Huang; Kuo, Han-Ping; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Lin, Tzou-Yien",Korean J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627448/,247,2860,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,82b0cd320ba1e619c08fee764bec158f166fab55,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can be the cause of congenital malformations, including microcephaly in infants and can cause other disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and myelitis, which can also occur in some infected adults. However, at this time, there is no drug approved to treat ZIKV infection. Drug repurposing is the promptest way to obtain an effective drug during a global public health emergency such as the spread of Zika virus. In this study, we report a US Food and Drug Admistration-approved drug that is safe for pediatric use. Nitazoxanide and its bioactive metabolite, tizoxanide, have anti-ZIKV potential in vitro, and we identified that they exerts antiviral effect possibly by targeting the viral postattachment step.","Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first isolated in Uganda in 1947, has a positive-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome of approximately 11 000 nucleotides. Zika virus can be transmitted by Aedes spp mosquitoes and also through sexual contact, blood transfusion, urine, saliva, and vertically from mother to fetus [1] . Since a large Zika outbreak happened in Brazil in 2014, ZIKV transmission has been reported in more than 60 countries and regions globally. Although 80% of patients infected with ZIKV are asymptomatic [2] , it can lead to fetal microcephaly in pregnant women [3] , and it may increase risk of neurological disorders and myelitis in infected adults [4] . The association between ZIKV infection and testis damage was proved in a mouse model recently, arising the concern between ZIKV infection and infertility in male [5] . To protect the public health, especially to avoid birth defects, it is necessary to find a safe drug that can be taken by mouth (orally) for prophylactic and therapeutic use during an epidemic.
The advantage of drug repurposing compared with de novo drug development in a public emergency is the rapid clinical application of repurposed drugs. Based on this idea, Xu et al [6] performed a drug repurposing screening and reported that a US Food and Drug Admistration (FDA)-approved pregnancy category B anthelmintic drug called niclosamide shows anti-ZIKV effects in vitro. Barrows et al [7] also screened an FDA-approved drug library and reported a series of FDA-approved drugs capable of inhibiting ZIKV in vitro. Eyer et al [8] identified some nucleoside inhibitors that can inhibit ZIKV replication in cell culture. However, more research needs to be conducted before the above-mentioned antivirals can be clinically applied.
In this study, we report that the pediatric drug nitazoxanide, which is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent initially approved by the FDA as an antiprotozoan drug and has overwhelming safety due to extensive postmarketing experience involving almost 75 million adults and children [9] , has the potential to inhibit ZIKV infection in vitro, and we identified that it targets the postviral entry step to exert its antiviral effect.
Vero cells, Vero E6 cells, and A549 cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively). Zika virus strain SZ-WIV01 (GenBank number KU963796) was obtained from the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases (Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China). Virus stocks were propagated in Vero cells. Virus stocks were titrated by plaque-forming units (PFU) on Vero E6 cells.
Ribonucleic acid was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. Complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) was synthesized using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Ribonucleic acid was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with an Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system. Real-time PCR was performed using 2 μL of cDNA with specific primers targeting the genes of interest (β-actin, forward, AGTGTGACGTGGACATCCGCAAAG and reverse, ATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGAC; ZIKV, forward, CAACTACTGCAAGTGGAAGGGT and reverse, AAGTGGTCCATATGATCGGTTGA) and 5 μL of quantitative PCR SYBR Green real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) in a final reaction volume of 10 μL. The cycling conditions were 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 15 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (fold induction) was quantified by calculating the 2 −ΔCT value, with β-actin mRNA as an endogenous control.
Various concentrations of compounds were added to Vero cells for 3 days, and the cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The infected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature and then treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 10% fetal calf serum for 30 minutes. The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 2 hours with the monoclonal antibody against flavivirus envelope protein (clone D1-4G2-4-15; mouse; 1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA) followed by the incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Hoechst33258 dye was used to stain the nucleus. The stained cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.
Serially diluted ZIKV were inoculated into Vero E6 cells seeded in 24-well plates at 37°C for 1 hour and then were removed. The cells were then overlayed with 1.2 mL of 1.5% FBS DMEM containing 1% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC) and cultured at 37°C for 80 hours. The CMC overlay was removed, and the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for half an hour and stained with 0.05% crystal violet in 20% ethanol. Plaques were counted and expressed as PFUs per mlliliter (PFU mL −1 ).
Vero cells were lysed on ice in Radio-Immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Proteins were mixed with 5× loading buffer, subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% skim milk and incubated overnight at 4°C with a homemade anti-ZIKV capsid polyclonal antibody (capsid peptide sequence designed as MKNPKKKSGGFRIVC) and β-actin (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany). The membrane was washed 3 times with PBS-Tween and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with secondary antibodies in PBS-Tween containing 1% skim milk. The signals were analyzed by chemiluminescence using ImageQuant LAS40000mini (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA).
Zika virus with 10 μM nitazoxanide or 10 μM tizoxanide were bound to the Vero cells for 1 hour at 4°C, then washed 3 times with PBS, and ZIKV RNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) immediately after binding [10] . Zika virus with 10μM nitazoxanide or 10 μM tizoxanide were incubated for 2 hours at 4°C, then washed 3 times with PBS, and changed into 10% FBS DMEM; 72 hours later, the cells were harvested for ZIKV RNA detection with qRT-PCR assay [11] .
Pediatric clinical drug nitazoxanide and its bioactive metabolite tizoxanide were tested at serial concentrations for their ability to inhibit ZIKV proliferation in Vero cells by plaque assay (Supplementary Figure 1) . As shown in the figure, these 2 drugs inhibit virus titer in a dose-dependent manner. Nitazoxanide reduced infectious ZIKV particles by >100-fold at 10 μM, whereas tizoxanide completely abolished supernatant ZIKV proliferation at 10 μM. This inhibition was further demonstrated by immunofluorescence assay detecting the envelope protein expression ( Figure 1A ) and by Western bot detecting the ZIKV capsid protein ( Figure 1B) . No cytotoxicity was observed for these 2 drugs under assay concentrations ( Figure 1C ). We further investigated the kinetics of ZIKV propagation in the presence of these 2 drugs (Supplementary Figure 2) , and obvious inhibition was observed. In addition, both drugs inhibited intracellular ZIKV RNA production in a dose-dependent manner under different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) (Supplementary Figure 3) . To verify whether nitazoxanide and tizoxanide could inhibit ZIKV in human-derived cells, we performed antiviral experiments in A549 cells, and we found that both drugs could inhibit ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner under nontoxic doses ( Figure 1D , toxicity data not shown).
To explore the antiviral mechanism of these 2 drugs, we first investigated whether they affect the viral attachment stage by treating the Vero cells at 4°C with drugs and the ZIKV (Figure 2A ). At 4°C, the viral particles can physically bind to the cell surface without endocytosis, which occurs most efficiently at 37°C. After washing to remove the unadsorbed ZIKV, the cells were harvested for ZIKV RNA detection. Our results showed that these 2 drugs did not inhibit the attachment of ZIKV to the cells.
To further demonstrate this result, we performed a similar experiment: Vero cells were cotreated with ZIKV and 10 μM drugs at 4°C for 2 hours, after the removal of the virus/drugs and PBS washing, the cells were incubated in fresh medium without the drugs at 37°C to allow the subsequent infection to occur and ZIKV RNA were determined 72 hours later ( Figure 2B ). In consistent with the result of Figure 2A , both drugs did not inhibit the ZIKV infection, which suggests that nitazoxanide and tizoxanide do not inhibit the attachment of ZIKV to the cells.
To determine at which step these drugs may inhibit ZIKV infection, we performed a time-of-drug-addition assay by adding these drugs during or after ZIKV inoculation of Vero cells ( Figure 2C and D) . The results indicated that adding drugs at 4 hours postinfection also exerted anti-ZIKV effects with an efficiency comparable to the cotreatment, suggesting that drugs can inhibit the virus infection after the virus attachment.
The pretreatment of the cells with the compounds for 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours did not inhibit the ZIKV infection, further confirming that the compounds do not act on the ZIKV entry (Supplementary Figure 4) . In addition, we have performed a time-of-addition experiment using a high MOI. As shown in Figure 2D , addition of the compounds at 24 hours after the ZIKV infection at a MOI of 2 still potently inhibits virus infection, strongly suggesting that the drugs are capable of inhibiting established ZIKV infection, likely at a step of virus genome replication. A (H7N9). It is also reported to inhibit the replication of a broad range of other RNA and DNA viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rotavirus, norovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus, and human immunodeficiency virus [12] . Clinical trials have indicated its potential role in treating rotavirus and norovirus gastroenteritis, chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, and influenza. It is suggested that nitazoxanide may inhibit virus infection by regulating the host responses [9] . The specific mechanism may be associated with its depleting intracellular Ca 2+ stores [13] . Thiazolides were also reported to inhibit the replication of H1N1 and different other strains of influenza A virus by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin at a stage preceding resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion [14] . Our results indicate that nitazoxanide inhibits ZIKV infection by targeting the postattachment step, most likely virus genome replication. Perhaps, it also inhibits ZIKV replication by depleting intracellular Ca 2+ stores like bovine viral diarrhoea virus; however, novel mechanisms cannot be excluded in this setting, and further investigation needs to be performed.
Most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic; however, it was associated with congenital brain defects, neurological disorders, and infertility in males, which make it a global public health emergency [5] . Thus, we propose that emergent prophylactic drug use should be considered. An ideal repurposed anti-ZIKV drug should meet all of the following criteria for prophylactic use: (1) they are in class A or B of the FDA pregnancy category;
(2) they can be orally administered; (3) they have relative high C max compared with in vitro efficacy concentration after oral administration of a current available dosage form, to ensure effective plasma drug exposure; and (4) they have low permeability, or they are impermeable across placental barrier for category B drugs to ensure safety for the fetus. Luckily, nitazoxanide might be the unique drug that meets these criteria to date. It is an orally taken and pregnancy category B drug approved for adults and children above 1-year-old. The C max of plasma tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are 10. 6 μg/mL and 10.5 μg/mL, respectively, by oral administration of tablet [15] , which is a much higher than the concentration required to completely clear the virus in vitro (10 μM, 3.07 μg/mL for tizoxanide). Cytotoxicity to Vero cells was not observed at 10 μM for both drugs ( Figure 1C ). The in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of nitazoxanide does not seem as high as that recently reported for niclosamide [6] ; however, niclosamide is only marginally absorbed into blood stream after oral administration. In consideration of multidisciplinary factors, nitazoxanide may be a better anti-ZIKV drug that is worth immediate clinical research.

67,0fc5801b4cdc21c018c93aa3cbc9b601491fdeb4,"Ten years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, a second coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been identified as the cause of a highly lethal pneumonia in patients in the Middle East and in travelers from this region. Over the past 9 months, since the virus was first isolated, much has been learned about the biology of the virus. It is now clear that MERS-CoV is transmissible from person to person, and its close relationship with several bat coronaviruses suggests that these animals may be the ultimate source of the infection. However, many key issues need to be addressed, including identification of the proximate, presumably zoonotic, source of the infection, the prevalence of the infection in human populations, details regarding clinical and pathological features of the human infection, the establishment of a small rodent model for the infection, and the virological and immune basis for the severe disease observed in most patients. Most importantly, we do not know whether a MERS-CoV epidemic is likely or not. Infection with the virus has so far resulted in only 91 cases and 46 deaths (as of 29 July 2013), but it is nonetheless setting off alarm bells among public health officials, including Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, who called MERS-CoV ""a threat to the entire world."" This article reviews some of the progress that has been made and discusses some of the questions that need to be answered.
Citation Perlman S. 2013. The Middle East respiratory syndrome-how worried should we be? mBio 4(4):e00531-13.","M iddle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially isolated in September 2012 from a patient in Saudi Arabia who had developed a lethal infection characterized by pneumonia and renal failure (1) . A nearly identical virus was then isolated from a second Saudi Arabian patient with respiratory disease who had been flown to London for therapy. In retrospect, the first cases of MERS occurred in an extended family in Zarqa, Jordan, in April 2012. Virus was detected in two patients in that outbreak, but several other family members and health care workers developed respiratory disease. Virus was not isolated from these individuals. Renal failure was noted in some of the early reports, but it is not yet clear whether it was virus induced or occurred as a consequence of respiratory failure. Since those early days, several other clusters of infection have been identified, indicating that human-to-human transmission occurred, although spread may not be efficient (2) . The incubation time for patients with confirmed disease was 5.2 days (confidence interval, 1.9 to 14.7 days), according to one study (3) .
Transmission appears to occur more readily if the recipient is immunocompromised or has another comorbidity, such as diabetes. In the largest outbreak described thus far, 23 patients with laboratory-confirmed infection were followed in Al-Ahsa governorate in Saudi Arabia (3) . Diabetes mellitus (74%), end-stage renal disease (52%), and lung disease (43%) were underlying illnesses in these patients. Transmission to family members and health care workers was documented in 1 to 2% of contacts, again demonstrating preferential infection of individuals with substantial comorbidities. Unlike another human respiratory coronavirus, the one that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV has not preferentially infected health care workers. At present, it is not known if patients are able to transmit virus before the development of symptomatic respiratory disease. If this does occur, control of a large outbreak will be more difficult. The SARS epidemic was contained, in part, because the majority of patients were infectious only after they developed pneumonia.
One year after MERS first came to light, all cases have been found to have a Middle East connection, with approximately 70% occurring in Saudi Arabia. Within Saudi Arabia, the first cases were recognized in the Al-Ahsa governorate, an area located in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia, which remains the epicenter of the outbreak. Cases have been identified in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Tunisia, in all instances in patients with a history of recent travel to the Middle East (Fig. 1 ). Global travel is extremely common, so it may be just a matter of time before MERS-CoV cases are identified on all continents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published definitions of confirmed and probable cases, which provides a uniform approach to evaluating patients with suspected disease (http://www .cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html).
One important caveat is that we do not know the extent of the infection within the wider community. Since most identified patients have underlying diseases, it is possible that MERS-CoV is a common infection, at least in Saudi Arabia, and that patients without significant comorbidities develop a mild respiratory disease or remain asymptomatic. Careful epidemiological studies, which are required to address this question, are hampered by the lack of validated diagnostic tools. Knowing the number of infected humans will provide critical information about the prevalence of MERS-CoV and about the likelihood of developing severe disease.
The genome of MERS-CoV was characterized within weeks of the isolation of the virus (4). Sequence analysis shows that it shares similarities with two previously identified betacoronaviruses, namely, BtCoV-HKU4, identified in Tylonycteris bats, and BtCov-HKU5, present in Pipistrellus bats, but its closest neighbor is a betacoronavirus isolated from Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats in the Netherlands. During the 2002-2003 epidemic, SARS-CoV adapted to human populations to such an extent that it could no longer infect bat cells. (An alternative explanation is that we have not yet identified the bat species that actually served as the ultimate source for SARS-CoV and that cells from this species would be sensitive to SARS-CoV.) In contrast, MERS-CoV infects both human and bat cells, suggesting a possible direct bat-to-human route of transmission (5) . However, since it is unlikely that most infected humans had direct contact with bats, it is more probable that another animal species common on the Arabian Peninsula, such as sheep, goats, cows, or even camels, serves as the direct source for infection. In support of the latter possibility, MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detected in all dromedary camels sampled in Oman and even in a small percentage (14%) of camels in the Canary Islands (24) . Identification of animals that serve as intermediate hosts would help define human populations at risk and might also allow culling or quarantine of infected animals, a method that was used successfully in Hong Kong to decrease the load of pathogenic avian influenza A virus in domestic poultry populations (6) .
MERS-CoV is a large, positive-sense, single-stranded virus containing 30,119 nucleotides (4). The genome encodes both nonstructural and structural proteins. Replicase-associated nonstructural proteins comprise two-thirds of the genome and are translated into a large polyprotein that is then cleaved into 16 proteins. These proteins are conserved in all coronaviruses, and partly as a consequence of the intense research efforts addressed at understanding SAR-CoV, the structure and function of many of these proteins are known. The structural proteins encoded at the 3= end of the genome are the same as those found in other coronaviruses and include a nucleocapsid protein, a spike glycoprotein essential for cell entry, and two membrane proteins involved in virus assembly and structure.
Interspersed between and within these four structural proteins are five accessory proteins that are unique to MERS-CoV. Accessory proteins are encoded by all coronaviruses, are not essential for virus replication, may be structural or nonstructural, and can be deleted without affecting pathogenesis (for examples, see references 7 and 8). A few are apparently involved in facilitating virus assembly or in immunoevasion, but the functions of the others are not known (9) . MERS-CoV accessory proteins share no homology with any known host or virus protein, other than those of the closely related BtCoV-HKU4 and -HKU5 strains of bat coronavirus (4).
Remarkably, the identity of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4), was published only 6 months after the virus was first reported in the literature (10) . Both bat and human DPP4 sensitize resistant cells for infection, supporting the notion that virus could cross species from bats to infect humans (5) . DPP4, the receptor, is an ectopeptidase. Similar molecules are also used by other coronaviruses to enter cells, including human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is used by SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, and aminopeptidase N (APN), which is used by several alphacoronaviruses. The catalytic sites of hACE2, APN, and likely DPP4 are not required for virus entry (10) . Intriguingly, both hACE2 and DPP4 are shed from the cell surface (11, 12) . Loss of hACE2 results in more severe pulmonary disease, while DPP4 is a neutrophil chemorepellent (13) . Changes in DPP4 shedding that occur as a result of infection with MERS-CoV could influence the composition of the immune cell infiltrate, thereby ultimately affecting the outcome of the infection. DPP4 is also expressed on immune cells, including T cell lymphocytes (12) , and is required for optimal function of these cells, but there is no evidence yet to suggest that MERS-CoV infection of lymphocytes occurs or plays a major role in pathogenesis. Curiously, CEACAM-1, the host cell receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, is also expressed on T cells and is involved in signaling (14), but MHV does not infect T lymphocytes.
Events occurring immediately after MERS-CoV binds its DPP4 Perspective receptor appear to be similar to those reported for other coronaviruses. Cleavage of the surface glycoprotein must occur to expose the fusion peptide and to effect virus-cell membrane fusion and nucleocapsid release into the cytoplasm. Several host proteases, including cathepsin B and members of the TMPRSS family, have been implicated in this process (15) .
A notable feature of the MERS-CoV infection is that the virus does not appear to induce an interferon (IFN) or proinflammatory innate immune response in primary human airway epithelial cells or in cultured cells (16, 17) . A relative lack of IFN induction is a common feature of all coronavirus infections and may reflect both specific virus-mediated inhibition of cytoplasmic RIG-I-like sensing pathways and general evasion of cytoplasmic sensors via sequestration of viral macromolecular proteins inside membranous structures. In any case, this feature may allow MERS-CoV replication in the host prior to initiation of the immune response, contributing to enhanced virus levels and poor outcomes. On the other hand, MERS-CoV is more sensitive to IFN treatment than are other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, suggesting a possible therapeutic intervention in infected patients (16, 17) .
The number of MERS-CoV-infected individuals is low, the availability of clinical samples is limited, and no autopsies have been reported. It is therefore crucial to begin development of an animal model for MERS, but thus far, experimental infection has been reported only in rhesus macaques (18) . MERS-CoV-infected macaques develop a nonfatal mild pneumonia. The absence of severe respiratory disease and kidney disease in these nonhuman primates makes it imperative that additional animal models be developed. Thus far, there have been no reports of successful infection of mice or ferrets, but infection of these animals may be initiated or enhanced if the receptor for the virus, human DPP4, is expressed in lieu of the mouse protein. Notably, similar efforts to introduce the human receptor for SARS-CoV resulted in a transgenic mouse that developed an overwhelming neuronal infection (19, 20) . These mice were useful for studies of vaccines and antiviral therapies but not for studies of pathogenesis. As mice engineered to express human DPP4 are developed, it will be important to minimize the likelihood of brain infection by careful attention to tissue-specific expression.
One year after the first case was identified, the total number of MERS cases remains low, with fewer than 100 cases reported. However, this is no reason for complacency. First, the virus has already spread from Saudi Arabia to Europe and is likely to spread throughout the world as infected patients travel for medical and other reasons. Second, human-to-human transmission, initially considered to be a minor component of the disease process, has been documented in family and hospital settings. Early reports suggested that virus spread primarily to patients with underlying medical conditions, but recent documentation of spread to healthy persons, including health care workers, means that wider populations are at risk. This is a particular concern in Saudi Arabia, which is both the primary site of MERS infection and the destination for the Hajj, the yearly pilgrimage in which several million Muslims travel to Mecca. Last year's Hajj did not result in an increase in MERS cases, and it is some comfort that Mecca is located across the country from the governorate of Al-Ahsa. However, large numbers of individuals will again make the Hajj this year in mid-October, a scenario that creates a substantial risk for widespread infection.
Third, like other coronaviruses, MERS-CoV may mutate to better adapt to human populations. Coronaviruses, unlike other RNA viruses, possess proofreading capabilities that enhance genome fidelity (21) . However, the 2002-2003 epidemic made it clear that the SARS virus was able to rapidly adapt to infection of human populations (22) . Mutations were detected throughout the SARS virus genome, but they appear to be most concentrated in the region of the surface glycoprotein involved in binding to the hACE2 molecule. There is every reason to suspect that MERS-CoV will undergo similar mutations that enhance both transmissibility between humans and replication within infected individuals.
At this point, while the number of infected individuals is low, it is important to determine the extent and source of the infection. This information not only will provide a framework for establishing the relative importance of the disease and the potential for epidemic spread, but it may also facilitate direct interventions to eliminate reservoirs of infection. These analyses will require wellvalidated diagnostic reagents and access to human and animal blood samples in Al-Ahsa governorate in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East.
A second major goal will be to better understand the unique features of MERS. Does the high mortality rate reflect infection primarily of patients with substantial comorbidities? Does lack of recognition by host innate immune sensors result in high levels of virus in the lung and a dysregulated immune response, as occurred in patients with SARS? Does MERS-CoV inhibit interferon induction by novel mechanisms not utilized by other coronaviruses? Do the accessory proteins have novel mechanisms of action?
Third, development of a useful animal model that reproduces some of the features of the human infection will be critical for testing antiviral therapies and vaccines. A fourth goal will be to develop MERS-CoV-specific drugs and vaccines. The public health community learned a great deal from the SARS epidemic about approaches to treatment and prevention that might be effective against MERS-CoV.
Arguably, the most important outcome will be the development of drugs or vaccines that target a broad array of coronaviruses and not just a single virus. Events over the past 10 years show that coronaviruses are not only widespread in nature but also able to cross species to infect new hosts and can cause severe disease in humans. Having tools in hand before such events occur is critical for public health.",The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome—How Worried Should We Be?,"Perlman, Stanley",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747588/,257,2257,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,b16173612f53649fbd4db78654874bee5d4d607f,"The vacuolar aTpase (V-aTpase) plays an important role in tumor progression and metastases. a novel peptide from the a2 isoform of V-aTpase called a2NTD has been shown to exert an immunoregulatory role in the tumor microenvironment by controlling the maturation of monocytes toward a tumor-associated macrophage phenotype. Our data indicate that a2NTD binds to the surface of monocytes. a2NTD was preferentially endocytosed by pro-inflammatory monocytes bearing a cD142 + cD16 + phenotype, which is associated with the monocyte-to-macrophage maturation process. Both a2NTD binding and internalization led to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β by cD142 + cD16 − (classical) and cD142 + cD16 + (intermediate) monocytes. a2NTD was internalized via a macropinocytosis mechanism utilizing scavenger receptors. however, the inhibition of a2NTD endocytosis did not reduce cytokine production by monocytes. This points to the existence of two receptors that respond to a2NTD: scavengers receptors that mediate cellular uptake and an hitherto unidentified receptor stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines.
Abbreviations: a2NTD, N-terminus domain of the a2 isoform vacuolar ATPase; a2V, a2 isoform vacuolar ATPase;
CRI, cancer-related inflammation; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; V-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase","Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) are multi-protein complexes found on the surface of tumor cells. 1,2 V-ATPases impact on tumorigenesis at they acidify the extracellular environment via their proton pumping activity. This enables the maturation of pH-sensitive degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which promote tumor metastasis. 3, 4 Increased cell surface expression of V-ATPases has indeed been linked to tumor cell invasion. 5 Tumor cells secrete cytokines and other proteins that dictate various facets of the immune response that they will generate, including the activation and polarization of specific macrophage and neutrophil subsets. 6, 7 Cytokines such as interferon γ (IFNγ) skew macrophages toward a classically activated phenotype called M1, which participates in tumor destruction. In contrast, cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-10 promote the maturation of alternatively activated M2 macrophages. 8, 9 The M2 phenotype promotes tumor survival by favoring proliferation and tumor progression, 10 as well as by stimulating angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. 11 M2 macrophages promote extracellular matrix remodeling 12 while at the same time regulating a complex chemokine network. 13 Blood monocytes are generally viewed as a heterogeneous population of cells that constitute the precursors to tissue macrophages. Monocytes are differentiated based on the cell surface expression of two markers: the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein CD14 and the Fcγ receptor CD16. In 2010, the nomenclature was modified to include three subtypes of monocytes based on these two markers. Classical monocytes display a CD14 ++ CD16 − phenotype and represent 80-90% of all monocytes. The minor populations consist of CD14 ++ CD16 + (intermediate) and CD14 + CD16 ++ (non-classical) monocytes. 14 Monocytes expressing both CD14 and CD16 show a more mature morphological and functional phenotype than their CD16 − counterparts and are thought to constitute the specific precursors of tissue-resident macrophages. 15 Our studies use this new classification system, however many of the references use the old nomenclature and so will be referred to as originally published.
kinetics. In addition, a2NTD was preferentially endocytosed by CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes and these cells produced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), as compared with CD14 ++ CD16 − monocytes. The endocytosis of a2NTD occurred via a macropinocytosis mechanism that required actin filament and microtubule polymerization. Blocking a2NTD endocytosis had no effects on the intracellular levels of IL-1. Taken together, these data suggest that a2NTD stimulates monocytes to generate pro-inflammatory cytokines via a receptor-mediated mechanism. This putative receptor represents a potential point of intervention that can be further investigated to prevent the maturation of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).
a2NTD binds and enters monocytes in a dose-and temperature-dependent manner. The binding of a2NTD was investigated in PBMCs using a fluorescently labeled variant of the peptide. a2NTD bound monocytes in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 1A) . At the highest concentrations of a2NTD, approximately 90% of monocytes were found to interact with a2NTD ( Fig. 1B) . Lymphocytes were also examined, exhibiting minimal binding of a2NTD, though at the highest concentration of a2NTD tested approximately 30% of lymphocytes were positive (Fig. 1B) . Binding specificity was tested in a competition assay. Unlabeled a2NTD was able to compete out the binding of fluorescent a2NTD in both monocytes ( Fig. 1C and D) and lymphocytes (Fig. 1D) .
Many cellular functions including receptor-mediated internalization are inhibited at 4°C, implying that these conditions Recently, we have demonstrated a novel role for the a2 isoform of V-ATPase (a2V) in tumor progression. Thus, the N-terminal region of a2V expressed at the plasma membrane of human tumor cells can be cleaved, resulting in the release of a peptide that activates immune cells. 16 When incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), this peptide (a2NTD) causes monocytes to produce IL-1β. 17, 18 A more detailed investigation revealed that a2NTD induces primary monocytes to develop an IL-12 low IL-23 low IL-10 high M2-like phenotype. 16 Thus, a2NTD was the first cytokine-like factor described to induce the alternative activation pathway in macrophages.
In the present study, we examined the interaction of a2NTD with human monocytes. In particular, we determined binding specificity, which particular monocyte subset is targeted, the mode of cellular entry and the receptors involved. a2NTD bound to monocytes and binding could be competed out with unlabeled peptide. a2NTD was internalized by monocytes and THP-1 cells, though the latter demonstrated slower uptake (A and B) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pBMcs) fixed with paraformaldehyde were incubated with 0.1-10 μg/mL a2NTD conjugated to alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-aF488). cell populations were gated based on forward/side scatter. Representative histograms showing a2NTD-aF488 binding in monocytes are presented in (A); the black peak refers to unstained cells. In (B), the percentage of a2NTD binding to monocytes and lymphocytes is shown (means ± seM, n = 4). (C and D) pBMcs fixed with paraformaldehyde were incubated with 0.1-10 μg/mL unconjugated a2NTD and then with 2 μg/mL a2NTD-aF488. a representative histogram showing competitive inhibition of a2NTD binding to monocytes is reported in (C); the black histogram refers to unstained cells. In (D), the percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes positive for a2NTD binding after competitive assay are shown. Values were normalized to cells that did not receive unlabeled a2NTD. (means ± seM, n = 4). (E) pBMcs were incubated with a2NTD-aF488 for indicated time at 4°c and 37°c. some of the samples were then treated with 0.1% trypsin-eDTa (dashed lines) for 5 min to remove surface bound a2NTD. cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry, upon gating on cD14 + events. (means ± seM, n = 8). The percentage of positive monocytes (black lines) or lymphocytes (gray lines) after a2NTD-aF488 incubation is reported. were pre-incubated at 4°c or 37°c for 30 min, followed by the addition of 10 μg/mL a2NTD conjugated to alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-aF488) for 1 h and staining with an anti-cD14 pe-Texas red antibody for 30 min. some of the samples were treated with 0.1% trypsin after a2NTD-aF488 incubation to remove surface bound a2NTD. cells were then placed on slides using a cytospin and imaged using a Nikon fluorescent microscope. Representative images from three independent experiments are shown: pBMcs incubated at 4°c, followed (A) or not (B) by trypsin treatment; pBMc incubated at 37°c, followed (C) or not (D) by trypsin treatment. maintained at 4°C displayed reduced surface fluorescence (Fig. 2B) . In comparison, trypsin-treated cells cultured at 37°C exhibited a reduced surface staining but maintained the punctuate intracellular staining (Fig. 2D) . To eliminate non-specific phagocytosis as a mechanism of cellular uptake, neutrophils were separately examined. Neutrophils demonstrated much less endocytosis of a2NTD than monocytes, but slightly more than lymphocytes (Fig. S1) . Finally, the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was also examined. While the uptake trend is similar in THP-1 cells and monocytes, the kinetics are much slower for the former. Indeed, after 2h at 37°C, only 17% of THP-1 cells were positive as compared with almost 75% of monocytes ( Fig. 1E and Fig. S2 ). Endocytosis of a2NTD is energy-dependent and requires structural proteins. In general, filamentous actin is required for receptor-mediated endocytosis. 20 The requirement for microtubules depends on the specific receptor that is involved. For example, the inhibition of microtubules blocks complement receptor-mediated, but not Fc receptor-mediated, particle internalization. 21, 22 Moreover, the addition of microtubule-depolymerizing agents such as nocodazole slows down adsorptive and fluid-phase endocytosis. 23, 24 In order to determine if actin or microtubules are important for a2NTD internalization, PBMCs were cultured with a2NTD in presence of cytochalasin D (CytoD), to inhibit F-actin filaments, and colchicines, to inhibit microtubules.
Monocytes demonstrated a greater uptake of a2NTD as compared with a negative control peptide. The pretreatment of PBMCs with inhibitors of actin and microtubules resulted in decreased fluorescence, demonstrating an inhibition of a2NTD uptake (Fig. 3A) . Both inhibitors significantly reduced a2NTD entry by approximately 80% as compared with control cells ( Fig. 3B and C) . Actin and tubulin monomers are in the active state for polymerization when bound to ATP and GTP respectively. The pretreatment of PBMCs with metabolic inhibitors such as sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose (that deplete the intracellular ATP pool) or mycophenolic acid (that depletes the pool of GTP) also decreased the uptake of a2NTD (Fig. 3D) .
Uptake of a2NTD by monocyte subsets. To determine if different monocyte subsets preferentially internalize a2NTD, monocytes were stained for the surface markers CD14 and CD16 after incubation with a2NTD. CD14 ++ CD16 − cells constitute the majority of all monocytes, while CD14 ++ CD16 + and CD14 + CD16 ++ represent two minor subpopulations. 25 We were able to retrieve these three populations by flow cytometry ( Table 1) . Of note, nearly 100% of CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes were positive for a2NTD endocytosis, as compared are ideal for studying binding in the absence of internalization. Conversely, both binding and internalization can occur at 37°C. 19 The temperature-dependent binding of fluorescent a2NTD to PBMC was determined at 4°C and 37°C, to confirm an internalization mechanism. There were more a2NTDpositive monocytes, as assessed by flow cytometry, at 37°C (75%) than at 4°C (15%) (Fig. 1E) . Cells were then treated with trypsin to remove any a2NTD bound to the cell surface. Thus, while trypsin reduced the number of a2NTD-positive cells in both temperature conditions, an increased number of fluorescent cells persisted at 37°C. Lymphocytes, which showed minimal binding to a2NTD, also exhibited minimal peptide uptake (Fig. 1E) .
Endocytosis was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. After incubation with fluorescent a2NTD, monocytes were examined by fluorescence microscopy, showing a2NTD-dependent surface staining at 4°C ( Fig. 2A) and a more intense and intracellular punctate staining at 37°C (Fig. 2C) . Similar to what was observed with flow cytometry, trypsin-treated monocytes incubated with a control peptide, a2NTD conjugated to alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-aF488) alone, or a2NTD-aF488 after the indicated inhibitors. cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry, upon gating on cD14 + event. (B and C) pBMcs were pre-treated with actin and microtubule inhibitors for 1 h followed by the exposure to 10 μg/mL a2NTD-aF488 for 1 h. Representative histograms for each inhibitor are shown in (B). Dashed line depicts cells incubated with a2NTD-aF488 alone, while solid lines refer to cells exposed to inhibitors plus a2NTD. (C) Bar graph values in c illustrate the percentage of a2NTD-positive cells after inhibitor treatment. (means ± seM, n = 5, **p < 0.001, compared with a2NTD alone). (D) pBMcs were cultured in glucose-free media with or without NaN 3 and 2-deoxyglucose (to deplete aTp) or mycophenolic acid (to deplete GTp) for 2 h at 37°c, followed by the administration of a2NTD-aF488 for 1 h. columns report mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values (means ± seM, n = 5, *p < 0.05, compared with a2NTD alone).
To determine if a2NTD enhances macropinocytosis, PBMCs were incubated with a fluid-phase macropinocytosis marker, 10 kDa neutral dextran, in combination with increasing concentrations of a2NTD. Consistent with the observation of others, 27 dextran was efficiently taken up by macropinocytosis at 37°C. Of note, a2NTD induced a significant dose-dependent increase in the uptake of fluid-phase dextran (Fig. 5D) . DMA pre-treatment significantly reduced dextran internalization as triggered by a2NTD. As THP-1 cells exhibited slower kinetics of a2NTD uptake, we investigated whether THP-1 cells bear a defective macropinocytosis machinery. When THP-1 cells were incubated with fluorescence 10 kDa dextran, cell fluorescence at 37°C with approximately 45% of CD14 ++ CD16 − monocytes. The CD14 + CD16 ++ population showed a a2NTD uptake profile similar to that of CD14 ++ CD16 − cells (Fig. 4A) .
a2NTD stimulates IL-1α and IL-1β production. It has previously been shown that a2NTD stimulates monocytes to produce the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β. 17, 18 We examined whether a particular subset of monocytes is responsible for the production of inflammatory cytokines following a2NTD stimulation. To this aim, monocytes were incubated with a2NTD and then stained for surface CD14 and CD16 expression, followed by staining for the intracellular cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β and TNF-α.
Only CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes showed a statistically significant increase in IL-1α, production when compared with cells maintained in control conditions (Fig. 4B) . Both CD14 ++ CD16 − and CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes produced significantly higher amounts of IL-1β (Fig. 4C) . There was no significant difference in the production of TNFα by cells treated with a2NTD and control cells (Fig. 4D) . Of note, the CD14 ++ CD16 + subpopulation invariably produced higher amounts of IL-1α, IL-1β and TNFα than the other two subpopulations. In addition, the intracellular levels of IL-1α and IL-1β were greater than those of TNFα. This finding is consistent with our previous data demonstrating that monocytes produce more IL-1 than TNF. 16 LPS contamination of the recombinant peptide is always a concern when investigating inflammatory cytokines. A multiexperimental approach was used to investigate the presence of LPS contamination, including the Limulus assay and polymyxin B neutralization tests. The results (which have previously been published) demonstrated negligible levels of LPS and that cytokine secretion could not be inhibited by pre-treatment with polymyxin B. 16 Endocytosis of a2NTD occurs via macropinocytosis. To study the mechanism by which a2NTD is internalized, we examined three common pathways of cellular entry: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. 26 To rhis aim, PBMCs were pre-treated with distinct compounds that inhibit each of these pathways, followed by incubation with a2NTD. Chloropromazine (CPZ) and dynasore were used to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Neither of these inhibitors had an effect on a2NTD uptake (Fig. 5A) . Filipin and nystatin were used to inhibit caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Similar to the inhibitors of clathrinmediated endocytosis, filipin and nystatin did not affect a2NTD entry (Fig. 5B) . Rottlerin and dimethylamiloride (DMA) were used to inhibit macropinocytosis. In contrast to the other inhibitors, both DMA and rottlerin significantly inhibited the uptake of a2NTD. In particular, rottlerin inhibited a2NTD uptake by 63% and DMA by 83% (Fig. 5C) . unknown. There is evidence suggesting that scavenger receptors utilize macropinocytosis as one mode of cellular entry. 29, 30 Scavenger receptors recognize macromolecules with negative charges 31 as well as lipoproteins. 32 Previous findings indicate that a2NTD is associated with lipids 33 and the amino acid sequence of a2NTD carries a net negative change. We therefore examined whether scavenger receptors play a part in the endocytosis of a2NTD.
Polyinosinic acid (polyI), a polyanionic nucleotide, is a commonly used scavenger receptor ligand. PBMCs were pre-treated with polyanionic inhibitors before the addition of a2NTD and polyI significantly reduced a2NTD uptake by 80%, as compared with untreated samples (Fig. 6A) . Polyadenylic acid and polycytidylic acid, structural homologs of polyI, did not inhibit a2NTD uptake.
Endocytosis is not required for cytokine production by a2NTD. We have previously shown a2NTD to upregulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We wanted then to determine if the internalization of a2NTD is required for cytokine production or if a2NTD binding is sufficient. After preincubation with trafficking inhibitors and a2NTD stimulation, monocytes were stained for intracellular IL-1β. None of the inhibitors had a statistically significant effect on IL-1β production (Fig. 6B) . This indicates that the binding of a2NTD to monocytes is sufficient to stimulate a pro-inflammatory secretory response.
TAMs are considered critical perpetuators of the low grade inflammation that is required to maintain tumor survival. The a2NTD peptide has been shown to stimulate monocytes to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. 17, 18 In addition, a2NTD induces the expression of cytokines linked to M2 TAMs, which help in preventing immune cells from recognizing tumors.
To further characterize the interaction between monocytes and a2NTD, we are interested in determining the receptor(s) increased similar to that of monocytes. The macropinocytotic response of THP-1 cells was also sensitive to DMA. However, while the co-administration of a2NTD slightly increased dextran uptake by THP-1 cells, this was not significant (Fig. S2B) . Overall, the fluorescence intensity of dextran-treated THP-1 cells were 67% less than that of monocytes. a2NTD uptake occurs via scavenger receptors. Scavenger receptors are recognized as key components of the innate immune system, 28 but the mechanism by which they signal remains (A-C) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pBMcs) were pre-incubated with the indicated trafficking inhibitors for 1 h at 37°c followed by the administration of 10 μg/mL a2NTD conjugated to alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-aF488) for 1 additional h. cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry, upon gating on cD14 + events. Representative histograms for each trafficking inhibitor are reported. Dashed lines refer to cells incubated with a2NTD-aF488 alone, while solid lines depict cells incubated with trafficking inhibitor plus a2NTD. Bar graphs depict a2NTD-positive cells for clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitors (A), caveolin-mediated endocytosis inhibitors (B) and macropinocytosis inhibitors (C) (means ± seM, n = 8, #p < 0.001, compared with a2NTD alone). (D) pBMcs were preincubated at 4°c or 37°c with 50 μg/mL 10 kDa dextran conjugated to alexa Fluor 647 for 30 min. some of the samples also received dimethylamiloride (DMa) for 30 min. Unconjugated a2NTD was then added (1-100 ng/mL) for 1 h at 37°c. followed by flow cytometry for the quantification of dextran-associated fluorescence. columns report mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values (means ± seM, n = 4, *p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, compared with cells maintained at 37°c, **p < 0.001, compared with cells receiving the same amount of a2NTD without DMa).
ROS may be a redundant amplification signal to produce additional inflammatory cytokines. THP-1 cells seem not to express this putative receptor to sufficient levels and thus cannot produce ROS in response to a2NTD.
The inhibition of a2NTD endocytosis with polyI ( Fig. 6A) indicates that a scavenger receptor is involved in a2NTD internalization. Scavenger receptors are a broad family of integral membrane proteins that mediate the cellular binding and internalization of an extraordinarily wide range of negatively charged macromolecules including lipoproteins, 34 polyribonucleotides (such as polyI) 35 and advanced-glycation end products. 36 Macrophage have been well characterized in their expression of scavenger receptors, especially linked to their pathological role in atherosclerotic plaques. 37 The a2NTD peptide carries a net negative charge at physiological pH. In addition, the a2 N-terminal domain exhibit physicochemical properties that are compatible with its integration in membranes. 33 Hence, it is not surprising that scavenger receptors would mediate the endocytosis of a2NTD. CD14 + CD16 − monocytes have been shown to be generally more phagocytic than their CD14 + CD16 + counterparts. 38 that interacts with a2NTD. While a2NTD binds to the cell surface and enters both monocytes and THP-1 cells, the former bind higher amounts of a2NTD and internalize the peptide at a much faster pace than the latter (Fig. 1E and Fig. S2A ). This would suggest that THP-1 cells may express reduced amounts of the proteins that are necessary for a2NTD binding and internalization.
Our previous studies have shown that a2NTD stimulates both monocytes and THP-1 cells to produce IL-1β. However, only monocytes (but not THP-1 cells) generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon a2NTD stimulation. 16 This is consistent with the concept that THP-1 cells express less or lack some of the proteins that mediate the endocytosis of a2NTD. Monocytes stimulated with a2NTD in the presence of trafficking inhibitors produced pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that the entry of a2NTD is not necessary for cytokine production (Fig. 6B) . Taken together, these data suggest a possible dual receptor process. Thus, while both monocytes and THP-1 cells appear to express the a2NTD receptor that is important for IL-1β secretion, only monocytes have a second receptor that brings a2NTD into the cell and leads to intracellular ROS production. In monocytes, Figure 6 . Inhibition of a2NTD endocytosis by scavenger receptor inhibitors. (A and B) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pBMcs) were pre-incubated with the indicated inhibitors for 1 h at 37°c followed by incubation with 10 μg/mL a2NTD conjugated to alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-aF488) for 1 h. cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry, upon gating on cD14 + events.

Mononuclear isolation and cell culture. These studies were approved by the University institutional review board. After informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, peripheral blood was collected into sodium heparin vacutainers (Thermo Fisher, 026853B). The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction was collected after differential density centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Thermo Fisher, 45-001-750). The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was purchased from ATCC (TIB-202) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Invitrogen, 15240096) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Routine mycoplasma testing was conducted using the MycoAlert assay from Lonza (LT07-318, LT07-518). A concentration of 1 × 10 6 PBMCs or THP-1 cells was used for all experiments.
Flow cytometry. All samples analyzed by flow cytometry were run on an LSRII flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). FlowJo software was used for data analysis (TreeStar).
Fluorescence microscopy. A Shandon cytospin 2 (Thermo Scientific) was used to spin stained cells onto microscope slides. The ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen, P-36935) was used as mounting medium and slides were left overnight at room temperature to allow mounting media to fix. Slides were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope and images were acquired with a Photometrics CoolSNAP ES camera. Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) was used for analysis. Adobe Photoshop version CS2 was used for figure arrangement.
Dose and competition assay. PBMCs were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min and washed twice in PBS. Cells were then incubated with a2NTD-AF488 at the indicated concentrations for 1 h on ice to prevent endocytosis. For competition assays, cells were incubated with unconjugated a2NTD for 1 h at increasing concentrations. Conjugated 20 μg/mL a2NTD was then added for 1 h on ice. For both assays, cells were washed twice in PBS after incubations before analyzing via flow cytometry.
Time and temperature assays. Unfixed PBMCs were incubated with 10 μg/mL a2NTD-AF488 for indicated time points at 37°C or 4°C. Half the samples were then treated with 0.1% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma Aldrich T-4049) for 5 min at room temperature to remove surface bound a2NTD followed by two washes in PBS. Cells were stained with anti-CD14 Pacific Blue for 30 min on ice and then washed followed by fixation with 2% PFA. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy.
ATP and GTP depletion assay. PBMCs were incubated in glucose-free RPMI medium (Invitrogen, 11879-020) with 8 mM 2-deoxy-glucose 45 and 20 mM sodium azide 45 (to deplete ATP) or 0.5 μg/mL mycophenolic acid 46 (to deplete GTP) for 2 h at Here, we demonstrate a preferential uptake of a2NTD by CD14 ++ CD16 + , suggesting that a relatively specific process is taking place as opposed to unspecific phagocytosis. We have previously implicated a2NTD in promoting the development of a TAM phenotype and CD14 + CD16 + monocytes are thought to constitute macrophage precursors. 15 This is another piece of evidence indicating the internalization of a2NTD is a specific receptor-mediated process.
An interesting finding is the characterization of the monocyte subsets that produce cytokines in response to a2NTD stimulation. CD14 + CD16 + monocytes have previously been characterized as the main producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines 39, 40 in an LPS stimulation model. However, both CD14 ++ CD16 − and CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes produce significant amounts of IL-1 in response to a2NTD (Fig. 4) . CD14 + CD16 + monocytes are also a major source of TNFα upon LPS stimulation. 41 In contrast, there is no significant TNFα production after the administration of a2NTD to these cells. Previous data indicate that the production of IL-1 is privileged over that of TNFα after a2NTD stimulation. The data presented here are consistent with these findings. While CD14 + CD16 + monocytes have been extensively studied for their role in infectious diseases and inflammation, 42 their role in tumorigenesis has only recently been explored. 43, 44 The interaction of CD14 ++ CD16 − monocytes with a2NTD, stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines represents a new area of research for how the monocyte subsets are functionally defined.
In summary, the a2NTD peptide may play a prominent role in the tumor microenvironment. While functioning to promote a localized pro-inflammatory reaction, a2NTD also prevents immune surveillance, and the interaction of a2NTD with specific monocyte subsets appears to stimulate their pro-tumorigenic functions. Our data indicate there is more than one cell type responding to a2NTD. Identifying the receptor(s) of a2NTD as well as understanding the differences among different types of a2NTD-sensitive cells will perhaps drive the development of novel anticancer therapies.
Reagents and antibodies. Recombinant a2NTD was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and subjected to endotoxin removal column chromatography (Proteome Resources). Recombinant a2NTD was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-AF488) via a microscale labeling kit (Invitrogen, A30006). Conjugation of a2NTD to AF488 was kept within a range of 1-3 mol of dye per mol of a2NTD. A scrambled peptide conjugated to FITC was used as a negative control.

Paraformaldehyde ampules were from Thermo Scientific (PI28908). Anti-CD14 D22914) and 0.1 ng/mL, 1.0 ng/mL, or 10 ng/mL a2NTD for 1 h at 4°C or 37°C. To confirm that macropinocytosis was taking place, cells were pre-incubated with dimethylamiloride for 30 min at 37°C and then treated with 10 kDa neutral dextran Alexa Fluor 647. To remove surface bound dextran, cells were treated with 0.1% trypsin-EDTA and the cells were then fixed in 2% PFA followed by two washes in PBS and then analyzed by flow cytometry.
Cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. PBMCs and primary monocytes were incubated with different concentrations of trafficking inhibitors for indicated times. Cell viability was measured via two different assays: an ATP (G7570) and a NADH assay (G8080). Cellular toxicity was measured by using a live vs. dead cell proteases assay (G9201). All three kits were conducted following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Digitonin, a detergent, was used as a positive control (Sigma, D141).
Statistical analyses. The Student's paired t-test was used to compare two groups. If more than two groups were being compared, repeated measures ANOVA was applied. Results are reported as means ± SEM and significance was defined as indicated in figure legends. Results were analyzed using Sigma Plot 11 (Systat Software Inc.).

70,7048d2fc8e7a1daab3747ea6d2257a874a9723b0,"Antibodies to Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using E. cuniculi PTP2 recombinant protein from serum samples that had been collected from a total of 295 cats in Japan. Of these samples, 6.1% (18/295) had antibodies against E. cuniculi, which included 6.3% (6/96) of the male cats and 6.0% (12/199) of the female cats. The incidence was slightly higher in feral cats (8.3%, 11/132) compared to domesticated cats (4.3%, 7/163). This suggests the possibility that the cats of our country have become a reservoir of E. cuniculi. This study is the first to demonstrate the prevalence of E. cuniculi infection in cats in Japan.","Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) is an obligate intracellular microsporidian parasite and infects a wide range of mammalian hosts, such as rabbits, rodents, dogs and humans [10, 11, 15] . E. cuniculi is an opportunistic pathogen in human patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other immunocompromised people [3, 8] . Infected animals are arguably the reservoirs of human encephalitozoonosis [3] . Encephalitozoonosis is commonly observed in rabbits, and therefore, clinical assessment and diagnosis is well established in this species [8] . Although infections due to E. cuniculi are not common in cats, E. cuniculi infections have been reported to occur in cats abroad [2, 8, 14] . One author reported that the potential role of cats in the transmission of the infectious agent cannot be excluded [14] . In Japan, a seroepidemiological survey of E. cuniculi infection in domesticated dogs and domesticated rabbits has been performed [7, 16] , but the prevalence of E. cuniculi infections in cats has not been reported. E. cuniculi in subclinically infected cats may represent a reservoir and potential risk for immunocompromised patients [11, 12] . The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of E. cuniculi in cats in Japan to serve as baseline epidemiologic data and a potential source of microsporidial infection in Japan. In addition, we compared the seropositive rate of domesticated cats with feral cats.
Furthermore, we examined four infectious diseases including Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), Feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immuno-deficiency virus (FIV) that are major diseases of the cat and compared the seroprevalence in feral cats and domesticated cats.
Serum samples were collected from 295 cats that were brought in for surgical neutering to a private animal hospital in the Nagano Prefecture in Japan from September 2011 to September 2012. On examination, there were no clinical signs. The living environment of the examined cats was investigated by questioning the owners, and cats were classified into two groups: feral cats (i.e., no owner, lives outdoors) or domesticated cats (i.e., lives indoors and sometimes outdoors). The age was unidentified because not managed breeding environment. Serum samples were stored at −30°C prior to serological examination. Animal experimentation protocols (e.g., epidemiology investigation) were approved by the president of Kitasato University in accordance with the judgment of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kitasato University (Towada, Japan; approval no. 15-064).
Testing for antibodies against E. cuniculi was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with glutathione S-transferase fusion polar tube protein 2 as the antigen [16] . Individual cat serum samples diluted to 1:400 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-feline immunoglobulin G antibody (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, U.S.A.) diluted to 1:10,000 were used as the first and second antibodies, respectively.
Testing for antibodies against T. gondii was performed using a commercial latex agglutination test kit (Toxotest, Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Tests for antibodies against FCoV were performed using a previously published ELISA protocol with feline infectious peritonitis virus solubilization antigen as the antigen [17] . Tests for FeLV antigen and FIV antibody were performed using a commercial assay kit (SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo; IDEXX Laboratories, West- The overall seropositive rate to E. cuniculi was 6.1% (18/295), which included 6.3% (6/96) of the male cats and 6.0% (12/199 ) of the female cats; the incidence in feral cats (8.3%, 11/132) was slightly higher than in domesticated cats (4.3%, 7/163) ( Table 1) . This was not statistically significant. Moreover, 20.0% (59/295) were seropositive to T. gondii, 23.7% (70/295) to FCoV, 2.4% (7/295) to FeLV and 10.5% (31/295) to FIV. Toxoplasma gondii and FIV seropositive rates were 31.8% and 16.7%, respectively, in feral cats and 10.4% and 5.5%, respectively, in domesticated cats. The FIV seropositivity was significantly higher in males (15.6%) than in females (8.0%) ( Table 2 ). The association between E. cuniculi positive samples and the positive samples of four major infectious diseases was assessed, however, this was not significant E. cuniculi infects a wide range of mammalian hosts, including humans [3] . In animals, the main target organs are the central nervous system and the kidney, which can result in a granulomatous encephalitis and nephritis [12] . The life cycle of E. cuniculi is simple and direct and, like other microsporidia, involves a proliferative merogonic stage, followed by a sporogonic stage resulting in rupture of the host cell and release of small (1.5 × 2.5 µm), environmentally resistant, infective spores [12] . Spores can survive for many months in humid environments [9] . However, the natural mechanisms of E. cuniculi transmission are not fully understood. It is believed that the disease is spread horizontally in breeding with larger numbers of animals by the fecal-oral route, but above all, along the oro-urinal pathway [4] . Vertical, transplacental transmission of the infection may also play a key role in the epidemiology and pathogenesis, especially in carnivores and rodents [6, 13] . However, little is known about the occurrence of E. cuniculi in wildlife [12] .
In cats, clinical disease is reportedly rare [12] . Infections with E. cuniculi occur in subclinically infected cats and may represent a reservoir and potential risk for immunocompromised patients and animals [7, 8] .
In our study, serum samples of 295 cats were examined for the presence of antibodies against E. cuniculi. Though there were no clinical signs on general inspection, we found 6.1% of cats in Japan that had E. cuniculi antibodies (Table  1) . A seroprevalence of 24% (17/72) of cats has been reported in Eastern Slovakia [4] , and a recent study in Virginia, U.S.A., found a seroprevalence of 6.5% (15/232) [5] . These differences may reflect the different habitats where samples were obtained and the level of exposure to other sources of infection [12] . Furthermore, it has been reported that there are no sex differences in the prevalence of E. cuniculi [1] , and the results of our study agree.
In our study, E. cuniculi seropositivity was not significantly different in domesticated cats compared to feral cats. This result may reflect the habitat of cats from which samples were obtained and that samples were not obtained from cats that resided completely indoor. On the other hand, it is reported that wildlife species have the potential to be significant reservoirs of infection for both domesticated animals and humans [12] . Furthermore, previous studies have sequenced a mouse strain in cats, indicating that the mouse may be a reservoir for infection in cats [1] . In a previous study, seroprevalence investigations in Japan revealed E. cuniculi infection in feral rodents [18] . In addition, we found 8.3% of feral cats in Japan that had E. cuniculi antibodies. In the cats of Japan, the mouse can be regarded as one of the important source of E. cuniculi infection.
In conclusion, this is the first report of E. cuniculi infection in cats in Japan. This suggests the possibility that the cats of our country have become a reservoir of E. cuniculi. This result indicates the importance of performing screening examinations of animals with the aim of reducing or halting of the spread of this disease. To further elucidate the route of infection, further studies are needed including the distribution of E. cuniculi infection in cats in Japan, other potential hosts or to discover the mouse strain of infection in cats by sequencing.

71,3c0c493a037dacafd2eda2e37518e0f0dff7955f,"We describe futures of ICU admission, demographic characteristics, treatment and outcome for critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed and suspected infection with the H1N1 virus admitted to the three different critical care departments in Turkey. Methods: Retrospective study of critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) at ICU. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbid conditions, and clinical outcomes were collected using a case report form. Results: Critical illness occurred in 61 patients admitted to an ICU with confirmed (n=45) or probable and suspected 2009 influenza A(H1N1). Patients were young (mean, 41.5 years), were female (54%). Fifty-six patients, required mechanical ventilation (14 invasive, 27 noninvasive, 15 both) during the course of ICU. On admission, mean APACHE II score was 18.7±6.3 and median PaO 2 /FIO 2 was 127.9±70.4. 31 patients (50.8%) was die. There were no significant differences in baseline PaO 2 /FIO 2 and ventilation strategies between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients who survived were more likely to have NIMV use at the time of admission to the ICU. Conclusion: Critical illness from 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in ICU predominantly affects young patients with little major comorbidity and had a high case-fatality rate. NIMV could be used in 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection-related hypoxemic respiratory failure.","In 2009, cases of influenza like illness were first reported in Mexico on March 18; the outbreak was subsequently confirmed as H1N1 influenza. A Novel H1N1 swine origin influenza virus has led to a worldwide pandemic (1) . In the affected patients, a novel swine origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) with molecular features of North American and Eur-asian swine, avian, and human influenza viruses were isolated (2) . In the same month, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the global spread of this virus as a public health event of international concern. After documentation of human to human transmission of the virus in at least three countries of two WHO regions, the WHO raised the pandemic level to 6 (3). It has spread very rapidly since the first cases were diagnosed in Mexico with the subsequent spread of the virus throughout Europe during the winter season. The H1N1 2009 influenza pandemic (pH1N1) has resulted in over 15921 deaths worldwide more than 212 countries as of 14 February 2010 (4) . Turkey reported its first laboratory-confirmed case of influenza A (H1N1) on 16 May 2009, becoming the eighteenth country in the WHO European region to do so, and a second case on 17 May 2009 (5) .
The clinical picture in severe cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza is markedly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza, in that many of those affected were previously healthy young people. Current predictions estimate that, during a pandemic wave, 12-30 % of the population will develop clinical influenza (compared with 5-15% for seasonal influenza) with 4% of those patients requiring hospital admissions and one in five requiring critical care (6) .
Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is the first pandemic in which intensive care units (ICU) play a fundamental role. During the pandemic, a significant number of patients became critically ill primarily because of respiratory failure. Most of these patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation (7) .
In this report, we describe futures of intensive care unit admission, demographic characteristics, treatment and outcome for critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed and suspected infection with the H1N1 virus admitted to the three different critical care departments during winter of 2009 in Turkey. Influenza-like illness (ILI) is defined as fever, cough, and headache, accompanied by one or more of the following signs or symptoms: rhinorrhea, coryza, arthralgia, myalgia, prostration, odynophagia, chest pain, abdominal pain, and nasal congestion.
Data were reported by the attending physicians reviewing medical charts, radiologic and laboratory records. The following information was recorded; demographic data, comorbidities, time from illness onset to hospital admission, time to first dose of antiviral delivery, microbiologic findings, and chest radiologic findings at ICU admission. Intubation and mechanical ventilation requirements, adverse events during ICU stay and laboratory findings at ICU admission were also recorded.
We classified patients according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, or suspected) developed by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A confirmed case of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is defined as a person with an ILI with laboratory confirmed novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection by real time RT-PCR (8, 9) .
We defined critically ill patients as those admitted to an adult intensive care unit (ICU); requiring mechanical ventilation or receiving intravenous infusion of inotropic or vasopressors during the hospitalization. Severity of illness was assessed in adults using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II within 24 hours of ICU admission. We recorded co-morbidities and prior defined major co-morbidities as the presence of one or more of the following chronic medical conditions: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), congestive heart failure, malignancy, neuromuscular disorders, cerebral palsy, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery diseases, heart diseases, chemotherapy, malnutrition, immunosuppressive status or renal failure.
Nasopharyngeal-swab specimens were collected at admission, and bronchial-aspirate samples were obtained after tracheal intubation. Specimens were placed in transport medium and kept at a temperature from 2 to 4°C. RT-PCR testing was done in accordance with published guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (10) . Seasonal vaccination history and radiographic findings were recorded to study form. Specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage and blood) for culture sent to microbiology laboratory for detection of bacterial infection in invasive and noninvasive mechanically ventilated patients. The body-mass index (BMI, weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was calculated. Obesity defined as a BMI 30 to 40 in patients. Morbid obesity defined as BMI > 40.
Statistical analysis; Descriptive analysis included frequency (%) and mean ± standard deviation (SD). Mann-Whitney Test used for significance in between groups. We accepted P value <0.05 for significance. Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 .

Un-derlying medical condition was existed in 50 (82 %) patients. Obesity (27.9 %) and COPD (14.7 %) were the most common conditions in patients. There was no significant difference according to underlying medical condition in between nonsurvivor and survivor groups. A total of 3 patients (4.9%) were pregnant, of whom 2 had another underlying medical condition (asthma and heart disease). Of the 4 pregnant patients, 1 was in the first trimester, 1 was in the second trimester, 1 was in the third trimester, and 1 was in the postpartum period.
At the time of ICU admission, all patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (604.8 ± 316.9 U/L), 25 (40.9 %) above 500 U/L, and 7 (11.4 %) above 1000 U/L. Thirty-three patients (54%) had elevated aspartate aminotransferase (144.5 ± 178.07 U/L). Thirteen patients had elevated alanine aminotransferase (121.2 ± 127.5 U/L). Sixteen patients (26%) had increased creatinin kinase levels (mean 418.7 ± 529.1 U/L) (range, 6 to 2573 U/L). C-reactive protein was measured in 48 patients (78.7%) with a mean of 95.1 ± 49.5 mg/dL. Eighteen patients (24.6 %) had elevated creatinine levels (>1.2 mg/dL) at hospital admission.
On admission, 11 of 61 (18 %) patients who were tested had leukopenia, 27 of 61 (42.2 %) had anemia, and 18 of 61 (29.5 %) had thrombocytopenia. Twelve of 61 patients had positive blood and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures.
Of the 61 patients, all of them received oseltamivir. The mean time from the onset of illness to the initiation of antiviral therapy was 7.4±4.17 days (range, 1 to 22 days); 2 of the patients received antiviral therapy within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. Antiviral therapy was started before admission in 4 patients, on admission in 55 patients, within 48 hours after admission in 2 patients. There was significant difference according to the time from the onset of illness to the initiation of antiviral therapy between nonsurvivors and survivors (p<0.05). Initiation time of antiviral treatment was earlier in survivors compared to nonsurvivors. All patients received antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy was started before admission in 32 patients and on admission in 29 patients. Patients received a mean of two different antibiotics (range, one to five); 81% of the patients received more than one antibiotic. Commonly used antibiotics included moxifloxacin (in 19 patients), linezolid (in 14 patients), ampicilline-sulbactam (in 13 patients), clarithromycin (in 13 patients), piperacillin-tazobactam (in 12 patients), imipenem (in 11 patients), third generation cephalosporin (in 9 patients), vancomycin (in 2 patients), teicoplanin (in 4 patients), and tigecycline (in 8 patients).
Of 61 patients for whom data were available regarding the use of corticosteroids, 20 (32.8 %) received intravenous steroids. Of the patients who received corticosteroids, 85 % had an underlying medical condition; the most common conditions were COPD and asthma (70%). Chest radiograph findings were abnormal in 55 patients. Radiographic findings including bilateral infiltrates were existed in 55 patients on admission. Patients with viral primary pneumonia had bilateral patchy alveolar opacities, affecting two or five quadrants in 51 patients.
All patients had a mean oxygen saturation of 65% (range, 45 to 80) in the absence of supplementary oxygen. After supplementary oxygen, all patients had a mean oxygen saturation of 83.7 % (range, 49 to 98).
Mean APACHE II score was 18.7 ± 6.3 (range, 6 to 37). All patients had gas exchange abnormalities on admission. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 127.9±70.4 (range, 34 to 420). ARDS was diagnosed in 48 patients (78.6 %) and ALI in 4 (6.5 %) of the patients. Clinical evidence of bacterial infection on ICU admission was present in 7 patients (11.4 %).
Data on the use of mechanical ventilation in the ICU were available for all patients. Non-invasive mechanic ventilation was performed in 42 patients. Fifteen of these patients were endotracheally intubated after a mean of 3.4 ± 1.7 days. Fourteen patients initially received invasive mechanically ventilation. Thirty (49.2 %) patients survived to hospital discharge. APACHE II score was higher in nonsurvivors (20.9 ± 6.7) than survivors (16.5 ± 5.4) (p<0.01). There were 8 obese patients in nonsurvivor group and in 7 obese patients in survival group (p>0.05). In 3th days, mean level of urea, creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR) and heart rate were higher nonsurvivors than survivors (p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, and p<0.01). PaO2/FiO2 ratio was lower in nonsurvivors than survivors in third ICU day (p<0.05). Renal failure began in third ICU day. Renal failure developed in 10 patients and 6 of them died.
Patients divided into two groups according to type of mechanical ventilatory support. Of all patients, 56 (91%) were mechanically ventilated on the first day of ICU admission; 14 (23 %) patients received invasive and 42 (68.8 %) noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Fifteen patients (24.5 %) who received noninvasive ventilation ultimately required invasive ventilation. Full-face mask was used in all patients for NIMV. APACHE II score, PCO2, white blood cell count and neutrophil account were higher in invasive mechanical ventilation group than NIMV group. Arterial blood pH was lower in invasive mechanical ventilation group than NIMV group. Duration of NIMV and IMV were 5.28 ± 3.4 days (range, 2 to 14) and 6.92 ± 5.8 days (range, 1 to 19) respectively. In survivors, the length of invasive mechanical ventilation ranged from 1 to 19 days (6.2 ± 5.5days). The length of NIMV ranged from 1 to 14 days (4.25 ± 3.8 days). There were no significant differences in tidal volume or ventilation strategies between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients who survived were more likely to have NIMV use at the time of admission to the ICU. Patients who died were more likely to have IMV use at the time of admission to ICU.
Our data of critically ill patients with Influenza A 2009 (H1N1) reveals that relatively younger patients are affected by the disease. Fever and respiratory symptoms were cardinal symptoms of disease in all patients. There was a relatively long period of illness prior to presentation to the hospital, followed by a short period of acute and severe respiratory deterioration. These patients had severe hypoxia requiring high FiO2, PEEP, and ventilator pressures. Within 30 days, 51% of critically ill patients had died. Previously published reports have highlighted cases of severe viral pneumonia affecting patients younger than the expected age of patients affected during a normal influenza season (11) . The low mean age is different from seasonal influenza, in which older patients appear more susceptible to severe diseases (12) . Our findings are consistent with these reports. In our data and in other studies, death was occurred mostly young critically ill patients (1, 13, 14) . But, the risk of death increased with increasing age. Importantly, severity of illness and mortality in our cohort are similar to that demonstrated previously with novel H1N1. The first data from Mexico showed that most of the patients were previously healthy (1). In our study, the most of critically ill patients had comorbidities and there was no difference according to comorbidities between survived and died patients. A history of lung diseases, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, neurological diseases, malignancy, and heart diseases were the most common comorbidities in our study (83.6%). Among critically ill patients, obesity has been shown to be a risk factor for increased morbidity, but not consistently with mortality (15) . In our study, there was no statistically significant difference due to obesity between survivors and nonsurvivors. We did not find a significant difference in BMI between survivors and nonsurvivors. An early 2009 meta-analysis indicated that obesity was not associated with increased ICU mortality (16) . A recent, large cohort study by Gong et al. (17) prior to 2009 novel H1N1 infection, noted an association of obesity with ARDS but not with mortality. The Canadian novel H1N1 experience likewise suggests that BMI did not differ between survivors and non-survivors (18) . Patients with H1N1 infection-related critical illness experienced symptoms for an average of 6 days prior to hospital presentation, but rapidly worsened and required care in the ICU within 1 to 2 days (1). In our study, this duration was higher than other studies (1, 18, 19) . The tendency of females to develop severe 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in this series is striking. A general female susceptibility has been observed in other influenza case series of variable severity including reports of H1N1 infections (18, 19) . In this report, death was higher in males than females. The explanation for increased risk of death among males in this report may be due to existence of more frequent comorbidities in man. In most of infectious diseases and related conditions such as sepsis and septic shock, males represent a larger proportion of cases and have a higher mortality (20, 21) . Importantly, we found in this cohort that APACHE II score may help to identify patients at high risk of death.
Rarely, we used vasopressor support on day 1 following ICU admission (3.2%). Broad-spectrum antibacterial agents were initiated in almost all.
Chest radiographs demonstrating bilateral mixed interstitial or alveolar infiltrates were found in 90% of patients.
In our study, 92% of patients required ventilator support for profound hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring high levels of inspired oxygen and PEEP. However, survival rate was higher in NIMV than invasive ventilation. We used full-face mask in all patients for NIMV. Noninvasive ventilation has been used an alternative therapy for patients with acute respiratory failure with hopes of obviating intubation and mechanical ventilation. The results of NIMV in hypoxemic respiratory failure have been conflicting, and the etiology of hypoxemia appears to be an important determinant of its success. Ferrer et al. (22) compared NIMV to conventional venture oxygen delivery in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and found that NIMV decreased the need for intubation. This benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with pneumonia, but not in those with ARDS, in which the intubation rates were high in both groups. A meta-analysis suggests that NIMV does not decrease the need for intubation, so there is not enough evidence to support its use in ARDS (23) . Of all patients, 56 (91 %) were mechanically ventilated on the first day of ICU admission; 14 (23 %) invasively and 42 (68.8 %) noninvasively. Fifteen patients (24.5%) who received noninvasive ventilation ultimately required invasive ventilation. Dominguez-Cherit et al. (24) reported that invasively ventilation was used in 82.7% of patients. In Kumar's study (18) , invasive ventilation was used in 81% of patients with swine flu associated respiratory failure. In our study, we used noninvasive ventilation in 68.8% of critically patients with 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) on admission ICU. In critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection, high levels of PEEP were often used to achieve adequate oxygenation. In our study, patients with ARDS were often had PEEP refractory hypoxemia. It was also noted that once patients improved and the weaning process was started, oxygenation was sensitive to small decrements in PEEP. We used high PEEP levels up to 20-25 cmH2O in some patients.
Use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation has some significant problems when there is risk of transmitting infectious diseases. Use of noninvasive ventilation was identified as risk factor for transmitting infection due to exposure to aerosols during SARS epidemics (25) . It was advised to avoid from noninvasive ventilation during SARS epidemic. These were expert opinions but in an experimental model, it was claimed that noninvasive ventilatory support may increase occupational risk (26) .
However it was shown multiple times that noninvasive ventilatory support may decrease mortality with avoiding from endotracheal intubation. It is difficult to identify immediately if patients are infected or not during epidemic so noninvasive ventilation can be initial chose of ventilatory support in those patients. There is always a potential harm from a withholding a procedure while there is epidemics. Even if there is risk to use noninvasive ventilation for H1N1 patients since it may save the lives, we decided to use it under strict isolation including negative pressure isolation rooms.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection-related critical illness predominantly affects young patients with little major comorbidity and is associated with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, often requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Among patients admitted to ICU, older age, and a requirement for invasive ventilation were associated with increased risk of death, but because there were greater numbers of younger patients in our cohort, the majority of deaths occurred in younger patients. Alternatively, NIMV could be used in 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection-related hypoxemic respiratory failure.",2009 H1N1 Influenza and Experience in Three Critical Care Units,"Teke, Turgut; Coskun, Ramazan; Sungur, Murat; Guven, Muhammed; Bekci, Taha T; Maden, Emin; Alp, Emine; Doganay, Mehmet; Erayman, Ibrahim; Uzun, Kursat",Int J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074093/,201,2970,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,e100d3d45507da10018bc2b410c93072756fef47,"Newly emerging human viruses such as Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and HIV likely originate within an extant population of viruses in nonhuman hosts and acquire the ability to infect and cause disease in humans. Although several mechanisms preventing viral infection of particular hosts have been described, the mechanisms and constraints on viral host expansion are ill defined. We describe here mycobacteriophage Patience, a newly isolated phage recovered using Mycobacterium smegmatis mc 2 155 as a host. Patience has genomic features distinct from its M. smegmatis host, including a much lower GC content (50.3% versus 67.4%) and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in M. smegmatis. Nonetheless, it propagates well in M. smegmatis, and we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to show expression of over 75% of the predicted proteins, to identify new genes, to refine the genome annotation, and to estimate protein abundance. We propose that Patience evolved primarily among lower-GC hosts and that the disparities between its genomic profile and that of M. smegmatis presented only a minimal barrier to host expansion. Rapid adaptions to its new host include recent acquisition of higher-GC genes, expression of out-of-frame proteins within predicted genes, and codon selection among highly expressed genes toward the translational apparatus of its new host. IMPORTANCE The mycobacteriophage Patience genome has a notably lower GC content (50.3%) than its Mycobacterium smegmatis host (67.4%) and has markedly different codon usage biases. The viral genome has an abundance of codons that are rare in the host and are decoded by wobble tRNA pairing, although the phage grows well and expression of most of the genes is detected by mass spectrometry. Patience thus has the genomic profile of a virus that evolved primarily in one type of host genetic landscape (moderate-GC bacteria) but has found its way into a distinctly different high-GC environment. Although Patience genes are ill matched to the host expression apparatus, this is of little functional consequence and has not evidently imposed a barrier to migration across the microbial landscape. Interestingly, comparison of expression levels and codon usage profiles reveals evidence of codon selection as the genome evolves and adapts to its new environment.","phages (average, 57.3% GC). The genome diversity and percent GC range of the mycobacteriophages support a model for phage genome evolution in which phages migrate much more rapidly across a diverse bacterial landscape than their genomes ameliorate toward that of any one host (4) . Thus, mycobacteriophages at the lower end of the percent GC spectrum are predicted to have infected lower-GC hosts in their recent evolutionary pasts (4) . We note that there are other phage-host systems with mismatched GC contents, such as T4 and the right arm of phage lambda (35.3% and 44.4%, respectively), relative to their Escherichia coli host (50.8%).
There is also substantial variation in tRNA content of the mycobacteriophages. Many have no tRNA genes, and some have only one or a small number, while others-such as the members of clusters C and M-have more than 20 (7, 8) . The rationale for carriage of these is unclear, and there is no obvious correlation between tRNA content and percent GC that might reflect tRNA acquisition to augment gene expression in newly acquired hosts. It has been noted that there is no close correlation between the tRNA specificities encoded by D29 and infrequently used codons (9) or between Bxz1 and phage codon preferences of putative highexpression genes (10) . Analysis of the codon usage of 32 mycobacteriophage genomes showed that there is variation in codon usage preferences (11) . In some phage genomes, the tRNAs may counteract host measures to protect themselves from infection by tRNA destruction (12) .
Here, we describe mycobacteriophage Patience, a newly isolated phage of M. smegmatis mc 2 155 that is a singleton with no close relatives and has a GC content of 50.3%, representing the extreme low end of the percent GC spectrum for mycobacteriophages. Of the predicted 109 Patience protein-coding genes, 61% are ""orphams"" with no close mycobacteriophage relatives in the Phamerator_285 database, and most of the 48 genes with homologues in other mycobacteriophages are most closely related to those in clusters H, R, and D, which also have below-average GC contents. However, Patience has a distinctly different codon usage profile from both its host and other mycobacteriophages and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in the host. Proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry provides evidence for expression of at least 83 Patience proteins, two of which are from cryptic open reading frames (ORFs) embedded within annotated genes. We propose that Patience is a relatively recent visitor to the Mycobacterium neighborhood, having evolved primarily in lower-GC hosts within the Actinomycetales, and is in the process of adapting to growth in its new high-GC genetic environment.
Isolation and genome sequencing of mycobacteriophage Patience. Mycobacteriophage Patience was isolated by direct plating of an environmental sample taken from near the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), Durban, South Africa, using M. smegmatis mc 2 155 as a host (3) . Isolation and purification of Patience were components of a 2-week workshop on mycobacterial genetics offered in July 2009; the genome was sequenced at the University of Pittsburgh and annotated in a second 2-week workshop at UKZN in July 2011. Patience forms normal-size hazy (~1-mm-diameter) plaques on M. smegmatis mc 2 155 at 37°C under standard conditions, although we have been unsuccessful in recovering stable lysogens. It can easily be propagated on solid media to titers greater than 10 10 PFU/ml. The genome is 70,506 bp long, circularly permuted, and presumably terminally redundant. For linear presentation, coordinate 1 is designated the beginning of an open reading frame upstream of the large terminase subunit consistent with the organization of the cluster H phages that contain homologues of the first open reading frame at their left ends (7) . The GenBank submission (JN412589) has been reported previously (3) . Genome annotation identified 109 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and one tRNA gene (Table 1) ; one additional ORF was annotated using mass spectrometry analysis (see below).
Virion morphology and virion PAGE analysis. Mycobacteriophage Patience is morphologically a member of the Siphoviridae with an isometric head and a long flexible tail (Fig. 1A) . The diameter of the heads averages 58 nm, and the tails average 358 nm in length, among the longest of the mycobacteriophages described to date, similar to those of the cluster M phages (348 nm [8] ); other phages with notably long tails are those in cluster H (approximately 290 nm) and cluster R (approximately 288 nm) (13) . SDS-PAGE analysis of Patience particles shows three abundant proteins and at least 12 other lower-abundance proteins between the sizes of 15 and 150 kDa (Fig. 1B) .
Relationship of Patience to other mycobacteriophages. The Patience genome is not closely related to other phage genomes, although dot plot analysis shows weak similarity to cluster H phages (Fig. 2) . The related segments span only 14%, 8%, and 6% of genome lengths with Barnyard, Predator, and Konstantine genomes, respectively (Fig. 2) , and the closest matching segment of Patience and Barnyard is a 1,091-bp region (73% nucleotide identity) corresponding to the capsid subunit genes. Alignment of the genome maps of Patience, Barnyard, Konstantine, and Predator in Phamerator shows their architectural relationships (Fig. 3) , and although the nucleotide sequence similarity is minimal, 37% of Patience genes have homologues in cluster H phages (Fig. 3) . However, more than half of the Patience ORFs are orphams (genes with no close mycobacteriophage relatives [ Fig. 3 ; Table 1 ]).
The overall GC content of the Patience genome is 50.3% and is maintained almost throughout the genome (Fig. 4A ). There are two notable departures suggesting recent acquisitions by horizontal exchange. One is within Patience gene 37, where the 3= end has 81% nucleotide identity to Rosebush gene 32 (subcluster B2) and the elevated percent GC reflects that of the B2 phages (Fig. 4B ). Patience gp37 is related to tail fibers of many other mycobacteriophages that are implicated in host range determination (4). The second example is gene 47 (62% GC [ Fig. 4C ]), although it is an orpham with no close mycobacteriophage relatives and is of unknown function.
Patience genome organization. Genome annotation of Patience indicates that all open reading frames and one tRNA gene are transcribed in the same direction ( Fig. 5 ; Table 1 ). The overall coding capacity is 94.9%, and there are no intergenic spaces greater than 250 bp. The recognizable virion structure and assembly functions lie within the gene 4 to 39 region, and the siphoviral syntenic arrangement of terminase, portal, protease, capsid, headtail connector proteins, major tail subunit, tail assembly chaperones, tape measure, and minor tail protein genes is observed, spanning 32 kbp of the genome (14) . This is atypically long not only because of the long tape measure gene corresponding to the long phage tail but because of a dozen genes of mostly unknown function located between the terminase large subunit (gene 6) and portal (gene 8) genes, between the portal (gene 8) and protease (gene 19) genes, and between the MuF-like gene (gene 20) and the putative scaffolding gene (gene 22) (Fig. 5) ; most of these are orphams (i.e., they do not have a close mycobacteriophage rela-tive), with the exceptions of genes 10 and 18 (Fig. 5 ). Gene 7 encodes a putative Endo VII protein and has weak similarity (Ͻ30% identity) to genes in phages Konstantine and Predator Table S1 in the supplemental material.
(subcluster H1), as well as Dori (singleton). The gene upstream of the terminase large subunit gene encodes a protein with similarities to putative HNH homing nucleases ( Fig. 5 ) but may function as part of the DNA packaging machinery as described for HK97 gp74 (15) . The four leftmost genes (genes 1 to 4) are of unknown function. The lysis cassette is located downstream of the virion structural genes and contains an endolysin gene (gene 41, lysin A) and a putative mycolylarabinogalactan esterase (gene 42, lysin B) (16, 17) . Genes 43 and 44 code for proteins containing two and four predicted transmembrane domains, respectively, that may act as holins or lysis chaperones (18) . The lysis cassette is not closely related to that of the cluster H phages, and lysin A is most closely related to the corresponding genes of cluster M phage PegLeg gp35 and Bongo gp35 (35% identity), with an Org-U domain organization (19) . In contrast, lysin B is most closely related to phages in subcluster B3 (66% identity to Gadget gp48), illustrating the mosaic nature of the lysis cassette (19) . Patience gp43 has no homologues, but gp44 has distant relatives in the cluster D phages (Ͻ30% identity), where the genes are located between lysin A and lysin B.
Of the other 65 Patience ORFs, only seven can be assigned putative functions, most of which are involved in DNA metabolism (helicases, RecA, DNA polymerase III [Pol III] alpha subunit, The three most abundant proteins likely correspond to the major tail subunit (gp31), the capsid subunit (gp23), and gp15, with predicted molecular masses of 30.5 kDa, 35.3 kDa (after processing), and 32 kDa, respectively. The major tail subunit may migrate slower than its predicted mass, as observed in some other phages (37) . Numbers at right are molecular masses in kilodaltons. Table 1 ]). These all have homologues in a variety of mycobacteriophages as well as in phages of Gordonia and Corynebacterium. One (gene 103) encodes a MazG-like protein, a putative nucleoside triphosphate pyro-phosphohydrolase that is common in a variety of phage genomes (20) . Patience has a single tRNA gene, and the tRNA is predicted to be charged with glutamine and has the anticodon 5=-UUG [i.e., tRNA Gln (UUG)]. It is unclear how the Patience genes are tran- (35) and the database Mycobacteriophage_285, containing 285 complete genome sequences, and aligned by the left ends of the tape measure gene. Maps are displayed in three tiers with pairwise nucleotide sequence similarities displayed in spectrum coloring, with violet being the most similar and red the least similar (minimal BLASTN cutoff E value is 10 Ϫ4 ). Genes are shown as colored boxes, with colors reflecting pham assignments for each gene (gene members of a phamily have the same color). Genes shown in white are orphams and have no mycobacteriophage relatives with greater than 32.5% amino acid identity or a BLASTP E value lower than 10 Ϫ50 . Phamily assignments with the number of phamily members in parentheses are above each gene. scribed, and there are no strongly predicted SigA-like promoters, similar to other mycobacteriophages such as Giles (21), even though SigA-like promoters are active in other mycobacteriophages (22) (23) (24) . Table S1 in the supplemental material). Using stringent criteria for peptide identification, we identified 79 of the 109 previously annotated predicted gene products (82 different gene products, including previously unannotated genes) present in at least one of the samples, including 34 of the 35 putative virion structure and assembly proteins (genes 5 to 39), 27 of which are particle associated (Fig. 5) . Although gp9 was not detected, particle-associated peptides corresponding to a previously unannotated 37-codon gene between genes 8 and 9 were identified, which we designate gene 111 (Fig. 5) . Particles contain four additional products, gp1, gp4, gp79, and gp86, although gp86 is abundant in lytic growth and the few particle-associated peptides could be contaminants in the phage preparation (Table S1 ). The capsid subunit (gp23) appears to be proteolytically cleaved between residues 82 and 83 to generate a 35.3-kDa mature protein product; that and the gp31 major tail subunit (30.5 kDa) and gp15 (32 kDa) likely correspond to the three major species observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) . It is noteworthy that-with the exception of 31-residue gp9 -all of the genes corresponding to insertions within the otherwise canonically syntenic virion structure and assembly operon are present in Patience particles, although only 3 spectra of gp21 were identified and could represent contaminants from the lysate (Fig. 5 ; Table S1).
Of the total of 81 Patience proteins identified in infected cells, only one-gp47-was not identified in the late-infected (2.5-hpostinfection) sample. Patience gp47 was identified in the earlyinfected sample and is presumably not expressed late in infection but also is turned over rapidly ( Fig. 5 ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). Many of the virion proteins (genes 1 to 40) are expressed at higher levels (using peptide spectral count as a surrogate for expression) in the late-infected sample, although there is also substantial expression of many of these at the early time. Of the 29 annotated proteins not identified in any of the samples, 11 are predicted to be smaller than 10 kDa and may have escaped detection if they are not expressed at high levels. Twelve are predicted to be membrane or wall associated and are likely excluded from the soluble fractions used for analysis. Peptide abundance in infected cells is expected to generally correlate with expression, although other factors such as protein size and trypsin cleavage efficiencies influence peptide detection.
First, we note that peptides at or near the N terminus confirm the previously annotated translation start site for 54 proteins but also identify seven (gp4, gp17, gp29, gp47, gp53, gp89, and gp101) for which revisions of the annotated start sites are supported. For 16 proteins, the peptide coverage is insufficient to be informative about start site usage. Interestingly, seven proteins, all of them particle associated (gp1, gp20, gp21, gp26, gp31, gp37, and gp79), are acetylated at their N terminus (following methionine loss), although the functional significance-if any-is not known. Six are acetylated at an N-terminal threonine following methionine removal (the seventh is a serine acetylation), although not all proteins with N-terminal threonine residues are acetylated. gp21 is unusual in that the N-terminal-most peptides start at residue 35 of the annotated product following a glycine in the Ϫ1 position, indicating that they were not generated either by tryptic digestion or by translation initiation. Other processes such as posttranslational processing or intron splicing prior to translation may be involved. We also note that gp24 is present in the particles but that the peptide coverage (62 total spectra) is restricted to the N-terminal 50% of the protein, whereas in infected cells, the spectra reflect 100% coverage of the protein (149 total spectra). This could be explained by assembly-associated protein processing. Surprisingly, we identified several peptides corresponding to translation of regions wholly embedded within annotated genes. Two of these were identified only with peptides for which we have lower confidence and will not be considered further. The evidence supporting translation of the other two is, however, quite strong. The first of these is a 372-bp open reading frame transcribed on the same strand, in a different reading frame, within gene 91, the DNA polymerase III catalytic subunit (see Fig. S1A and S2A in the supplemental material). A total of 17 instances of seven different peptides were identified, and the spectra and fragmentation tables strongly support the peptide assignments (see Text S1 in the supplemental material). Moreover, 10 peptides correspond to the extreme N terminus with the methionine present, and there is a strong ribosome binding site upstream (Fig. S2) . Although the protein is seemingly expressed, the functional relevance is unclear. The predicted product has no close database relatives, and the evidence for conservation is ambiguous (Fig. S1A ). Barnyard contains a similar open reading frame within its polymerase, and the products share 30% amino acid identity, whereas the corresponding segments of the polymerases share only 53% identity. This region of the polymerase is more distantly related in Konstantine (40% identity), and the second open reading frame is not conserved (Fig. S1A) .
A similar scenario is seen within Patience gene 20, where two peptides corresponding to a 171-bp open reading frame on the same strand were identified with high confidence (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material). Peptides corresponding to the predicted N terminus were not identified, although a start codon with a strong ribosome binding site is present (Fig. S2B) . The corresponding segment of Patience gp20 is conserved in Barnyard gp18 and Konstantine gp17, but the second open reading frame is not. Presumably, either expression of embedded out-of-frame genes is more common than anticipated or these reflect expression artifacts resulting from the use of noncognate host transcription and translation systems.
Codon selection and adaptation for mycobacterial growth. Because M. smegmatis has a relatively high GC content (67.4%), it is not surprising that these mutational biases (reflected in base composition) result in frequent usage of GC base pairs in thirdcodon positions (Fig. 6A ; see also Fig. S3 and S4 in the supplemental material). Each of the most commonly used of the synonymous codons has GC in the third position, and M. smegmatis mc 2 155 carries tRNAs with anticodons corresponding to all codons with GC in the third position, except for CGC (Fig. S3) . All of the NNU codons are present infrequently and (with the exception of CGU) are decoded by wobble pairing in the codon third position (Fig. S3  and S4) ; M. tuberculosis H37Rv has an almost identical tRNA profile.
Mycobacteriophages such as Twister (65% GC) and KayaCho (70% GC), with nucleotide compositions similar to that of M. smegmatis, have similar synonymous codon distributions (see Fig. S3 and S4 in the supplemental material). In contrast, Patience codon usage patterns are distinctly different, with notably different distributions of codons with respect to their third-position content relative to M. smegmatis ( Fig. 6A ; see also Fig. S3 and S4 ). There are a total of nine switches to a different most commonly used synonymous codon from M. smegmatis, seven of which are NNU codons that are rarely used in the host (five with normalized Fig. S3] ). In total, NNU codons (except CGU, for which there is a cognate host tRNA) represent over 25% of all Patience codons; in contrast, these are only 5% of M. smegmatis codons. This represents an extreme end of a trend between the usage of NNU codons and the overall GC content of the phage, where usage of NNU increases as percent GC decreases (Fig. S5 ).
Although codon usage shows that Patience spent a significant portion of its evolutionary past in hosts with moderate GC contents, it is not clear what its current host range is. If Patience currently exploits more GC-rich hosts, then it would experience not only mutational biases, which would increase its GC content, but selective pressure on its most highly expressed genes to use tRNA pools poised to translate GC-rich genes. This selective pressure would be reflected in a preferred usage of GC-rich codons within highly expressed genes. Patience does experience codon selection, which is shown by the robust positive correlation between codon selection (adapative codon enrichment [ACE z ] [25] ) (see Materials and Methods) and level of gene expression, using total numbers of peptides as identified by mass spectrometry under stringent conditions as a surrogate for expression (Fig. 6B) . Codon selection is measured using ␦ values, or the ratio of codon frequencies in genes experiencing codon selection normalized to their frequencies in genes lacking codon selection. Preferred codons are those with ␦ values greater than 1, indicating more frequent use in genes experiencing codon selection, frequently those expressed to greater levels. Patience favors the use of GCrich codons in genes experiencing codon selection (Table 2) , with 24 of 33 preferred codons bearing GC base pairs in their third positions, whereas 21 of 26 nonpreferred codons end with AT base pairs. Moreover, the patterns of codon preference in Patience (which codons are preferred and which are not) are strongly correlated with that of M. smegmatis (Fig. 6C) , suggesting that this host imposes codon selection congruent with that currently being experienced by Patience. In contrast, Patience codon selection is not congruent with that imposed by hosts with more moderate GC content, such as Escherichia coli (Fig. 6C, inset) , although such surveys can never be conclusive.
Patience represents an intriguing example of a virus that has successfully entered the mycobacterial genetic neighborhood in its relatively recent evolutionary history. Its overall GC content and codon usage profiles are distinctly different from those of its mycobacterial host, suggesting that it primarily evolved in a moderate-GC (~50%) environment. Growth in high-GC bacteria may have required multiple events, including acquisition of part of a tail gene (gene 47) by lateral gene transfer. Nonetheless, the mismatch between viral and host genomic profiles does not appear to have been a substantial impediment to host range expan-sion, although the highly expressed viral genes are under codon selection for more efficient translation by the host apparatus. Interestingly, although Patience conceivably could have responded by acquisition of a tRNA repertoire to facilitate phage gene expression, this has not occurred; the only phage-carried tRNA is tRNA-Gln (UUG), and CAA is not a rare codon in the Patience genome (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material).
Patience is the first phage to our knowledge for which the proteomic profile in infected cells has been examined by mass spectrometry. The approach is highly informative, providing strong evidence that many of the annotated reading frames are expressed-including 29 that are shorter than 120 codons-and providing support for many of the translational start sites, as well as revisions of start sites of several genes. Moreover, a previously unannotated gene was identified (gene 111) containing only 37 codons, and the revision of start codons indicates that two pairs of genes have significant overlaps (Ͼ60 bp). Phage genome annotation is generally more error-prone than that of other genomes because of the abundance of small open reading frames and relatively small gene size (average mycobacteriophage gene length is 640 bp). HPLC-MS/MS adds confidence to genome annotation, especially for phages such as Patience, whose coding potential does not closely match its bacterial host. It is surprising to find that at least two reading frames embedded out of frame within annotated genes are also expressed. These ORFs are generally not conserved and may not express functional products, but an intriguing possibility is that this expression is a consequence of movement into higher-GC hosts, presenting a small reservoir of new products available for selection and further adaption at little evolutionary cost. We note that ribosomal profiling of phage suggests that previously unannotated genes are expressed from its genome (26) .
The recent evolutionary history of Patience supports a model in which the diversity of viruses of a given host is a function of rapid movement from one host to another coupled with a landscape of diverse but closely related hosts in which the viruses evolve (4) . The large collection of mycobacteriophages that infect the common host M. smegmatis mc 2 155 encompasses considerable diversity of sequence and GC content, and it seems likely that other groups of phages have entered the high-GC environment relatively recently, with Patience representing an extreme example. We note that there are bacterial strains within the order Actinomycetales, such as those of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Corynebacterium ulcerans, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which have moderate GC contents (52.5%, 53.4%, and 53.5%, respectively) and may be relatives of hosts that supported Patience growth in its earlier evolutionary history. Their codon usage profiles (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material) more closely reflect those of the lower-GC mycobacteriophages such as Patience. Patience may share gene content with phages of such hosts, but to date, few have been characterized, other than some prophages such as phage Beta of C. diphtheriae (27, 28) . Deeper exploration into the phages of these hosts and other hosts is thus likely to be highly informative and provide insights into viral origins and viral evolution (29) .
DNA sequencing. Patience was isolated using standard methods as described previously (7, 30) , and the genome was sequenced using 454 technology at the University of Pittsburgh's Genomics and Proteomics Core Laboratories; a total of~45,000 reads were assembled to yield an average (34) , and Phamerator (35) . The Phamerator database used for genomic comparisons was Mycobacteriophage_285. Phams were built using BLASTP and/or ClustalW, with similarity cutoff E values of 10 Ϫ50 and 32.5% similarity or better as described elsewhere (35) . Codon usage and codon selection. Codon usage resulting from mutational biases was estimated using the collection of all genes from a genome. The fraction (f) of each codon for a given amino acid was calculated as the ratio of the codon count to the amino acid count. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) normalizes codon frequencies so that the sum of RSCU for codons of each amino acid is equal to the number of synonymous codons for that amino acid.
To measure codon selection, a second codon usage table (f o ) was tabulated, limited to genes experiencing strong codon selection. For bacterial genomes, this table was constructed from homologues of Sharp's set of 40 genes whose products participate in translation (36) . For Patience, this table was constructed in three steps. First, a codon usage table was generated from 20% of the genome using the genes with the most extreme value of codon usage bias as determined by 2 (where expected codon usage is calculated from the nucleotide composition). Next, adaptive codon enrichment (ACE u ) values (25) are calculated for all genes as described previously (25) , using this table to represent codon frequencies under codon selection (f o ) and the frequencies of codons among all genes in the Patience genome to represent codon frequencies expected from mutational processes alone (f N (34) , and Phamerator (35) .
Electron microscopy. CsCl gradient-purified Patience particles were applied to glow-discharged Formvar-and carbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh) (Ted Pella). They were stained with 1% uranyl acetate and imaged with a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu Orca HR side-model digital camera and AMT540 software. SDS-PAGE. Patience particles were concentrated and purified via CsCl gradient and ultracentrifugation. The visible phage band was dialyzed against two changes of phage buffer; 500 l of the dialyzed CsCl band was pelleted by a 30-min spin at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 75 l of 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and then 2 l of 0.5 M EDTA and 1 l of 1 M MgSO 4 were added. The phage was disrupted by being heated to 75°C for 2 min and then sonicated on ice six times for 30 s to disrupt the DNA. The sample was then mixed with 25 l of 4ϫ SDS sample buffer and heated in a boiling bath for 3 min at 95°C. The sample was electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue in methanol.
HPLC-MS/MS. Five milliliters of exponentially growing M. smegmatis mc 2 155 (optical density at 600 nm [OD 600 ] of 0.4) in 7H9-ADC medium (30) was concentrated to a 500-l volume via low-speed centrifugation and infected with Patience at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. Phage particles were allowed to adsorb for 15 min, and then 4.5 ml of fresh 7H9 medium was added to the culture and incubated with shaking for 3 h at 37°C; the OD 600 was monitored throughout to follow cell growth and lysis. At 30 min and 150 min postadsorption, a 1-ml aliquot was removed from the culture, the cells were pelleted via centrifugation (1 min, 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge), and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was frozen at Ϫ80°C and then shipped overnight on wet ice to the University of California, Davis Proteomics Core (UCDPC) (http://proteomics.ucdavis.edu). There, the cells were lysed via a MagNA Lyser, the insoluble fraction was removed, and the soluble proteins were precipitated, digested with trypsin, and cleaned up using a MacroSpin column. The peptides were then separated using an Easy-LC II high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system and loaded into a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a Proxeon nanospray source (Thermo) for tandem MS analysis. Detected spectra and fragmentation profiles were matched against a database comprised of a six-frame translation of the Patience genome, the annotated proteins of M. smegmatis mc 2 155, and UniProt using X! Tandem. Peptide matches were analyzed using Scaf-fold4. The ""Relaxed"" settings (as reported in Table S1 in the supplemental material) used a peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% and a protein FDR of 5%; the ""Stringent"" settings used a peptide FDR of 0.1% and a protein FDR of 0.6%. Estimation of relative protein abundance was determined by normalizing the total number of spectra detected to the gene size.

Using data relevant to the 2014e2015 Ebola transmission dynamics in the three West African countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), uncertainty analysis of the model show that, although the current level and effectiveness of quarantine can lead to significant reduction in disease burden, they fail to bring the associated quarantine reproduction number (R Q 0 ) to a value less than unity (which is needed to make effective disease control or elimination feasible). This reduction of R Q 0 is, however, very possible with a modest increase in quarantine rate and effectiveness. It is further shown, via sensitivity analysis, that the parameters related to the effectiveness of quarantine (namely the parameter associated with the reduction in infectiousness of infected quarantined individuals and the contact rate during quarantine) are the main drivers of the disease transmission dynamics.

Ebola virus disease (EVD), which first appeared in 1976 in Zaire (Bowen et al., 1977; Johnson, Webb, Lange, & Murphy, 1977) , is one of the most virulent viral diseases of humans, with a case fatality ratio estimated between 25 and 90% (World Health Organization, 2018a) . EVD is transmitted between humans through contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected or dead humans or animals, and its incubation period range between 2 and 21 days. The symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, body rash, tremors and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. The largest Ebola outbreak so far started in Guinea in December 2013 (World Health Organization, 2015) . During this epidemic, almost 29,000 people contracted the disease which resulted in more than 11,000 deaths, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. A new outbreak started recently (on 4 April 2018) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and (as of October 20, 2018) there have already been 237 Ebola cases and 153 deaths (World Health Organization, 2018b) .
Quarantine, defined loosely as the temporary removal (from their immediate abode or the general population) of people suspected of being exposed to a communicable disease, has historically been used as an effective basic public health control measure to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. There are numerous issues pertaining to the logistic of the actual implementation of quarantine as a control strategy, such as who should be quarantined and for how long suspected people should be in quarantine (these have major socio-economic and public health implications). For instance, in the case of the 2014 outbreaks of the EVD, some US states imposed a three-week quarantine period for all health care workers who returned to the United States from the Ebola-affected regions (where they may have cared for patients with Ebola) (Campbell, Adan, & Morgado, 2017; Drazen et al., 2014) . It was, however, shown by Haas (Haas, 2014) that the three-week period may not be optimal (in particular, it was shown that exposed individuals with 0.2%e12% risk of developing disease may be released from quarantine prior to the end of the incubation period). On August 1, 2014, the three Western African countries affected by the epidemic (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) announced the enforcement of a mass quarantine in vast forest areas around their common borders that are considered the epicentre of the outbreak (a few days later, Liberian authorities imposed a 10-day quarantine over West Point; Sierra Leone announced, on September 6, a nationwide mass quarantine between September 19 and 21) (Eba, 2014) .
Numerous mathematical modeling studies have been conducted to study the transmission dynamics and control of EVD. In fact, the earliest mathematical models for EVD appeared long before the 2014e15 epidemic. Chowell et al. (Chowell, Hengartner, Castillo-Chavez, Fenimore, & Hyman, 2004) proposed a stochastic SEIR model to fit data from the 1995 and 2000 outbreaks in Congo and Uganda. This model was further developed by Legrand et al. (Legrand, Grais, Boelle, Valleron, & Flahault, 2007) by including two new compartments for hospitalized people and for people who died from Ebola but have not yet been buried. Several new models appeared soon after the start of the 2014 outbreak (Nishiura & Chowell, 2014; Towers, Patterson-Lomba, & Castillo-Chavez, 2014) . The model by Legrand et al. was used to study the 2014e15 Ebola outbreaks by Rivers et al. (Rivers, Lofgren, Marathe, Eubank, & Lewis, 2014 ). Webb and Browne incorporated age of infection in their model (Webb & Browne, 2016) . Tsanou et al. considered the role of host-reservoir transmission (with bats as reservoir) of EVD and spillover potential to humans (Tsanou, Bowong, Lubuma, & Mbang, 2017) . Furthermore, Tsanou et al. (Tsanou, Lubuma, Ouemba Tass e, & Tenkam, 2018) studied the impact of environmental contamination on the transmission dynamics of EVD. Several other studies incorporated the effect of anti-EVD control measures, such as increasing hospitalization, timely burial of people who died from EVD and distribution and use of protective kits in households (Althaus, 2014; Barbarossa et al., 2015; Lewnard et al., 2014) . For instance, Agusto et al. (Agusto, Teboh-Ewungkem, & Gumel, 2015) studied the effect of traditional beliefs and customs on the transmission dynamics of the disease.
A number of mathematical models, typically of the form of deterministic systems of nonlinear differential equations, have been designed and used to gain insight into the population-level impact of quarantine (of people suspected of being exposed to a disease) and isolation (of people with clinical symptoms of a communicable disease) on the spread and control of infectious diseases (see, for instance, the models in (Day, Park, Madras, Gumel, & Wu, 2006; Gumel et al., 2004; Hethcote, Zhien, & Shengbing, 2002; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi, Kribs Zaleta, Martcheva, & Castillo-Ch avez, 2010; Nuño, Feng, Martcheva, & Castillo-Chavez, 2005; Safi & Gumel, 2010; Safi & Gumel, 2013; Safi & Gumel, 2015; Yan & Zou, 2008) ). Hethcote (Hethcote et al., 2002) presented SIQS (susceptible-infected-quarantined-susceptible) and SIQR (susceptible-infected-quarantinedrecovered) models for the dynamics of an infectious disease that is controllable using quarantine and isolation, showing that the use of quarantine-adjusted incidence induces the phenomenon of Hopf bifurcation in the transmission dynamics of the disease. Nuño et al. (2005) also showed oscillatory dynamics in an SIQR model for the dynamics of two strains of influenza in a population. Similarly, a probabilistic model was designed and used by Day et al. (Day et al., 2006) to determine the conditions under which quarantine is expected to be useful. The Day et al. study showed that the number of infections averted through quarantine is expected to be low if isolation is effective, but the number increases abruptly as the effectiveness of isolation diminishes. It is worth mentioning, however, that in majority of the quarantine, or quarantine and isolation, models in the literature (including the models in all of the aforementioned studies, with exception of those in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010; Safi & Gumel, 2013) ), the term ""quarantine"" was generally incorrectly used to refer to the removal of individuals who already have been infected with the disease (either in the exposed/latent (Day et al., 2006; Gumel et al., 2004; Safi & Gumel, 2010; Safi & Gumel, 2015) , or even in the symptomatic (Hethcote et al., 2002; Nuño et al., 2005) class). In other words, the term ""quarantine"" was used instead of the more epidemiologically-appropriate term, ""isolation"". As stated earlier, quarantine is the temporary removal of susceptible individuals who are feared to have been exposed to a communicable disease. These (currently-susceptible-but-feared-exposed) individuals are temporarily removed from the actively-mixing population until, at the very least, after the incubation period of the disease, after which they are tested to determine whether or not they have the disease. If they have acquired the infection, they are then placed in isolation. If they do not show clinical symptoms of the disease at the end of the quarantine period, they return to the susceptible (and actively-mixing) population. People can be quarantined at home (i.e., self-quarantine) or in public health facility (such as hospital, health centers or makeshift facility, such as the military tents used during the 2014 ebola outbreaks (Drazen et al., 2014) ). Quarantine is correctly modeled in a few studies, including in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010; Safi & Gumel, 2013) . In particular, Lipsitch et al. (Lipsitch et al., 2003) modeled quarantine of susceptible individuals based on the number of individuals with clinical symptoms of the disease in the community. In addition to allowing for the quarantine of susceptible individuals, the model developed by Safi and Gumel (Safi & Gumel, 2013) also accounted for the adjustment of the disease incidence function to account for the actively-mixing population (in line with Hethcote (Hethcote et al., 2002) ). These features were also incorporated in the model developed by Mubayi et al. (Mubayi et al., 2010) . It is worth stating, however, that the quarantine models in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010) do not allow breakthrough infection during quarantine. In other words, the models in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010) assume perfect quarantine (this assumption is relaxed in the current study).
The purpose of the current study is to design a new model for realistically assessing the population-level impact of quarantine (assumed to be imperfect, so that individuals in quarantine can acquire infection during quarantine) on the spread and control of the 2014e2015 EVD outbreaks in the three affected Western African countries. The paper is organized as follows. The model is formulated and fitted with observed data in Section 2 (the basic properties of the model, as well as the local asymptotic stability result for the associated disease-free equilibrium, are also given). A special case of the model, in the absence of quarantine, is rigorously analysed in Section 3. Numerical simulations of the full model are reported in Section 5.
The model is formulated as follows. The total population at time t, denoted by NðtÞ, is split into the population of those in quarantine (denoted by N Q ðtÞ) and those not in quarantine (denoted by N U ðtÞÞ, so that NðtÞ ¼ N Q ðtÞ þ N U ðtÞ. The total population of individuals in quarantine at time t is divided into those that are susceptible ðS Q ðtÞÞ, exposed (E Q ðtÞ; that is, infected but not yet infectious) and symptomatic ðI Q ðtÞÞ. Hence,
Similarly, the total population of individuals not in quarantine at time t is sub-divided into the sub-populations of susceptible (S U ðtÞ), exposed (E U ðtÞ), symptomatic (I U ðtÞ), treated ðI T ðtÞÞ, recovered ðRðtÞÞ, dead ðDðtÞÞ, so that N U ðtÞ ¼ S U ðtÞ þ E U ðtÞ þ I U ðtÞ þ I T ðtÞ þ RðtÞ þ DðtÞ:
The force of infection associated with the model to be developed (denoted by lðtÞ) is given by
where h T , h Q and h D are modification parameters accounting for the variability of the infectiousness of infected individuals in the I T , I Q and D classes, in comparison to those in the I U class, respectively. Following Lipsitch et al. (Lipsitch et al., 2003) , quarantine is modeled as follows: a fraction, q, of susceptible individuals who are feared exposed to Ebola (i.e., by having contact with a confirmed Ebola case) are placed in quarantine. Owing to its assumed imperfect nature, individuals in quarantine can be infected (and moved to the compartment E Q ) with probability b (quarantined individuals remain susceptible and stay in the quarantined susceptible S Q class during quarantine with probability 1 À b). Quarantined individuals who do not develop the disease at the end of the quarantine period are moved to the S U class at a rate r Q . The model is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations (where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to time t; a schematic diagram of the model is depicted in Fig. 1 and the parameters of the model are described in Table 1 ):
(2) with the auxiliary equation B 0 ðtÞ ¼ fDðtÞ;
and lðtÞ as given by (1). In (2), P is the recruitment rate (by birth or immigration), k is the average daily per capita contact rate in the community, b is the transmission probability per contact (here, we follow Lipsitch et al. (Lipsitch et al., 2003) in separating the parameters k and b instead of applying the usual composite transmission parameter b. That is, we assume that each infectious individual makes k contacts per day, and a proportion, b, of these contacts lead to infection). The parameters q and d represent, respectively, the quarantine rate of susceptible individuals and the natural mortality rate (the latter rate is assumed to be the same in all epidemiological compartments). Individuals in quarantine acquire EVD infection at a rate bk Q Q . The parameter p accounts for the rate of progression from any of the exposed classes (E U or E Q ) to the corresponding symptomatic class (I U or I Q ). That is, 1=p is the mean incubation period of the disease. Infectious individuals in the I U and I Q classes are hospitalized at a rate w. The parameters v and m are, respectively, the recovery rate and per capita disease-induced (Gomes et al., 2014; Legrand et al., 2007; Rivers et al., 2014) 1=f Mean time from death due to Ebola to burial 0.762 weeks World Health Organization (2015) death rate. Ebola-deceased individuals are buried at a rate f (i.e., 1=f is the mean time from death to burial for Ebola-deceased individuals) (Agusto et al., 2015; Barbarossa et al., 2015; Legrand et al., 2007) . It is worth emphasizing that, in contrast to Lipsitch et al. (Lipsitch et al., 2003) , it is assumed in this study that hospitalized individuals can transmit infection (hence, the mean duration of infectiousness is 1=ðw þ m þ vÞ).
The model (2) is an extension of many existing models for quarantine and isolation (such as those in (Gumel et al., 2004; Hethcote et al., 2002; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010; Nuño et al., 2005; Safi & Gumel, 2010; Safi & Gumel, 2013; Safi & Gumel, 2015; Yan & Zou, 2008) ) by, inter alia:
1. Incorporating the quarantine of susceptible individuals (this was not included in the models in (Gumel et al., 2004; Hethcote et al., 2002; Nuño et al., 2005; Safi & Gumel, 2010; Safi & Gumel, 2015; Yan & Zou, 2008) ). 2. Using nonlinear quarantine rate of susceptible individuals (linear rates were used in (Mubayi et al., 2010; Safi & Gumel, 2013) ). 3. Allowing for breakthrough infection during quarantine (perfect quarantine and isolation were assumed in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010) . That is, the models in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010) assume that susceptible individuals in quarantine do not acquire infection during the quarantine period). 4. Allowing for disease transmission by infected individuals in quarantine and/or isolation (this was not accounted for in the models in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010) ). 5. Allowing for the heterogeneity between infected individuals in quarantine and isolation and those not in quarantine and isolation (i.e., we stratify the infected population into E Q and I Q for those in quarantine and isolation, and E U and I U for those not in quarantine and isolation). This allows for the assessment of the effectiveness of an intervention strategy aimed at encouraging infected people in quarantine and isolation to positively modify their behavior so that they do not continue to generate more infections (this stratification is not considered in the model in (Mubayi et al., 2010) . That is, all infected individuals are lumped into the same compartment in (Mubayi et al., 2010) , regardless of their quarantine or isolation status).
Further, the model (2) extends many of the EVD models in the literature (such as those in (Agusto et al., 2015; Chowell et al., 2004; Tsanou et al., 2017) ) by, inter alia, allowing for the quarantine of susceptible individuals and disease acquisition and transmission during quarantine and isolation (or hospitalization).
The basic qualitative properties of the model (2), with respect to the nonnegativity and boundedness of solutions, will now be explored.
Lemma 2.1. Suppose that the initial values S U ð0Þ, S Q ð0Þ, E U ð0Þ, E Q ð0Þ, I U ð0Þ, I T ð0Þ, I Q ð0Þ, Rð0Þ, Dð0Þ, Bð0Þ of the model (2) are all nonnegative. Then, the solution of (2) starting with these initial values will remain nonnegative for all time t > 0. Furthermore, all solutions of the model (2) are bounded.
Proof. The proof for the nonnegativity component of the theorem is by contradiction (see Theorem A4 of (Thieme, 2003) ). Suppose that the statement of the lemma (with respect to nonnegativity) does not hold. That is, there is at least one of the nine state variables of the model (2), and a t ¼ t Ã ! 0, such that the value of this state variable goes through 0 at t ¼ t Ã , and all state variables of the model take nonnegative values for 0 t t Ã . For example, consider the state variable is S U ðtÞ. It can be seen that the derivative of S U ðtÞ is positive if S U ðtÞ ¼ 0. Hence, S U ðtÞ cannot decrease further once it has reached 0. The case of each of the other state variable of the model can be shown in a similar way.
To show that all solutions of the model (2) The result below follows from the above analyses.
Lemma 2.2. The region G is positively-invariant for the model (2) for every nonnegative initial condition in ℝ 9 þ .
It should, first of all, be stated that good estimates for pretty much all the non-quarantine related parameters of the model (2) are available in the literature, as tabulated in Table 1 . Further, good estimates for one of the four quarantine-related parameters (h Q ) are available. Thus, our task is to find good estimates for the remaining three quarantine-related parameters of the model (k Q Q , r Q and q). In order to do so, and to subsequently validate the model, we fitted the model using the available cumulative data for the 2014e15 Ebola outbreaks in three affected West African countries. We apply Latin Hypercube Sampling (a Monte-Carlo sampling method used in statistics to measure simultaneous variation of several model parameters (McKay, Beckman, & Conover, 1979) ) to generate a representative sample set from the parameter ranges for the three quarantine-related parameters (k Q Q , r Q and q), while the baseline values for the rest of the parameters, given in Table 1 , are used as well. For all elements of this representative sample set, we numerically calculate the solutions of the model (2) with the given parameter values and apply the least squares method to find the parameters which give the best fit. We consider the data of the first 40 weeks of the outbreak (World Health Organization, 2018d) (as tabulated in Table 2 ), as after this time, several intervention measures were implemented (hence, the estimates for many of the control-related parameters of the model, including the transmission, hospitalization and burial rates, changed significantly). The estimated values of the two quarantine-related parameters of the model obtained from the fitting exercise are tabulated in Table 1 . The simulation results obtained for the cumulative number of cases, by fitting the model with the data of the first 40-week period, are depicted in Fig. 2 . The figure shows a reasonably good fit (thereby adding realism to the predictive capacity of the model (2)). The goodness of the fit is theoretically measured by computing the associated average relative error of the fit using the formula Table 2 ), respectively. The reasonably small value of the relative error (0.8134) confirms the goodness of the fit obtained.

Analysis of special case of the model: quarantine-free with mass action incidence
We consider, first of all, a special case of the model (2) in the absence of quarantine (i.e., the model (2) with q ¼ 0) and constant total population (i.e., the model (2) with mass action incidence, rather than standard incidence). The two assumptions are made for mathematical tractability, in addition to allowing for the determination of whether or not adding quarantine to the resulting model (without quarantine) will alter its dynamical features. The second assumption of constant total population is justified since Ebola-induced mortality is generally very negligible, in comparison to the total population in the affected areas (World Health Organization, 2018d). The quarantine-free model with constant total population is given by: S 0 U ðtÞ ¼ P À kbS U ðtÞI U ðtÞ À kbh T S U ðtÞI T ðtÞ À kbh D S U ðtÞDðtÞ À dS U ðtÞ; E 0 U ðtÞ ¼ kbS U ðtÞI U ðtÞ þ kbh T S U ðtÞI T ðtÞ þ kbh D S U ðtÞDðtÞ À pE U ðtÞ À dE U ðtÞ; I 0 U ðtÞ ¼ pE U ðtÞ À ðv þ m þ wÞI U ðtÞ À dI U ðtÞ; I 0 T ðtÞ ¼ wI U ðtÞ À ðv þ mÞI T ðtÞ À dI T ðtÞ; R 0 ðtÞ ¼ v½I U ðtÞ þ I T ðtÞ À dRðtÞ; D 0 ðtÞ ¼ m½I U ðtÞ þ I T ðtÞ À fDðtÞ:

The reduced model (3) 
with R 0 (the basic reproduction number of the model (3)) given by
The non-trivial equilibrium E 1 exists whenever R 0 > 1 (it should be noted that the S U component of this equilibrium is positive for R 0 > 1, since 1 À 1 R 0 < 1 and P > 1). Table 1 ).
The global asymptotic stability property of the DFE (E 0 ) of the model (3) will be explored using the approach in [38, Theorem2.1]. It is worth recalling the following result.
Theorem A. ([ (Shuai & van den Driessche, 2013) , Theorem2.1]).
Consider the system x 0 ¼ F ðx; yÞ À V ðx; yÞ; y 0 ¼ gðx; yÞ (4) with g ¼ ðg 1 ; …; g m Þ T . The vectors x ¼ ðx 1 ; …; x n Þ2ℝ n and y ¼ ðy 1 ; …; y m Þ T 2ℝ m represent the populations in the disease compartments and the disease-free compartments, respectively. The functions F and V are defined as F ¼ ðF 1 ; …; F n Þ T and V ¼ ðV 1 ; …; V n Þ T such that F i denotes the rate of new infections in the ith disease compartment and V i ; i ¼ 1; …; n denote transition terms. Assume that the disease-free system y 0 ¼ gð0; yÞ has a unique equilibrium y 0 > 0 which is locally asymptotically stable within the disease-free space. Define the two n Â n matrices F and V as
and let, fðx; yÞ :¼ ðF À VÞx À F ðx; yÞ þ V ðx; yÞ:
Furthermore, let u T ! 0 be the left eigenvector of the matrix V À1 F corresponding to the eigenvalue R 0 . If fðx; yÞ 0 in G3ℝ nþm þ , F ! 0, V À1 ! 0 and R 0 1, then Q ¼ u T V À1 x is a Lyapunov function for (4) on G.
Theorem 3.1. The disease-free equilibrium E 0 of the model (3) is globally-asymptotically stable inG :¼ fðS U ðtÞ; E U ðtÞ; I U ðtÞ; I T ðtÞ; RðtÞ; DðtÞÞ2ℝ 6 þ g whenever R 0 1.
Proof. Using the notation in Theorem A above, the next generation matrices, V and F, associated with the model (3) are given, respectively, by
and the function f is given by
Hence, each condition of Theorem A is satisfied. Further, it follows from the above derivations that u T V À1 x is a Lyapunov function for (3), where u is the left eigenvector of the matrix V À1 F corresponding to the eigenvalue R 0 . The statement of the theorem follows from LaSalle's Invariance Principle (LaSalle & Lefschetz, 1961) . ∎
The global asymptotic stability property of the endemic equilibrium E 1 of the model (3) will be explored using results from (Shuai & van den Driessche, 2013) . It is worth recalling the following result. Let U be an open set in ℝ n . Consider a differential equation system z 0 k ¼ f k ðz 1 ; z 2 ; …; z m Þ; k ¼ 1; 2; …; m;
with z ¼ ðz 1 ; z 2 ; …; z m Þ2U. Suppose the following assumptions are satisfied.
1. There exist functions D i : U/ℝ, G ij : U/ℝ and constants a ij ! 0 such that for every 1 i n, D 0 i ¼ D 0 i j ð5Þ P n j¼1 a ij G ij ðzÞ for z2U. 2. For A ¼ ½a ij , each directed cycle C of the weighted digraph G defined by the weight matrix A has P ðs;rÞ2E ðC Þ G rs ðzÞ 0 for z2U, where E ðC Þ denotes the arc set of the directed cycle C .
Then, there exist constants c i ! 0 such that the function D ðzÞ ¼ P n i¼1 c i D i ðzÞ is a Lyapunov function for (5). We claim the following result.
Theorem 3.2. The endemic equilibrium E 1 of the model (3) is globally-asymptotically stable iñ Gy n ðS U ðtÞ; E U ðtÞ; I U ðtÞ; I T ðtÞ; RðtÞ; DðtÞÞ2ℝ 6 þ :
Proof. Define h : ℝ/ℝ as hðxÞ ¼ x À 1 À lnx and let
At the endemic equilibrium, the following equalities hold:
Noting that hðxÞ ! 0 for all x > 0 and hðxÞ ¼ 0 if and only if x ¼ 1, and applying the above equalities, gives: :¼ a 43 G 43 þ a 42 G 42 :
Hence, Assumption (1) of Theorem B holds. Define the weighted digraph ðG ; AÞ associated with the weight matrix A ¼ ½a ij , with a ij defined as the constants in the above inequalities (and all other a ij 's not mentioned above are set to zero; see also Fig. 3) .
For all cycles of ðG ;AÞ, the Assumption (2) of Theorem B can easily be verified. For instance, the case of the cycle ①/②/ ③/④ is verified as follows. For this cycle, The other cases can be handled in a similar way. Hence, the statement of the theorem follows from Theorem B. It is worth stating that, using the baseline values of the parameters in Table 1 , the value of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is R 0 ¼ 1:403 > 1 (hence, it follows from Theorem 3.2 that the disease will persist in the population). It is further worth noting that this value of R 0 lies in the range given in numerous modeling studies for the 2014 EVD outbreaks (such as those in (Agusto et al., 2015; Barbarossa et al., 2015; Gomes et al., 2014; Nishiura & Chowell, 2014; Towers et al., 2014) ).
In this section, the local asymptotic stability of the DFE of the full model (2) (with both quarantine and standard incidence) will be analysed. The DFE of the full model is given by:
0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0 ;
and it can be shown (using the next generation operator method (Diekmann, Heesterbeek, & Roberts, 2010; van den Driessche & Watmough, 2002) ) that the associated quarantine reproduction number, denoted by R Q 0 , is given by:
The result below follows from Theorem 2 of (van den Driessche & Watmough, 2002).
Theorem 4.1. The DFE of the full model (2), E 01 , is locally-asymptotically stable if R Q 0 < 1, and is unstable if R Q 0 > 1. As in Gumel, 2013, 2015) , the model (2) can be shown (using standard tools, such as the centre manifold theory (Castillo-Chavez & Song, 2004) ) to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation at R Q 0 ¼ 1, a dynamic phenomenon associated with the co-existence of stable disease-free equilibrium and a stable endemic equilibrium when the associated reproduction threshold, R Q 0 , is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this phenomenon, which arises due to the imperfect nature of quarantine to prevent disease transmission during quarantine (i.e., leaky quarantine), is that having R Q 0 < 1, while necessary, is no longer sufficient for the effective control of the disease. In other words, quarantine-induced backward bifurcation makes the effort for the effective control of Ebola more difficult. Hence, this study shows that adding imperfect quarantine to the quarantine-free Ebola transmission model (3) induces a new dynamical phenomenon (backward bifurcation) that was not present in the quarantine-free model.
The model (2) contains numerous parameters, and uncertainties are expected to arise in the estimates of the parameter values used in the model simulations. Uncertainty analysis, using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) (Blower & Dowlatabadi, 1994) , is used to account for such uncertainty. The baseline values and ranges of the parameters in Table 1 are used for this analysis, and it is assumed each parameter of the model obeys a uniform distribution. Using the quarantine reproduction number (R Q 0 ) as the response function, the results for the uncertainty analysis obtained show that R Q 0 lies in the range ð0:268; 2:585Þ, with a mean 1:013 > 1 (Fig. 4(a) ). This simulation suggests that, although the community-wide implementation of quarantine significantly reduces the basic reproduction number (R 0 ¼ 1:403 in this case), this level (and effectiveness) of quarantine is unable to lead to the effective control of the disease (since R Q 0 > 1, albeit only slightly). However, if the parameter h Q , for the reduction of infectiousness of quarantined-infected individuals, is further reduced from its baseline value (e.g., if it is reduced from 0.502 to 0), the mean value of R Q 0 reduces to 0:997 < 1 (so that effective disease control is feasible in this case) (see Fig. 4(b) ). Similarly, increasing the quarantine rate (q) from the current baseline value of q ¼ 0:125 to q ¼ 0:4, for instance, leads to a reduction of mean R Q 0 from R Q 0 ¼ 1:009 to R Q 0 ¼ 0:997 (see Fig. 4 (c)). In other words, these simulations show that the singular implementation of quarantine strategy in the community can lead to the effective control (or elimination) of the disease if the coverage (q) and effectiveness of quarantine to prevent transmission during quarantine (i.e., reduce h Q ) is high enough.
Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is carried out, using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCCs (Blower & Dowlatabadi, 1994) ), to determine the parameters of the model (2) that have the highest impact on the disease dynamics. For these simulations, the cumulative number of new cases is chosen as the response function. The sensitivity analysis based on the PRCC ranks the effect of the parameters on the response function (or outcome), while varying the parameters in their given ranges (parameters with higher positive (negative) PRCC values are positively (negatively) correlated with the response function). Table 3 depicts the resulting PRCC values obtained for the parameters of the model, from which it follows that the average contact rate in the community",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðkÞ and the probability of transmission per contact (b) are the most dominant parameters that affect the response function (the cumulative number of cases). The mean length of time for the burial of Eboladeceased individuals (1=f ) is also shown to be influential, as expected (having the third highest PRCC value in magnitude). Further, of the quarantine-related parameters, those related to the quarantine of susceptible individuals (q) and the reduction of the infectiousness of quarantined-infected individuals (h Q Q ) are also influential (albeit with significantly decreased PRCC values in magnitude in comparison to the PRCC values of k and b). Thus, this study suggests that a quarantine program that significantly decreases the value of h Q Q (which can be achieved by effectively treating infected quarantined individuals and/or limiting their contacts with susceptible individuals during quarantine) or increase q (by increasing the contact tracing and quarantining of people feared exposed to EVD infection) can lead to a significant reduction in disease burden. Table 1 . ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Further numerical simulations are carried out to assess the population-level impact of the quarantine-related parameters of the model (2). These simulations show, in particular, that while the quarantine of susceptible individuals (q) and the average duration in quarantine (1=r Q ) have marginal impact on the cumulative number of new Ebola cases (Figs. 5 and 6, respectively), the modification parameter for transmission during quarantine (h Q ) and the contact rate during quarantine (k Q Q ) have significant impact on the disease burden ( Figs. 7 and 8, respectively) . In other words, these simulations show that the parameters related to the efficacy of quarantine (h Q and k Q Q ) play a more significant role on the disease dynamics than the parameters related to quarantine rate of susceptible individuals (q) and length of quarantine (r Q ). A contour plot of the quarantine reproduction number (R Q 0 ), as a function of h Q and q, is depicted in Fig. 9 , from which it follows that R Q 0 decreases with decreasing values of h Q and increasing values of q. Hence, this plot further supports the earlier result that the implementation of a quarantine strategy that reduces the infectiousness of quarantined-infected individuals (coupled with increased quarantine rate, q) will result in significant reduction of disease burden in the community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to a contagious disease is one of the oldest public health measures for combatting the spread of such contagious diseases in populations. This study presents a new deterministic model for Table 1 , with different values of q. Fig. 6 . Effect of duration of quarantine (1=r Q ) on the cumulative number of new Ebola cases.

assessing the population-level impact of the implementation of quarantine on the control of the 2014 Ebola outbreaks in West Africa. The model was fitted using data relevant to the EVD dynamics in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some of the notable features of the model include the explicit modeling of quarantine of both susceptible and infected individuals (in line with the approach by Lipsitch et al. (Lipsitch et al., 2003) ) and the assumption that quarantine is imperfect (so that disease transmission can occur during quarantine). Detailed theoretical analysis of a special case of the model, in the absence of quarantine and with constant total population, was carried out. The analysis revealed that the disease-free equilibrium of the resulting quarantine-free model is globally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological quantity (the basic reproduction number of the model, denoted by R 0 ) is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that, in the absence of quarantine, bringing R 0 to a value less than unity is necessary and sufficient for the effective control of the disease in the population. The quarantine-free model is also shown to have a unique endemic equilibrium (where Ebola persists in the population), which is globally-asymptotically stable, whenever R 0 > 1. The full model with quarantine was also analysed, from which it was deduced that adding imperfect quarantine to the quarantine-free model introduces a dynamic phenomenon (backward bifurcation) that was not present in the former model. Thus, the community-wide implementation of imperfect quarantine measures (except if implemented with high efficacy to minimize disease transmission during quarantine) may fail to lead to the effective control of the disease. The presence of backward bifurcation in the transmission dynamics of a disease makes its effective control more difficult (since a lot more effort is needed to reduce the associated reproduction number further below unity, outside the backward bifurcation region).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are carried out on the parameters of the model to assess the impact of uncertainties in the estimates of parameter values (on the numerical simulation results obtained) and determine the parameters that are most influential to the disease transmission dynamics (as measured in terms of the cumulative number of new infections). It was shown that while the current level and efficacy of quarantine significantly reduces the value of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of the model (hence, significantly reduces disease burden), it fails to bring this number to a value less than one (so that disease elimination is feasible). However, a modest increase in quarantine rate and/or the effectiveness level of quarantine (with respect to either reduction in the infectiousness of quarantined-infected individuals (h Q ) or Table 2 , with h Q ¼ 0:05; h Q ¼ 0:502 (fitted value), h Q ¼ 0:75 and h Q ¼ 1. minimizing contact during quarantine ðk Q Q Þ) can reduce the quarantine reproduction number of the model (R Q 0 ) to a value less than one (thereby making effective disease control or elimination feasible).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The results of the sensitivity analysis carried out show that the contact rate in the community (k), transmission probability per contact (b) and the mean duration before burying Ebola-deceased individuals (1=f ) have the most influence on the disease burden (as measured in terms of the cumulative number of new cases). Thus, these simulation results suggest that control measures that decrease the impact of these parameters (e.g., minimizing contacts with people suspected of the disease or reducing the time before an Ebola-deceased individual is buried) will be quite effective in minimizing disease burden. Our results suggest that the quarantine of susceptible individuals and the average duration in quarantine have a smaller effect on the number of infected, the modified transmission rate during quarantine and the contact rate for quarantined people have an important effect on the spread of the disease. The results of this study show that the prospects of the effective control of EVD using quarantine alone are bright, provided the coverage and effectiveness levels are high enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

74,9665e16e8fd0e3198298f64f70cc9180d1cea36a,"Microarray hybridization based identification of viral genotypes is increasingly assuming importance due to outbreaks of multiple pathogenic viruses affecting humans causing wide-spread morbidity and mortality. Surprisingly, microarray based identification of food-borne viruses, one of the largest groups of pathogenic viruses, causing more than 1.5 billion infections world-wide every year, has lagged behind. Cell-culture techniques are either unavailable or time consuming for routine application. Consequently, current detection methods for these pathogens largely depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, generally requiring an investigator to preselect the target virus of interest. Here we describe the first attempt to use the microarray as an identification tool for these viruses. We have developed methodology to synthesize targets for virus identification without using PCR, making the process genuinely sequence independent. We show here that a tiling microarray can simultaneously detect and identify the genotype and strain of common food-borne viruses in a single experiment.","Food related illnesses in the world are currently estimated at 1.5 billion annually, including 76 million in the United States [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . About one-third of these cases are due to viruses and bacteria, the remainder are attributed to chemical toxins [1, 2] . Enteric viruses are the principal agents for outbreaks of food related illness outbreaks world-wide and are responsible for an estimated 40-50 million illnesses each year in the United States [3] [4] [5] . Particularly vulnerable populations are children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, particularly among an older population [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . About 40 million (80%) of the illnesses are due to food-borne viruses that include noroviruses, hepatitis A and E viruses, adenovirus (types 41 and 42), rotavirus, as well as other RNA viruses groups thus far surpassing food-borne illnesses due to non-viral microbial pathogens [2, 3] . Mortality rate due to food-borne bacterial pathogens, mainly enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella enteritidis are marginally higher [7] .
The emergence of new human viral pathogens not previously known to cause human infections and/or human to human transmissions, such as the SARS coronavirus [8] , West Nile Virus [9] , Avian influenza virus [10, 11] , and swine fever virus [12] , has effected world-wide concerns of a pandemic outbreak. Such concerns have resulted in the expenditure of huge financial resources directed towards both prophylactic measures and outbreak containment. Similarly, the picture of food-borne infections is changing rapidly with the emergence of new viral strains linked to these infections, and the detection and identification of food-*Address correspondence to this author at the Division of Molecular Biology, OARSA, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, U.S Food and Drug Administration, Laurel, MD 20708, USA; Tel: 240-477-3363; E-mail: bisgoswami@gmail.com borne viral pathogens is thus a top priority for public health agencies.
Despite recent findings that suggest the growth phenotype of some food-borne virus strains is linked to the activation of the interferon controlled RNase L system [13] most food-borne viral pathogens remain refractory to growth in cultured cells [5, 14] . Indeed, any existing methods are currently impractical for rapid virus detection and identification, particularly when there is a need to applied detection methods for foods that are highly perishable and can contain cell culture inhibitory substances [5, 14] . For these reasons, there is an urgent need for the development of viral genome based rapid detection and identification methods for food-borne viruses with discriminatory power at the level of species and strain/genotype (or genogroup). Based on our previous results using a lower density array [15] as well as the work of others on non-food-borne viral pathogens [16] [17] [18] , microarray based methods offer one such methodological approach. Initial attempts at virus detection and typing by microarray hybridization were limited to detection of known mutations in the viral genome based on hybridization to a ""handful"" of oligonucleotide probes immobilized on a solid support. In the current investigation, we have successfully developed and applied a high density microarray to detection and identification of multiple viral species as well as virus strains within the same species. In addition, our results indicate the capacity of this methodology to discriminate between multiple virus species contained within the same sample.
Microarray Design and Fabrication. Throughout this manuscript, ""probes"" are used to mean oligonucleotides immobilized on the solid support, and ""targets"" are labeled cDNA sequences of the sample virus. Table 1 lists the selected enteric viruses and the number of probes for each strain of virus that were synthesized directly on the FDA_EVIR microarray by photolithography, whereby the total number of probes on the array is 91542. Selected regions of several enteric viral genomes were tiled at two nucleotide spacing, which means each succeeding oligo probe starts from the third nucleotide of the preceding oligo probe. Thus the approximately 91,000 probes can interrogate a total of more than 180,000 nucleotides. Since most enteric viruses have rather small genomes (approx. 7400 nucleotides), we were able to scan the genomes of a number of viruses. We also laid on the array a number of partial sequences in the database, particularly for norovirus. Each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap between consecutive probes for the same virus genotype; therefore, the complete array covers 183,084 nucleotides of viral genomic sequence. The number of probes for each group of virus range from 1113 for rotavirus (RV) group C segment IV to 18736 for norovirus (NV) genogroup II. The large range is due to the number and extent of independent genome sequences available for NV from GenBank. Norovirus genogroup II is represented by the largest number of probes due to a preponderance of partial sequences for these strains in GenBank. Generally, the short size of oligonucleotide probes on the array ensures that their binding to target sequences are sensitively affected by single base mismatches within a test genome that could be detected by a decrease in hybridization signal. Therefore, the tiling array design would allow detection of nucleotide changes by interrogating multiple neighboring probes.
All microarrays used in this study were customer ordered to be fabricated by Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) using a photolithographic array synthesis technology [19] . The tiling microarray was designed to detect common food-borne and fecally transmitted viruses including hepatitis A virus, norovirus, sapovirus, coxsackievirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, as well as hepatitis E virus. All viral genetic sequence data were obtained from the GenBank database of viral genomes. The tiling microarray chips were composed of overlapping 25mer oligonucleotides with a 2-nucleotide spacing whose sequences were derived from the 5' end viral genomes (3,700 nucleotides) of each virus except rotavirus. Sequence representation for this virus was derived from individual genome segments and ranged from approximately 2,300 to 3,300 nucleotides. Multiple sequences of partial genomes were also used as in the case, for example, of the HAV VP1-P2A junction. The genogroup (or genotype, serotype, group or partial genome) identification and the number of oligomer probes representing that particular group of genomes on the array is given in Table 1 . Microarray Hybridization, Scanning, and Data Analysis. Microarray hybridization was performed using the Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 l. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 m per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. [20] , and Ayodeji et al. [15] . Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3.0 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.
Validation of Norovirus Microarray Genotyping. To confirm the microarray genotyping result of the norovirus sample #186 (NoV#186), we performed a specific PCR with a published primer set G1SKF (5'-CTGCCCGAATTYGTA AATGA-3') and G1SKR (5'-CCAACCCARCCATTRTAC A-3'); G2SKF (5'-CNTGGGAGGGCGATCGCAA-3') and G2SKR (5'-CCRCCNGCATRHCCRTTRTACAT-3'; Y=C/T; N=A/T/G/C; R=A/G; H=A/T/C). These primer pairs were used for the amplification of genogroup I and group II norovirus. The PCR was carried out as described previously [21] . The amplicon was sequenced and its relationship to known NoV strains was determined by phylogenetics analysis program ClustalX as described by Thompson et al. [22] . A phylogenetic tree from boot-strap analysis was generated by Neighbor-Joining method. Other norovirus samples were genotyped by Dr. William Burkhardt (FDA, Dauphin Island, AL) and by Dr. Jan Vinje (CDC, Atlanta, GA) via RT-PCR. Fig. (1) shows the results of hybridization of the array probes to samples of coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus, and norovirus samples. Coxsackievirus samples CXKV B2, B3, B4 and A2 demonstrated clear-cut hybridization patterns. In CXKV A5, a minimal degree of cross-hybridization to A16, B3, B5 and A7 as well as B1 were also detected. The reason is the considerable localized sequence identity between different CXKV strains. However, their signal intensities were much lower than that of the probes from the same strain to targets derived from A5 itself (58.2-fold). For HAV, strong hybridization signals are only observed in HAVderived oligoprobes and genotypic-specific probes generate high intensity signals although cross-hybridization among strains is also observed, which reflects the sequence conservation within the HAV genus.
Interestingly, NoV#3263 and Norwalk virus hybridized strongly to the same array element derived from norogroup I strain sequence with GenBank accession #L07418. With noro#1 viral RNA, multiple hybridization bands belonging to NoV genogroup I (GI) are shown (Fig. 1D) . Multiple sequences of only norovirus genogroup I could be identified and none of them had any identity to those obtained with #3263 or Norwalk virus suggesting this strain (NoV #1) shares partial sequence identity with several other norogroup Fig. (2) . Analysis of sequence variation in HAV VP1/2A region. (A) Comparative hybridization profile of HM175/wt and HAS15 in relation to HM175/18f in VP1/2A region. Microarrays were hybridized to viral RNA isolated from the reference strain HM175/18f and test strain of HM175/wt and HAS15, respectively. The hybridization signal from each oligoprobe in that region within the reference strain was divided by the respective signal in the test virus. The signal ratio obtained from reference and test strain is shown with respect to genome position of 18f. The x axis is nucleotide position numbering of 18f. The y axis is the ratio measurement obtained. Hybridization peak indicates nucleotide changes present in the test strains. (B) Sequence alignment of VP1/2A region from the three strains.

I strains. In addition, strong hybridization to genogroup IIspecific probes derived from Saitama U17 strain with accession #AB039779 was identified in NoV#186. The phylogenetic tree of the PCR product by genogroup IIspecific primers indicated that NoV#186 amplified by G2SKF and G2SKR was clearly grouped into GII (Fig. 4C) in which it showed highest sequence similarity to Saitama U17 strain. This phylogenetic relationship is also reflected by the microarray hybridization pattern.
We have also examined whether individual virus strains can be identified by the tiling array, when multiple viruses are present in the same sample (Fig. 1E) . The ability of the microarray to accurately predict the genotypes of several different viruses led us to evaluate if the microarray can detect multiple unrelated viruses in the same experiment. We examined CXKV B3, HAV HM-175/18f and NoV #3263 RNAs as a mixture of labeled cDNA targets derived from their respective viruses hybridized to a single microarray. As shown in Fig. (1E) , the presence of CXKV B3 target and NoV#3263 can be readily identified by their strong hybridization to the set of oligoprobes derived from their individual genera sequence of CXKVB3 and L07418, respectively. Strong hybridization of HAV HM-175/18f target to the genotype IB probes is also observed in Fig.  (1E) , although some cross-hybridization to its close relative genotype IA oligoprobes also occurred, due to their high sequence similarity, albeit with a much lower signal intensities.
Hybridization of an oligonucleotide to target sequence is disrupted by a mismatch; decrease in hybridization in a Figs. (2, 3) , hybridization signal intensities of tiling probes matching the sequence of reference strain HM175 18f were compared. The ratios of hybridizations of the reference strain HM175 18f (perfect matches) to two test strains (HM175 wt and HAS15) were plotted. Peaks indicate decreased hybridization of the test strains due to nucleotide changes. The corresponding sequence alignment shown (Figs. 2B, 3B) validates the peaks of maximum destabilization by identifying the nucleotide changes in HAS 15. In contrast, comparison of HM175 and 18f, which differ by only 28 nucleotides over their entire 7.4 kb genome, show only three areas of nucleotide changes (red line) within the VP1/2A junction. In Fig. (4A, B) , we show that the analysis can be expanded over thousands of nucleotides of multiple viral genomes, where the first 3700 nucleotides of each virus strain were interrogated. Unlike in Figs. (2, 3) , where the ratio of hybridization of each 25mer oligonucleotide probe of a reference strain to a test strain was plotted to detect the location of a mutation, in Fig. (4A,  B) , the average signal value of all oligonucleotide probes from a virus strain was plotted against the position of that probe in the array, creating a unique profile for that virus (HAS 15 or PA21) to all other HAV strains we tested (data not shown). The results clearly show that signal strength was highest with multiple peaks in the region where HAV probes are positioned. There was no other area over the entire surface of the array where the target from any HAV strain produced a meaningful signal. This analysis was carried out with all HAV and CXKV strains listed in Table 1 (Supplement) and some norovirus (Fig.1D, E) .
There are currently two different types of microarrays commonly in use. The re-sequencing microarrays can identify base changes in an emerging strain by interrogating every base
The hybridization result from HAS 15 and PA 21, respectively, when the analysis was extended over 3.7 kb from the 5' end. Clearly HAV strains hybridized to probes from HAV strains only. Strong hybridization to the oligonucleotide probes derived from their respective subgenotype genomes represented on the array indicates the presence of these viruses.

in the genome by synthesizing four different oligonucleotides containing each base (N=A,T,G,C) at the central position [20] . The alternative and simpler array, called a tiling array, can cover an entire viral genome using overlapping oligonucleotides at two base intervals requiring one eighth the number of oligoprobes necessary to identify a change in the genome. In both cases oligonucleotides are synthesized in situ and immobilized on a solid support by a process called photolithography, whereby hundreds of thousands to millions of probes can be arrayed in a short time [19] . In the tiling array, a nucleotide change in the genome is identified by comparing the hybridization profile of a test virus to that of a reference strain matching the probe sequences. By avoiding PCR based target synthesis, the process is made independent of the sequence of the virus present in the sample (Fig. 1) .
Microarray hybridization based techniques for the identification of known mutations in viral genomes were initially performed by synthesizing a limited number of probes based on the sequence of wild-type viral and mutated genomes. The probes (individually synthesized) were immobilized on solid supports by hand spotting, and later by automated programmable applicators that could handle several hundred probes [8, 9, 23, 24] These approaches have been superseded by the newer photolithographic techniques.
Genotyping of large genomes did not take off until the development of in situ probe synthesis and immobilization techniques mentioned above by Maskos and Southern [25] , Pease et al. [26] , and Nuwaysir et al. [27] . In our study, we sought to take advantage of the high resolution power of the tiling array to differentiate among viral subtypes, which is particularly challenging for other traditional methods.
Our hybridization data clearly show that unamplified target cDNA synthesized by reverse transcription and labeled postsynthetically (Supplement) can be hybridized to probes in a high density array and individual virus strains can be identified either by comparison to a reference strain or by the hybridization profile of the entire array ( Fig. 1A-D) regardless of their genome sequence. The high sensitivity of the assay is achieved by two cycles of hybridization signal amplification as described in Methods. The detection limit is approximately 10,000 viral genomes.
To guarantee the accuracy of identification by the tiling array, our approach involves the design of multiple oligonucleotide probes having similar specificities for the same target. This strategy offers possibilities to compensate for the lack of specificity on the single probe level. Viruses representing on the microarray were readily detected and identified by specific hybridization to the appropriate oligonucleotide probe sets, even within the same virus genus. The cross-hybridization of some CXKV strains to a limited number of oligo probes from a different strain marked areas of extensive sequence homology, when the sequence of different strains were aligned (data not shown). The specificity of the assay is exemplified by the fact that there was never any crosshybridization detected between CXKV, HAV and norovirus probes to the non-target sequences.
We believe this methodology has the potential as a rapid alternative to conventional RT-PCR for the simultaneous detection and species/genotype identification of common food-borne viruses. This approach also allows identification of pathogens (e.g., NoV#186) whose sequences are not tiled on the array, expanding the repertoire of identifiable pathogens and their variant strains. These results demonstrate the discriminatory power of this array technology particularly when applied in combination with our amplification methodology.",Detection and Identification of Common Food-Borne Viruses with a Tiling Microarray,"Chen, Haifeng; Mammel, Mark; Kulka, Mike; Patel, Isha; Jackson, Scott; Goswami, Biswendu B.",Open Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109525/,150,2947,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,f9738261ac322d052e519fb1f1297eedc917a939,"Background: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a Paramyxovirus known to cause acute respiratory tract infections in children and young adults. To date, there is no study from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia determining the proportion and severity of hMPV infection among pediatric hospitalized patients with respiratory infections. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the presence of hMPV antigens in the nasopharyngeal secretions of pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infections in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: This prospective, serological hospital-based study included all pediatric patients who were admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to November 2017 with upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Basic demographics of patients and their clinical data on and after admission were recorded. Direct fluorescent antibody assay was used to detect the presence of hMPV antigens in the obtained nasopharyngeal secretion specimens. Results: During the study, 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized due to upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, of which 9.9% were positive for hMPV. These patients were aged 9 months to 16 years, were from Abha city or its surrounding localities and were mostly (77.8%) hospitalized during autumn or winter. The most common diagnosis on admission was bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%), and some patients also had underlying chronic conditions such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%).
The results obtained indicated that hMPV is a potential etiologic factor for the commonly occurring acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. hMPV infection was also found to be associated with complicated respiratory conditions such as bronchopneumonia, chronic heart disease and bronchial asthma.","Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a single-stranded RNA-enveloped virus, recently classified in the order Mononegavirales, family Pneumoviridae, genus Metapneumovirus and species hMPV. It was first isolated in the Netherlands by van den Hoogen et al., [1, 2] and is now a known causative agent of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and adults. hMPV infections have been reported in Australia, [3] Canada, [4] the United States, [5] the United Kingdom, [6] Hong Kong, [7] South Africa, [8] Mexico, [9] Spain [10] and Peru. [11] However, in the Middle East, there have only been few reports of hMPV infections, mainly as sporadic infections in Egypt, [12] Jordan, [13] Kuwait [14] and Saudi Arabia. [15] Along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, hMPV is now recognized as a primary etiologic agent for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in pediatrics. [16, 17] In a study from Mexico, it was found that the number of hMPV infections increased in children aged 24-36 months as compared with those in younger age groups, whereas RSV infections were inversely proportional to increase in age. [9] Co-infection with both viruses can also occur, resulting in a more complicated and serious clinical disease. [3, 18] In addition to the pediatric population, studies have also found hMPV to infect adults [19] and elderly people. [20] In terms of transmission, hMPV spreads through contact with contaminated secretions, i.e., droplet, aerosol or fomites. Hospital-acquired hMPV infections have also been reported. [5] In young children, infections are usually not asymptomatic, and bronchiolitis, with or without pneumonia, is the most common associated presentation. [18, 20, 21] Other reported conditions include bronchial asthma exacerbation, otitis media, pneumonitis, flu-like illness and community-acquired pneumonia. [9] In adults, hMPV has been associated with bronchitis, pneumonia and exacerbations of both bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [22, 23] In terms of detection, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a sensitive and commonly used method to detect hMPV. [5] Real-time RT-PCR is also commonly used for detecting hMPV in clinical specimens with many genomic target sequences. [24, 25] A touch-down genomic amplification protocol for the diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections has also been used previously. [26] The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for hMPV diagnosis is a simple and specific serological test for anti-hMPV antibodies detection. [27] Immunofluorescence using specific antibodies is routinely used for detecting hMPV antigens, particularly in epidemiological studies. [28] However, cell culturing techniques have a low sensitivity in detecting hMPV from respiratory tract secretions, as the virus exhibits extremely limited types of cell tropism. [2, 10, 29, 30] In Saudi Arabia, there is a paucity of data regarding the occurrence of hMPV and its role in complicated clinical cases of commonly reported respiratory infections. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the role of hMPV in the respiratory tract infections' severity and complications among hospitalized children in the Aseer region, where no such study has previously been conducted.
The study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Ethical Committee of College of Medicine, King Khalid University, Saudi Arabia (KKU Research Ethics Committee Meeting No. REC # 2014-01-08; dated January 5, 2014)
This prospective, serological study included pediatric patients who were admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to November 2017 with upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Aseer Central Hospital is the largest tertiary care referral hospital in the Aseer region, and thus its sample is representative of the area.
Data such as age, gender, clinical presentation and current medications were collected using an objectively prepared questionnaire. Informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of all patients before sample collection.
Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected from all hospitalized patients included in this study using the standard collection method. Briefly, physicians collected the nasopharyngeal secretions with the help of a sterile feeding tube connected to a vacuum pump. Following the vacuum application, the tip of the tube was cut and placed into a sterile container labelled with the patient's name and identification number. The container was then transported to the Virology Laboratory at the Department of Microbiology and Clinical Parasitology, College of Medicine, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia, and either processed on the same day or stored at −70°C.
Specimens were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions for the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) kit (Oxoid Ltd., Cambridge, UK) with minor modifications. Samples were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.5). The specimens were gently vortexed for 30 s to reduce the viscosity and dilute the mucus. Samples were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min to separate the cells from the mucus. The supernatant was removed, and the cells in the pellets were used for DFA staining. The authors chose to use DFA because it has been found to be a useful technique for wider hMPV epidemiological studies. [31] Preparation of cells
The cell suspension was washed several times with PBS and the final cell deposit was resuspended in 2 mL PBS (pH 7.5). The cells were then gently agitated by pipetting up and down until the cellular material was released from the mucus. Additional PBS was added until a smooth suspension was obtained, and any visible flecks of mucus were removed. After the cell separation process was completed, the obtained cell suspension was centrifuged at room temperature (15°C-30°C) for 10 min at 3500 rpm and the supernatant was discarded. The final cell deposit was resuspended in PBS to dilute any remaining mucus and maintain high cell density.
A volume of 25 µl of the resuspended cell deposit was placed in slides with 6-mm-diameter wells. The specimens were then allowed to air dry thoroughly and fixed with fresh acetone at room temperature (15°C-30°C) for 10 min. The slide was air-dried after fixation. A volume of 25 µl of IMAGEN™ hMPV reagent (Oxoid Ltd., Cambridge, UK), which contains monoclonal antibodies against hMPV conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, was added to the fixed cell preparation on the slide to cover the wells. The same amount was also added to the positive control slide. The slides were then incubated with the reagent in a moist chamber for 15 min at 37°C. Following incubation, excess reagent was washed off with PBS, and the slide was gently washed in an agitating bath containing PBS for 5 min. The PBS was drained off, and slide was allowed to air dry at room temperature (15°C-30°C). One drop of IMAGEN™ hMPV mounting fluid was added to the center of each well, and cover-slip was placed over the mounting fluid and specimen to ensure that there are no trapped air bubbles. The stained slides were immediately examined under epifluorescence microscope at ×400 and then ×1000. Apple-green fluorescence was observed in the cells infected with hMPV, whereas non-infected cells appeared as red color because they were stained with the Evans blue counterstain. Images of these cells were captured using a microscopic camera (Nikon-DS-Fi1, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and archived.
During the study, a total of 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized based on upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Of these 9 (9.9%) patients tested positive for hMPV antigens, as demonstrated by DFA from the nasopharyngeal secretions [ Figure 1 ]. Table 1 provides the demographic and clinical presentation data of all hMPV-positive patients. The age of these patients ranged from 9 months to 16 years and all were Saudi nationals except one infant, who was a Jordanian by nationality but was born and raised in Saudi Arabia.
From the patient's demographics, it was observed that hMPV antigens were detected not only in patients from Abha but also among those from its bordering areas, namely, Algahama, Bilahmar, Ahud Rufida, Sarat Abeedah, Khamis Mushait and Bilasmer. Three of the nine positive cases were found from Abha (33.3%), and one positive case from each of the previously mentioned six cities was reported (11.1%). Of the nine hMPV-positive patients, seven (77.8%) were hospitalized during the autumn and winter of 2016-2017. In the hMPV-positive patients, the symptoms included fever (77.8%), cough (77.8), shortness of breath (66.7%), nasal congestion (11.1%), cyanosis (11.1%) and stridor (11.1%). These patients also had underlying chronic illnesses such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%), and most had tachypnea (88.8%). On physical examinations, bilateral crepitation and wheezing were found to be the major findings along with bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%).
In Saudi Arabia, although few studies have reported the incidence, epidemiological elements and genetic diversity of hMPV in some regions, [15, 32, 33] there are no reports on the association between hMPV infections and the clinical presentations of respiratory tract infections among pediatrics. The current study found that in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia, about 10% of hospitalization among pediatrics with respiratory tract infections between July 2016 and November 2017 was due to hMPV infections. In addition, this study also found that hMPV infections were associated with presentation of acute respiratory symptoms, thereby highlighting the role of the infection in complicating the course of the disease.
The results of the present study concur with several other studies demonstrating an association between hMPV infection and acute respiratory conditions such as bronchopneumonia and pneumonia. [3, 5] A previous study implicated hMPV as a causative agent for severe and acute respiratory infections among pediatric patients, [34] which is similar to the findings of the current study. Another study found that children with hMPV infection are likely to have immunodeficiency; however, the current study was not able to substantiate these findings as none of the patients were found to be immunocompromised. [13] The prevalence of hMPV infection of the current study (about 10%) was similar to that reported in studies from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. [14, 15] However, other similar studies that used direct immunofluorescence assays for the detection of hMPV antibodies in sera of patients revealed much higher prevalence rates. [35] This suggests that different results can be obtained with different diagnostic techniques for hMPV infection. In the current study, we used DFA with monoclonal antibody, which has previously been shown to have 100% specificity, thereby indicating the reliability of our results. [31] The current study did not find any gender predilection in terms of the infections; these findings are in accordance with that of Bastien et al. [4] and Kahn. [29] In this study, all nine hMPV-positive children were from Abha or its surrounding areas. These areas are known for their high altitude, low temperature and low oxygen tension. It was well known that the prevalence of viral respiratory infections is high in cold and dry areas. [36] In addition, almost 78% of the hMPV-positive cases were in children who had been admitted during the autumn and winter seasons. It is also known that the majority of the viruses responsible for bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia have their peak infectivity during winter and late autumn, with only sporadic cases through other seasons. [37, 38] The hMPV-positive patients in the current study had fever, cough, nasal congestion, cyanosis, stridor and shortness of breath, while some also had underlying chronic illnesses such as chronic heart disease and bronchial asthma; similar hMPV-associated illnesses were observed in another study. [39] Physical examination revealed wheezing and bilateral crepitation and clinically, the most common presentations were bronchopneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. These findings are in line with those of Williams et al., [40] who found significant association between hMPV and wheezing exacerbations and/or bronchiolitis in infants and young children.
In the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia, hMPV was found to be responsible for about one-tenth of hospitalizations in children with acute respiratory tract infections. This study also confirmed that hMPV infection is associated with presentation of acute respiratory symptoms.",Human metapneumovirus in Pediatric Patients with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in the Aseer Region of Saudi Arabia,"Alsuheel, Ali Mohammed; Ali, Abdelwahid Saeed; Al-Hakami, Ahmed Musa; Shati, Ayed Abdullah; Chandramoorthy, Harish C.; Al-Qahtani, Saleh Mohammed",Saudi J Med Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503696/,278,1942,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy can reconstitute CD8 T cell immunity in chronic patients. We cloned 10 virus-specific TCRs targeting 5 different viruses, causing chronic and acute infection. All 10 TCR genetic constructs were optimized for expression using a P2A sequence, codon optimization and the addition of a non-native disulfide bond. However, maximum TCR expression was only achieved after establishing the optimal orientation of the alpha and beta chains in the expression cassette; 9/10 TCRs favored the beta-P2A-alpha orientation over alpha-P2A-beta. Optimal TCR expression was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of IFN-gamma1 T cells. In addition, activating cells for transduction in the presence of Toll-like receptor ligands further enhanced IFN-gamma production. Thus, we have built a virus-specific TCR library that has potential for therapeutic intervention in chronic viral infection or virus-related cancers.","Restoration of antigen-specific T cell immunity has the potential to clear persistent viral infection.

Thus, we have built a virus-specific TCR library that has potential for therapeutic intervention in chronic viral infection or virus-related cancers. C D8 T cells are a critical component to clearing or controlling viral infections. Lack of a virus-specific T cell response is associated with failure to control chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 1 and loss of virusspecific T cells due to immune suppression during hematopoietic stemcell or solid organ transplant can lead to life-threatening Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infections 2 . Reconstitution of virus-specific immunity, either through bone marrow transplant [3] [4] [5] or adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells 6, 7 , can control these persistent infections. In addition, data from influenza has demonstrated that pre-existing virus-specific T cell immunity can protect against lethal infection 8, 9 . Therefore, strategies to manipulate the virus-specific T cell response could lead to clinical therapies to treat chronic infections or prevent mortality related to severe acute infections.
Given their critical role in controlling infection, combined with the difficulty in generating virus-specific T cells for adoptive cell therapy, we have explored T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer to engineer antiviral T cell immunity. By introducing exogenous antigen specific TCRs cloned from patients able to control infection we could engineer fully functional virus-specific T cells to acutely infecting viruses, such as SARS corona virus 10 , and viruses causing chronic infections, such as HBV 11 . The HBV-specific T cells engineered in patients with chronic infection recognized infected cells and tumor cells expressing viral antigen as a tumor-associated antigen, which is known to occur in HBV and EBV associated cancers 7, 12 .
Our goal was to harness the potential of TCR gene transfer and develop a virus-specific TCR library, optimized and ready for clinical use. We expanded virus-specific T cells from healthy and resolved donors and cloned 10 virus-specific TCRs to 5 different viruses restricted to 4 HLA class-I molecules commonly found in the general population. To establish a standardized TCR gene cassette we employed previously published methods to optimize TCR expression with minimal modification to the wild type amino acid sequence [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Our library of 10 TCRs ideally positioned us to probe the specific effects of simple modifications, such as inverting the orientation of the TCR alpha and beta genes in the expression cassette, which led to a significant increase in TCR expression and cytokine production. We also found that the function (IFN-c production) of engineered T cells could be further augmented with the addition of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to the culture during the transduction procedure; increasing the frequency of IFN-c producing cells up to 70%. The core library of virus-specific TCRs presented here, each one optimized for expression in primary human T cells, could provide a steppingstone to effective treatments for viral infections.
Building a virus-specific T cell receptor library. We used a panel of previously identified viral epitopes from HBV, EBV, CMV, FLU and SARS to expand T cells from healthy donors or patients with resolved HBV and SARS infections (Table 1) . Antigen-specific T cells were identified using matching HLA-pentamers/tetramers or the CD107a degranulation assay and clonal populations were derived by limiting dilution cloning or sorting T cells using antibodies specific for the variable region of TCR beta chains. Total RNA was extracted from sorted clones and the wild type TCR alpha and beta genes were cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR with TCR constant region gene specific primers. The TCRs were cloned into the MP-71 retroviral vector 18 and tested for expression in primary human T cells.
Optimizing virus-specific TCR expression in primary human T cells. The wild type alpha and beta TCR pair was originally tested for expression by co-transducing two separate vectors carrying the TCR alpha and beta genes ( Fig. 1A; a 1 b) . To begin optimizing TCR expression, we made stepwise advancements in the TCR constructs based on published literature using 3 different virus-specific TCRs. The TCRs were linked together with a 2A autocleavage site and flexible spacer 13, 14 to promote equimolar production of the alpha and beta chains and codon optimized to increase translational efficiency 17 . These constructs were then modified with a nonnative cysteine disulfide bond in the constant region to increase pairing and stability of the exogenous TCR 15, 16 .
As previously demonstrated, codon optimization and incorporating the alpha and beta genes into a single cassette increased TCR expression in all three TCRs compared to wild type TCRs on separate vectors (Fig. 1A) . We did not see substantial differences in the frequency of HLA-multimer positive cells between single cassette constructs with and without the additional disulfide bond ( Fig. 1A ; a-b-Opt vs a-bcys-Opt). However, there was a clear advantage with the inclusion of an additional disulfide bond. The HLA-multimer positive CD8 T cell population showed much more defined staining and a higher mean fluorescence intensity in 2 out of 3 TCRs (Fig. 1B) . We also observed that the additional disulfide bond increased fluorescence intensity in the non-CD8 T cell population. Therefore, all subsequent TCR expression cassettes employed the 2A cleavage site with codon optimization and the additional disulfide bond to maximize pairing.
Orientation of the TCR gene cassette significantly impacts expression. There is evidence that the orientation of the TCR alpha and beta genes within the cassette can impact their expression 19 . Therefore, we synthesized codon optimized constructs linked with the P2A cleavage site in both orientations and tested TCR expression in primary human T cells ( Fig. 2A) . Where available, we monitored TCR expression with beta chain specific antibodies and HLApentamers/tetramers. Interestingly, in 9/10 of the TCRs tested, expression of the introduced TCR was better (higher frequency of TCR1 cells) when the TCR beta gene was upstream of the TCR alpha gene in the expression cassette. This was true for staining the beta chain ( Fig. 2B&C ) or with HLA-pentamers/tetramers (Fig. 2E&F ).
This demonstrates that there is a positive (high frequency) and a negative (low frequency) orientation for each TCR alpha and beta gene pair. When we classified expression based on this positive/ negative orientation we observed a statistically significant increase in the frequency of TCR1 T cells, with a mean of 35.3 vs 22.45 for beta chain expression (Fig. 2D ) and 19.49 vs 8.74 for HLA multimer staining respectively (Fig. 2G ). The fold increase in expression differed for each TCR but overall we observed a mean fold increase of 1.9 in beta chain expression and 4.2 for multimer staining (Table 1) in the optimal orientation. TCR cassette orientation and T cell function. Next, we determined if the increased TCR expression correlated with an increase in the frequency of functional cells. Primary human T cells transduced with both orientations of the TCR cassette were stimulated with specific peptides presented on either HLA-A21 T2 cells or HLA-matched EBV transformed B cell lines. IFN-c production, analyzed by flow cytometry, was used to monitor the frequency of virus-specific CD8 T cells (Fig. 3A) . T cell cytokine production mirrored TCR expression and there was clearly a positive and negative orientation for each TCR construct. Nine out of 10 TCRs resulted in higher frequencies of IFN-c1 T cells in the beta-P2A-alpha orientation whereas only one TCR was superior in the alpha-P2Abeta orientation (Fig. 3B ). When TCRs were grouped according to their positive and negative orientation, we observed a significant difference in their overall functionality, 26.86% vs 12.89% IFN-c1 CD8 T cells (Fig. 3C) . This translated to a 2.7 fold increase overall in the frequency of IFN-c producing T cells with the optimal orientation of the TCR cassette (Table 1) .
In a subset of TCR transduced T cells we also analyzed the production of TNF-a and IL-2. Similar to the results with IFN-c, we found that the optimal orientation of the TCR expression cassettes resulted in an increase in the frequency of TNF-a and IL-2 producing cells within the population of transduced T cells (Fig. 3 D&E) . These data confirm that, in addition to codon optimization and adding the TCR alpha and beta chains to a single cassette, the simple modification of inverting the TCR alpha and beta chain orientation can have a significant impact on TCR expression and T cell function in engineered T cells.
Enhancing the functionality of engineered T cells using synthetic TLR agonists. Once the optimal orientation of the TCR was identified, we focused on augmenting the function of engineered T cells. Adjuvants based on Toll-like receptor ligands can have direct effects on T cells 20 and be selected to mimic infecting pathogens 21 . We used TLR ligands that frequently signal viral infection: polyI:C (TLR-3), Imiquimod (TLR-7), ssRNA40 (TLR-8) and CpG (TLR-9). The TLR ligands were added to the PBMC during the first 48 h of activation prior to transduction. At the time of transduction, the media was changed, the primary T cells were transduced and allowed to expand for 10 days. Following their expansion, we tested TCR expression using HLA-pentamers to determine if the TLR ligands affected TCR expression compared to the standard protocol with IL-2 alone. The TCR presented in Figure 4 (HBV core 18-27) has high affinity for its cognate peptide-MHC, allowing us to monitor TCR expression in both the CD8 and CD4 T cell population using the HLA-pentamer (Fig. 1A) . We found that the addition of TLR ligands to the culture during the first 48 h of activation had little impact on HLA pentamer staining in either the CD8 or CD4 T cell population ( Fig. 4 A,B ,E). However, we observed clear differences in the frequency of functional cells. The addition of polyI:C or ssRNA40 increased the frequency of IFN-c producing CD8 and CD4 T cells compared to IL-2 alone, IL-2 plus CpG or Imiquimod (Fig. 4 C,F ). This increase in the frequency of IFN-c producing cells translated into a 60% and 80% increase in functional CD8 T cells following addition of polyI:C and ssRNA40 respectively to the culture medium (Fig. 4D ). Similar results were observed with CD4 T cells, with ssRNA40 stimulating the greatest increase in IFN-c1 T cell frequency (Fig. 4G) .
Addition of TLR agonists promotes Th1 polarization. To investigate the discrepancy between HLA-pentamer positive cells and IFN-c positive cells in cultures with polyI:C or ssRNA40 (Fig. 4B -D) we analyzed the supernatant taken from cultures after the 48 h incubation with anti-CD3, IL-2 and TLR ligands. We tested for the production of 42 different cytokines in cultures derived from 3 separate healthy donors and measured significant production of 27 different cytokines. We found that addition of TLR ligands generally reduced the production of immunoregulatory/Th2 cytokines compared to IL-2 alone (Fig. 5A) . This was especially true for ssRNA40 in all cases except the increased production in IL-10; observed with both polyI:C and ssRNA40. In coordination with the reduced production of regulatory cytokines we observed increased production of inflammatory cytokines. In particular, the Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12p70 was significantly increased with ssRNA40 and mildly increased with polyI:C (Fig. 5B) .
We then tested whether the inflammatory environment led to increased Th1 polarization or caused non-specific bystander activation to account for the increase in IFN-c1 T cells. Unlike figure 4 , where HLA-pentamer and IFN-c staining were performed in separate assays, we measured IFN-c production in HLA pentamer1 or TCR Vbeta1 cells to measure cytokine production in TCR transduced cells.
As above, HLA pentamer staining was similar between the different conditions (Fig. 6A ). The addition of polyI:C and ssRNA40 increased the frequency of IFN-c1 T cells compared to IL-2 alone (Fig. 6B) . We observed an increase in IFN-c1/pentamer1 T cells with polyI:C and ssRNA40 compared to IL-2 alone (Fig. 6C) , indicating increased polarization of pentamer positive cells to a Th1 phenotype. However, only approximately 70% of the IFN-c1 cells were pentamer positive, regardless of the condition (Fig. 6B&C ). This leaves a significant number of IFN-c1 T cells that either express too little TCR to stain with pentamer or are responding as non-specific bystanders in the co-culture.
Next, we analyzed IFN-c production in Vbeta1 T cells. The advantage of Vbeta staining is that nearly all T cells expressing our introduced TCR, whether is it properly paired with the correct alpha chain or not, will be stained by the antibody. Therefore, Vbeta staining may detect T cells producing IFN-c that do not express enough of the introduced TCR for HLA-pentamer staining. Similar to pentamer staining, TCR beta chain expression was similar across all conditions (Fig. 6D ) and the frequency of IFN-c1 T cells increased with the addition of polyI:C and ssRNA40 (Fig. 6E) . Unlike T cells stained with pentamers, we found that nearly all (<90%) of the IFN-c1 cells following peptide-specific activation were TCR V beta positive (Fig. 6E&F) . These data indicate that IFN-c production was specific to the introduced TCR. They also confirm increased Th1 polarization as cells shift from Vbeta1/IFN-c-to Vbeta1/IFN-c1 with the addition of TLR ligands to the culture. Therefore, similar to their role in natural infection, combining T cell activation in the presence of TLR ligation led to an inflammatory environment during the activation phase for transduction and translated into a greater frequency of IFN-c producing T cells.
As a final characterization of their function, and to determine whether culturing in different conditions altered transduced T cell cytotoxic function, we compared the ability of T cells transduced with the HBV core antigen-specific TCR to lyse hepatocyte-like cell lines (HepG2) expressing HBV antigens. We found that T cells cultured under any of the conditions exhibited efficient and similar lysis of targets expressing the HBV core antigen (HG2cAg). We observed 95% specific lysis at a 155 E5T ratio and 80% specific lysis at a 1510 E5T ratio (Fig. 6G) . Co-culture with HepG2 cells expressing the irrelevant HBV surface antigen (HG2sAg) did not result in any significant lysis. We were unable to titrate the cytotoxicity experiment for sensitivity as the antigen in HepG2 cells is produced from a CMV promoter following transduction with a lentiviral vector. However, this data demonstrated that transduced T cells cultured under any condition tested are specific and highly cytotoxic.
Numerous sophisticated approaches have been developed to optimize the TCR expression cassette 14, 19, 22, 23 , pairing of the introduced TCR 24-29 and function/maturation of the resulting T cell population 30, 31 . These approaches have largely been based on the modification of a single TCR in each study. We chose the simplest modifications previously reported in the literature and applied them to our library of 10 different virus-specific TCRs to optimize TCR expression and the antiviral potential of redirected primary human T cells. In line with previous reports, we observed that codon optimization, linking the alpha and beta chains with a P2A sequence, including a glycine-serine-glycine spacer, and the addition of a non-native cysteine disulfide bond in the TCR constructs led to increased expression and pairing. Surprisingly, when we tested whether simply inverting the orientation of the alpha and beta genes within the TCR expression cassette impacted TCR expression and function we found evidence for clear positive (high frequency) and negative (low frequency) orientation. In 9/10 of the TCRs, placing the beta chain upstream of the P2A sequence resulted in enhanced expression. This enhanced expression translated to increased HLA-multimer staining in the non-CD8 T cell population as well, comprised primarily of CD4 T cells, which provide help for virus specific CD8 T cells in vivo 32 .
The difference in expression of the TCR beta chain between the different orientations was less pronounced than that observed for HLA multimer staining. There was only a 1.9 fold increase in TCR beta expression dependent on the orientation, suggesting that translation of the proteins was similar despite orientation of the TCR cassette. In contrast, we observed a 4.2 fold increase in HLA multimer staining that was dependent on the orientation. The discrepancy between these two observations remains unclear. Unlike internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), the P2A linker results in nearly equimolar production of both the alpha and beta chains 13 . Therefore, there should be equal production despite the orientation. The difference may be related to the stability of individual TCR alpha and beta proteins. The TCR alpha chain is rapidly targeted for ER associated degradation. This is the rate-limiting step in TCR complex expression in developing thymocytes 33 and this instability carries over to TCR expression in mature T cells 34, 35 . Therefore, translating the beta chain first may facilitate TCR alpha/beta heterodimer formation and stability; as the downstream alpha chain is translated it can rapidly pair with beta.
In some TCRs, the two different orientations (a-P2A-b and b-P2A-a) resulted in nearly equal expression. This similarity between orientations was primarily observed in TCRs with the highest TCR V beta expression (.25% of CD8 T cells). These TCRs may be particularly stable and thus expression is not influenced so significantly by endogenous TCRs. The end result is that a majority of the TCR cassettes have an optimal orientation and testing both can be an easy solution that significantly increases expression.
The functional impact of optimal TCR orientation was observed in the ability of redirected cells to produce antiviral cytokines in response to their cognate epitopes. The optimal orientation of the TCR cassette not only increased the frequency of cells capable of producing IFN-c but it also increased the multi-functionality of the total T cell population; increasing the frequency of both IL-2 and TNF-a producing T cells.
In addition to optimizing TCR expression we also focused on augmenting redirected T cell function. Instead of using cytokines or specific T cell populations during transduction 30,31 , we added TLR agonists to the culture to mimic pathogen signals encountered during infection. Addition of the TLR ligands had only a minor effect on TCR expression. We observed a slight increase in pentamer positive CD8 T cells with ssRNA40 but the most significant difference was observed in the function of the redirected T cell population. We observed increases in the frequency of IFN-c producing cells with polyI:C (TLR-3) and ssRNA40 . This increase in IFN-c1 cells was related to increased polarization.
Our data suggests that TLR ligands help polarize T cells during the activation phase through reduced production of regulatory and Th2associated cytokines and increased the production of inflammatory and Th1-associated cytokines. Not all IFN-c1 T cell stained positive with HLA pentamers, indicating that cells that do not express enough properly paired TCR to bind HLA mulitmers but remained functional. This was confirmed by co-staining IFN-c1 T cells with TCR beta chain antibodies. Approximately 90% or greater of the IFN-c1 T cells were also positive for the introduced beta chain, suggesting that nearly all responding cells are epitope-specific through the introduced TCR. It has been established that T cells remain functional with only a fraction of their TCR on the surface, as low at 5% in one study 36 . Thus, the use of TLR ligands during T cell activation may help to maximize the pool of functional T cells for adoptive cell therapy.
In conclusion, we have developed a virus-specific T cell receptor library targeting different viral infections. Using straightforward approaches we optimized TCR expression and tried to minimize alterations to the wild type amino acid sequence to reduce potential immunogenicity 37 . The modifications led to increased TCR expression and function. Banks of ready-made virus-specific T cells for adoptive cell therapy are being used 38 and the ability to generate unlimited numbers of highly efficient virus-specific T cells using TCR gene transfer could facilitate this approach.
Patient samples and isolation. Blood was obtained from healthy donors under informed consent or purchased as anonymous buffy coats from the Blood Donation Center at the National University Hospital, Singapore. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the National University Hospital, Singapore. Blood from resolved HBV patients was obtained at the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Italy, under informed consent and approved by the local Ethics Committee. Blood from resolved SARS patients was collected at the Singapore General Hospital under informed consent approved by the Centralized Institutional Review Board of the Singapore Health Services Pte, Ltd. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the ethics committees. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (GE healthcare) and HLA-typed to four digit resoltuion. Peptide-specific T cell expansion. PBMC with HLA matching the restriction of the synthetic peptides were expanded with 1 mg/ml of each peptide for 10 d in AIM-V medium (Invitrogen) with 2% human AB serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 U/ml II-2 (R&D Systems). Cultures were tested for positive responses using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-c. Briefly, T cells were stimulated for 5 h with 1 mg/ml of the peptide in the presence of 10 mg/ml of Brefeldin A. The cells were stained with anti-CD8 PE-Cy7 (BD Pharmingen) for 15 min on ice, wahsed and fixed using Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) for 20 min on ice. Following fixation/ permeabilization, cells were stained with anti-IFNc PE (BD Biosciences) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed and then resuspended in 13 PBS for acquisition on the Facs Canto (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FACs Diva software.
Postive responses were restimulated to increase frequency and numbers of peptidespecific T cells. Peptide-specific T cell cultures (5 3 10 5 ) were co-cultured with irradiated (2500 rads) healthy donor PBMC (1.7 3 10 6 ) and HLA-matched EBV transformed B cell lines (3 3 10 5 ) loaded with peptide for 1 h at room temperature. Restimulated T cells were cultured in AIM-V media supplemented with 2% AB serum, 20 U/ml IL-2, 10 ng/ml IL-7 and 10 ng/ml IL-15 (R&D Systems). Functionality was tested again 10 d after restimulation using the CD107a degranulation assay to maintain cell viability. The TCR variable beta chain staining panel IO Test Beta Mark TCR V kit (Beckman Coulter) was used to determine the immunodominant Vb on CD107a1 cells following peptide stimulation.
Isolation of Ag-specific T cells. Expanded T cell lines were stimulated with 1 ug/ml of peptide for 2 h in the presence of anti-CD107a-APC at 37uC and washed once before staining for immunodominant Vb, identified using the screening panel, for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed once and passed through a 70 uM cell strainer and resuspended in sterile PBS. Peptide-specific T cells were sorted using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) on a FACss Aria III (BD Biosciences) by gating on CD107a1Vb1 cells.
Cloning of TCRa and TCRb chains. Total RNA was isolated from the sorted cells using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the 59 GeneRacer Core kit according the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). PrimeSTAR MAX (Takara, Bio) was used to amplify the target gene using 59 GeneRacer primer and 39 Gene-specific primers for the TCR alpha constant domain (TCAGCTGGACCACAGCCGCAGC) and two alleles for the TCR beta constant domain (Beta C1 5 TCAGAAATCCTTTCTCTTGACCATGGC; Beta C2 5 CTAGCCTCTGGAATCCTTTCTCTTG). The PCR products were ligated into TOPO-vector for bacterial transformation. Colonies were screened using the same primer pair as mentioned above to verify insert and then sequenced (AITBiotech). The sequences obtained were BLAST against the Human TCR database online (IMGT/V-Quest, http://www.imgt.org) to identify the components of the TCRs. Upon identification of the alpha and beta chains, functional confirmation was performed using the wild type sequences before synthesizing the P2A-linked single cassette, codon optimized, cystine-modified gene constructs (Genescript). The gene cassettes consisting of VaCa-P2A-VbCb and VbCb-P2A-VaCa orientations were tested for expression and functionality in primary human T cells.
TCR introduction into primary T cells. Retroviral vector, MP71, was used to deliver the TCR genes into the primary human T cells. 2 3 10 6 Phoenix amphotropic packaging cells were seeded into 100 mm tissue culture dishes 24 h prior to transfection. Phoenix cells were transiently co-transfected using calcium phosphate with 9 mg each of MP71-TCR Va, MP71-TCR Vb together with 6 mg of amphotropic envelope (PCL-Amp) for 24 h. For P2A-linked constructs, 18 mg of the TCR plasmid was co-transfected with 6 mg of the amphotropic envelope. After 24 h, IMDM was replaced with Aim-V supplemented with 2% human AB serum and phoenix cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before retroviral supernatants were collected for transduction.
PBMC were stimulated with 600 U/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2; R&D Systems) and 50 ng/ml anti-CD3 (OKT-3; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for 48 h. Untreated 24 well tissue culture plates were coated with 30 ug/ml Retronectin (Takara Bio) overnight at 4uC one day prior to transduction. Wells were then washed with HBSS and blocked with PBS 2% BSA. Lymphocytes were harvested, washed, counted and 5 3 10 5 cells plated into retronectin coated wells and mixed with 1.5-2 ml of unconcentrated retroviral supernatants collected as described above. After 24 h, the viral supernatant was replaced with Aim-V medium with 2% human AB serum, supplemented with 100 U/ml IL-2. TCR surface expression was tested with HLA-pentamers (ProImmune), HLA-tetramer produced by peptide exchange 39 or anti-Vb antibodies 72 h post transduction. Functionality of TCR redirected T cells was tested 7 days post transduction as described below.
Flow cytometry analysis of TCR expression. Monitoring expression of the introduced TCR was dependent on available reagents. In most cases both anti-Vbeta antibodies (Beckman Coulter) and PE labeled HLA pentamers (ProImmune)/ tetramers (prepared in-house) were available. However, there was no TCR V beta antibody available for the HBV Env 370-79 TCR and no multimer available for the EBV EBNA-4NP 399-408 . Pentamer staining was performed for 15 minutes at room temperature in PBS, 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide (staining buffer). Cells were washed and stained with CD8-PeCy7 (BD Bioscience, RPA-T8) for 30 min on ice. In parallel, transduced T cells were stained with anti-V beta antibodies 1 CD8-PECy7 for 30 min on ice. Cells were immediately fixed with PBS 1 1% formaldehyde and analyzed on FACs Canto flow cytometer. To determine optimal TCR alpha/beta orientation we selected 2-3 retroviral clones carrying the TCRs in either the alpha-2A-beta or beta-2A-alpha orientation and used these retroviral clones to transduce T cells as described above. Each experiment was performed at least twice and the best clone from each orientation was used to test their functionality.
Redirected T cell functionality was tested 7 d post transduction. Either HLA-A0201 T2 cells or HLA-matched immortalized EBV B cell lines were used as antigen presenting cells (APCs) to test functionality of the TCR redirected T cells. APCs were loaded with 1 mg/ml for each peptide for 1 h at room temperature. APCs were washed with HBSS and co-cultured with TCR redirected T cells overnight in Aim-V 2% Abs with 2 mg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma). Cells were stained with CD8-PECy7 and fixed with cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences). Cells were then stained with anti-IFN-c-APC, TNF-a-Alexa488 (BD Biosciences) or IL-2-PE (R&D Systems) for 30 min on ice with staining buffer 1 0.1% saponin (Sigma). Cytokine producing cells were analyzed on a BD FACs Canto flow cytometer.
Initial experiments comparing HLA pentamer staining to IFN-c producing T cells were performed on separate days (day 3 or 7). We also measured IFN-c production vs HLA pentamer or V beta antibody in the same experiment. At 4 d post transduction, either mock transduced or redirected T cells were stained with HLA pentamers or anti-V beta antibodies and then activated by peptide loaded APCs for 5 h in Aim-V, 2% AB serum 1 10 mg/ml brefeldin A. Following 5 h incubation, cells were labeled with a Fixable Viability Dye eFluor780 (eBioscience) and stained with CD8-PECy7 and CD4-Alexa700. Cells were fixed and stained for IFN-c-APC as above. IFN-c production was monitored in CD8 V beta or pentamer positive cells.
To confirm cytotoxic function, redirected cells specific for the HBV core18-27 epitope were sorted based on TCR V beta and CD8 expression. Sorted Vbeta1CD81 T cells were co-cultured overnight in 96 well flat-bottom plates with 20,000 HepG2 cells expressing luciferase plus either the HBV core antigen or an irrelevant antigen, HBV surface antigen, at 155 and 1510 effector5target ratios. Following the incubation, media was removed and cells were washed once with PBS. Steady-Glo reagent (Promega) was added to each well and incubated for 5 min at RT in dark to allow cell lysis. Steady-Glo reagent was transferred into a black 96-well plate and luminescence was measured using a Biotek Synergy 4 microplate reader. Results were expressed as % lysis 5 100% 2 (luminescence remaining after lysis (HepG2 1 T cells)/maximum luminescence (HepG2 alone))% and calculated as mean of triplicate measurements 1/2 standard deviation.
Toll-like receptor ligand activation. Healthy donor PBMC were activated as above for retroviral transduction with 50 ng/ml OKT-3 and 600 U/ml IL-2. In addition to the standard condition, TLR agonists 10 mg/ml polyI:C (TLR-3), 5 mg/ml Imiquimod (TLR-7), 1 mg/ml ssRNA40 (TLR-8), and 5 uM CpG (CpG2216; TLR-9) (Invivogen) were added during the first 48 h of PBMC activation. Following the 48 h incubation, the media was removed for transduction and stored at 280 C for luminex analysis. TLR ligands were not maintained in the maintenance medium and T cells were transduced with the HBV core 18-27-specific TCR and cultured in Aim-V 1 2% human AB serum 1 100 U/ml IL-2. TCR expression was monitored using HLA-A2-HBc18-27 pentamers and the functionality was monitored intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-c. Supernatants taken from 48 h activated cultures were analyzed for cytokine production using the MILLIPLEX Cytokine/Chemokine 42-Premixed Panel (Milipore). Luminex analysis was performed by the Immune Monitoring Core at the Singapore Immunology network.",Building and Optimizing a Virus-specific T Cell Receptor Library for Targeted Immunotherapy in Viral Infections,"Banu, Nasirah; Chia, Adeline; Ho, Zi Zong; Garcia, Alfonso Tan; Paravasivam, Komathi; Grotenbreg, Gijsbert M.; Bertoletti, Antonio; Gehring, Adam J.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3933865/,150,5055,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,29445ecd280247f79d6cebe0c3b4d06796e72eb9,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has emerged in several pig-raising countries and has been a causative pathogen associated with diarrheal diseases in South Korea since 2014. In the present study, we were able to isolate and cultivate a Korean PDCoV strain (KNU16-07) in cell culture and investigate its pathogenicity. PDCoV-inoculated piglets showed watery diarrhea accompanied by acute enteritis in the natural host. Sequencing analysis demonstrated the genetic stability of KNU16-07 for at least thirty serial passages.","Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerging enterotropic swine coronavirus that causes acute enteritis in nursing piglets [7, 10] . PDCoV was first identified in Hong Kong, China in 2012 and, subsequently, has emerged in most major swine-producing nations in Asia and North America [11, 13, 14] . The presence of PDCoV in South Korea was first announced in early 2014 [7] . Our previous report indicated that monoinfection by PDCoV and coinfection by PDCoV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are common in pig herds in South Korea [4] .
In addition to studies on molecular surveillance and sequence analysis of PDCoV, more advanced PDCoV research is required for virus characterization in vitro and in vivo and to develop effective vaccines for PDCoV prevention. To accomplish these goals, obtaining a Korean PDCoV isolate that can grow efficiently in cell culture is essential. There have been no reports on the cultivation of a Korean PDCoV strain, although several research groups from the USA and China have reported the successful propagation of PDCoV strains in cell culture [1] [2] [3] . Therefore, the present study aimed to isolate PDCoV from PDCoV-positive fecal samples and assess the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes and genetic characteristics of the PDCoV isolate KNU16-07.
Swine testicle (ST) cells (ATCC CRL-1746; ATCC, USA) were cultured in alpha minimum essential medium (-MEM; Invitrogen, USA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotic-antimycotic solutions (100×; Invitrogen). Small intestinal homogenates and stool specimens that tested PDCoV-positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [4] were selected for virus isolation experiments. PDCoV isolation was attempted on ST cells as described previously [3] , but with the modification of adding trypsin (USB, USA) to the virus growth medium to obtain a final concentration of 5 to 10 g/mL. The virus supernatants were purified and examined by using a transmission electron microscope (HT7700; Hitachi High Technologies, Japan) as described previously [9] .
The PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) antigen was prepared from PK-PDCoV-N cells stably expressing the PDCoV N protein as described previously [8] . The cell lysate supernatant containing recombinant N protein was purified by using a HiTrap TALON crude column (GE Healthcare, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified protein was concentrated with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters 10K (Millipore, USA) and the final product was used as the antigen. PDCoV N-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced by immunizing 4-week-old male BALB/c mice as described previously [12] .
The pig infection experiments described herein were performed at the KNU Animal Facility and followed guidelines established by its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC No. KNU-2016-2032) as described previously [6, 11] . A total of four newborn piglets at 4 days of age were obtained from a commercial pig farm with no known prior PDCoV/PEDV outbreak or PEDV vaccination. All animals were determined to be free of PEDV as well as free of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and rotavirus. Pigs were randomly assigned to two experimental groups housed in two separated rooms: PDCoV-inoculated group (n = 3) in room 1 and sham-inoculated control group (n = 1) in room 2. Following a 1-day acclimation period, piglets in the challenge group were orally administered 1 mL of 10 5 TCID 50 /mL (TCID 50 , 50% tissue culture infective dose) of KNU16-07-P10 virus. The sham-inoculated pig was administered cell culture media as a placebo.
The complete genomic sequences of the KNU16-07 isolates at passage 5 (P5) and passage 10 (P10) were determined by performing rapid amplification of the cDNA ends and by using the traditional Sanger method as described previously [6, 7] . The whole genomic nucleotide sequences of KNU16-07-P5 and KNU16-07-P10 were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MG837130 and MG837131, respectively. The entire structural gene sequences of the isolate at passages 20 and 30 (KNU16-07-P20 and KNU16-07-P30) were also determined by the Sanger method, as described above, and deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers MG837132 and MG837133, respectively. The PDCoV isolate designated as KNU16-07 was isolated from the feces of a naturally infected piglet from a commercial farm located in Kyungpook Province. KNU16-07 virus produced distinct cytopathic effects (CPE) typical of a PDCoV infection, such as cell rounding, clumping together in clusters, and detachment in infected ST cells at passage 2. In later passages, visible CPE appeared at 12 h post-infection (hpi) and became pronounced by 24 hpi. Virus propagation was confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay using commercial (SD55-197; Medgene Labs, USA) and homemade (KDN4-1) PDCoV N-specific MAbs as described previously [6] . In contrast, no CPE or N-specific staining were evident in mock-inoculated cells (panel A in Fig. 1 ). Ultrastructural analysis of purified virus suspensions revealed multiple virus particles approximately 150 to 200 nm in diameter with typical spike-like surface projections that were morphologically indistinguishable from those of coronaviruses (panel B in Fig.  1) . The viral genome levels in selected passages were examined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR as described previously [6, 11] . The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value was determined to be 15.0, ranging from 13.9 (P10) to 16.1 (P5). The infectious titer of the isolate ranged from 10 7.8 to 10 8.8 TCID50/mL up to P5; this value was stably maintained in later passages. The peak viral titer reached 10 7.8 TCID 50 /mL or more beginning at P5 (panel C in Fig. 1) . Analysis of growth kinetics demonstrated that KNU16-07 replicated rapidly and efficiently in ST cells, reaching a titer ＞ 10 6 TCID 50 /mL by 12 hpi (panel D in Fig. 1) .
The PDCoV-challenged piglets exhibited clinical signs including diarrheic feces and lethargy by 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) and then displayed vomiting and diarrhea for 3 days. All inoculated animals were positive for PDCoV, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, at 1 or 2 dpi, and they shed PDCoV in feces. Peak mean Ct values of 16.8 (range, 16.7-16.8) and 18.7 (range, 18.5-18.9) were obtained at 3 to 4 dpi. The negative control pig remained active with normal feces and no fecal shedding of PDCoV detected throughout the study period. Two animals were independently euthanatized at 3 and 5 dpi for postmortem assessments, whereas the remaining piglets were necropsied at 35 dpi. Unlike the negative control piglet, all challenged piglets exhibited typical PDCoV-like macroscopic observations with thin and transparent small intestine walls (panel A in Fig. 2) . The inoculated pigs also developed histopathological intestinal lesions associated with viral enteritis, including shortened and fused villi in the small intestine (panels B and C in Fig. 2) . Furthermore, an immunohistochemistry assay detected PDCoV in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes throughout the small intestines (panel D in Fig. 2) . These macroscopic and microscopic observations are consistent with previous studies using USA PDCoV isolates [1, 5] . Taken together, the results show that experimental infection of newborn piglets with PDCoV KNU16-07 induces clinical disease signs corresponding to acute enteritis, indicating enteropathogenicity of the isolate in the natural host. Additionally, all inoculated pigs had detectable PDCoV-specific neutralizing antibody (NA) by 14 dpi and maintained high NA titers of 1:128 to 1:256 thereafter, demonstrating the ability of KNU16-07 to induce efficient immune responses.
The entire genomes of the cell culture-adapted KNU16-07-P5 and -P10 strains were 25,422 nucleotides long and displayed genomic organization identical to all previously sequenced PDCoVs. The full-length genomic sequences of the original fecal sample (KNU16-07-feces, GenBank accession No. KY364365) and cell-passaged viruses were comparatively analyzed; the data are summarized in Table 1 . Compared to KNU16-07-feces, KNU16-07-P5 and -P10 identically showed five nucleotide differences at positions 7737, 8218, 16481, 19808, and 21875. All mutations were non-synonymous, causing two, one, and two amino acid changes in the ORF1a, ORF1ab, and S coding regions, respectively. The two amino acid substitutions at positions 162 (Thr to Asn) and 851 (Asn to Ser) in the S coding region were sustained through passage 30 (KNU16-07-P30). No cell culture-adapting mutations arose in the E, M, and N protein-coding regions. These results reveal that the PDCoV isolate KNU16-07 is genetically stable during cell passages. This is the first report describing the isolation, serial passages, in vitro and in vivo phenotypic features, and genotypic traits of a Korean PDCoV strain. The availability of this Korean isolate will enable cutting-edge research to investigate the molecular virology as well as to develop potential vaccines against emergent PDCoVs.

A literature search covering pathogenesis, clinical features and therapeutics, clinically developed drugs for repurposing and novel drug targets was performed. This review presents current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical features of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The rationale for and outcomes with treatments used for SARS and MERS is discussed. The main focus of the review is on drug development and the potential that drugs approved for other indications provide for repurposing. The drugs we discuss belong to a wide range of different drug classes, such as cancer therapeutics, antipsychotics, and antimalarials. In addition to their activity against MERS and SARS coronaviruses, many of these approved drugs have broad-spectrum potential and have already been in clinical use for treating other viral infections. A wealth of knowledge is available for these drugs. However, the information in this review is not meant to guide clinical decisions, and any therapeutic described here should only be used in context of a clinical trial.

83,e484923f000ae4706e2213031654865cef348def,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance, has caused severe acute respiratory disease in more than 1600 people, resulting in almost 600 deaths. The high case fatality rate, growing geographic distribution and vaguely defined epidemiology of this novel pathogen have created an urgent need for effective public health countermeasures, including safe and effective treatment strategies. Despite the relatively few numbers of cases to date, research and development of MERS-CoV therapeutic candidates is advancing quickly. This review surveys the landscape of these efforts and assesses their potential for use in affected populations.","Respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of mortality in resource-limited settings, accounting for more than 4 million deaths each year globally [1] . Epidemic-and pandemic-prone respiratory viruses are the aetiological pathogens in many cases, and have caused several of the most prominent infectious disease outbreaks of the past two decades: these include H5N1 influenza in 1997, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009. Most recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a novel cause of severe acute respiratory illness after first being identified in a Saudi Arabian patient in 2012 [2] . Although initially restricted to the Arabian Peninsula, this emerging pathogen has respectively infected and killed more than 1600 and 580 people on four continents across 26 countries [3, 4] . Phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV [5] , MERS-CoV has a similar clinical presentation [6] [7] [8] [9] , albeit with a higher case fatality rate (~40% versus 10%) [3] [4] [5] . Dromedary camels serve as the principal animal reservoir for this virus; and zoonotic spillover from dromedaries to humans has, thus far, driven the course of the epidemic [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Although humanto-human transmission has been documented -particularly in the context of nosocomial outbreaks [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] -the spread of MERS-CoV is inefficient and unsustained, as reflected in an estimated reproduction rate of no higher than 0.7 [25, 26] . MERS-CoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that comprises a 30-kilobase genome that codes for four structural proteins and an RNA polymerase [27] , typical of the Coronaviridae family ( Figure 1 ). The most immunogenic of these proteins is the virus' only surface glycoprotein, Spike (S) [28] [29] [30] that mediates viral attachment and fusion via the host cognate receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [31] . Although the broad principles of the virus' life cycle and its mechanisms of pathogenesis are beginning to be understood, this knowledge has not yet translated to a licensed therapy or vaccine. Much of the work to develop safe and effective MERS-CoV countermeasures has centred on vaccines, but the relatively low prevalence of the disease, the sporadic nature of the case clusters and the dearth of detailed knowledge on chains of transmission highlight the need for greater investments into the discovery of effective therapeutic and secondary prophylactic regimens for infected and exposed individuals.
Efforts to research and develop treatment strategies for MERS-CoV are accelerating but remain limited in their scope and stage of advancement. There are few novel compounds being studied that are specific for MERS-CoV molecular targets, as most treatment options, investigational and licensed, are being repurposed from their use for other RNA viruses or other non-infectious diseases. The current landscape of MERS-CoV therapies, therefore, is dominated by an armamentarium of repositioned drugs with in vitro activity against MERS-CoV replication, but is also speckled with agents that are directed towards and derived from host immunity. The current review surveys the landscape of therapeutic products in each category and assesses their potential for advanced testing and development. respiratory and circulatory support, preservation of renal, hepatic and neurological function, and prevention of secondary infections. Beyond implementing basic principles of critical care medicine, immune-based therapies have been used most commonly during both the SARS-CoV pandemic of 2003 and the current MERS-CoV epidemic, each time yielding equivocal results. There have been some promising animal data where combination treatment with ribavirin and interferon (IFN)-α2b improved clinical outcomes in MERS-CoV-infected non-human primates (NHPs). However, treatment was initiated very soon after viral challenge (~8 hours), a window that is unlikely to be replicated in a real-world clinical setting [32] .
Various IFN regimens, in combination with ribavirin, have been intermittently administered to severely ill patients, although typically in an ad hoc manner and in the absence of systematic evaluation [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Individual case reports and uncontrolled case series not only limit determination of whether an intervention works but if it is safe as well. Ribavirin, for example, is a potent nucleoside analogue that has been used with varying measures of success against a range of RNA viruses [38] . However, patients can experience significant toxicities when given the drug alone or in combination with an interferon, including but not limited to haemolytic anaemia and metabolic abnormalities. Interferons also can elicit systemic adverse effects, psychiatric disturbances and neutropenia [39] . Thus, without the benefit of randomised controlled trial data, it becomes difficult to assess whether the treatment is worse than the disease. Certain strategies, however, have been shown to worsen clinical outcomes in the setting of a coronavirus infection. For example, studies during the SARS pandemic showed that corticosteroids, when used early on SARS-CoV infected patients, significantly increased viral load, ICU admission and mortality [40, 41] . The role for interferon therapies has been less clear in the current MERS-CoV epidemic, as some data show a positive impact on proximate outcomes, such as oxygenation and inflammation, but no effect on more significant outcomes like hospital stay and long-term survival [35, 36, 42] .
Rapidly scaled treatments based on naturally occurring neutralising antibodies such as convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin, on the other hand, have been shown to be relatively safe and potentially effective for reducing mortality from several infections such as SARS-CoV and influenza [43] [44] [45] , and may hold promise for MERS-CoV as well. This strategy, however, relies on the rapid identification of cases and contacts and immediate deployment of products to have maximal impact. One study found that convalescent plasma decreased mortality in SARS-CoV patients only if administered within 14 days of illness [44] . A network for the use of convalescent plasma for case clusters of MERS-CoV is currently being assembled [43] to test its safety, efficacy and feasibility. However, actualisation of this plan is limited by logistical challenges, local technical capacity and donor supply. Unfortunately, no host-derived experimental interventions have yet demonstrated appreciable benefit in acutely ill, MERS-CoVinfected patients in a consistent or controlled manner. This reality, although, has not slowed down the discovery and advancement of passive prophylactic products derived from vaccinated and infected animals and humans.
Despite intensive efforts to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine, the prevalence and transmissibility of this emerging pathogen are both relatively low [3, 26] , making it difficult to define a target population for vaccination. mAbs, on the other hand, can be administered in the setting of an outbreak without the need to discriminate who might be at greatest risk for infection. They can be used to treat cases early in their natural history and for post-exposure prophylaxis of case contacts. mAbs also carry the benefits of higher potency, greater specificity, more extensive pre-licensing evaluation and consequently a more vetted safety profile. Additionally, mAbs can help define immunogenic epitopes through crystallographic analysis, thereby providing atomic-level detail for the design of better immunogens. They also have been proven as effective therapies in the areas of cancer treatment and autoimmune disease management.
Although there is only one pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus, for which a mAb is licensed for use, there are a number of other infectious disease indications-such as Ebola virus disease treatment and human immunodeficiency virus primary and secondary prevention-for which mAbs are being tested in advanced phase clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Despite all of these advantages, the timelines and costs of mAb research and development (R&D) are respectively longer and higher than that for polyclonal antibody preparations.
In spite of the requirements for greater upfront investments and a more rigorous testing and approval process, several groups have identified highly potent MERS-CoV mAbs and are advancing them through preclinical stages of development (Table 1) . Some have been isolated from immunised animals (mice/humanised mice/NHPs) [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] , while others have been identified from either an antibody human phage library [55] or memory B cells of infected and recovered human survivors [56] . Almost all of the published mAbs and all of those in development target the S receptor-binding domain (RBD), which contains the most immunogenic epitopes on the virus. Many bind to the RBD, expressed both on a recombinant S and on the surface of live virus, with picomolar affinity and neutralise MERS-CoV at a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 10 ng/μL or less. Additionally, several groups have demonstrated New York Blood Center Mersmab1 S1 imunised mouse RBD In vitro [46] NIH National Cancer Institute M336, m337, m338 Human antibody library RBD In vitro [52] NIH NIAID D12, F11, G2, G4 S/S1 immunised mouse RBD, S1, S2 NHP efficacy [51] Regeneron REGN3048/REGN3051 Humanised mouse RBD Mouse/NHP efficacy [49] Tsinghua University MERS-4, MERS-27 Human antibody library RBD In vitro [47] RBD: receptor binding domain; S: Spike glycoprotein; S1: Spike domain containing RBD; S2: Spike domain containing fusion machinery.
Journal of Virus Eradication 2016; 2: 1-4 protective efficacy in pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis animal models. Because most of the antibodies target the RBD, there is a potential for viral escape from any one mAb. Thus, there may be a need to develop antibodies against other vulnerable sites on S or to investigate the use of combination mAbs to overcome the potential emergence of therapeutic resistance. It is likely that mAbs directed at other sites on the S glycoprotein have already been recovered but are not as potent neutralisers, as is the case in one report [51] . A more efficient search for potent neutralising antibodies that target epitopes outside the RBD could be facilitated by a more detailed understanding of the atomic-level structure of the entire S glycoprotein, as has already been resolved for the RBD. The successes thus far in isolating potent and protective mAbs, although significant, are likely to be tempered by the challenges of advancing these products to licensing and full-scale production at affordable costs for as of yet undefined populations in a relatively short timeframe. Thus, mAbs should be advanced along a development pipeline in parallel with a program of rational drug design and discovery.
Although intensive, supportive care still serves as the primary treatment option for MERS-CoV and mAbs are the focus of the most advanced R&D efforts, antiviral therapies are being actively investigated for use in severely ill patients. There are two main pathways for drug discovery: de novo development and repurposing licensed medications. There are few new antivirals for MERS-CoV; however, the Ebola epidemic has had an unanticipated consequence of facilitating their development. One in particular, GS-5734 developed by Gilead Sciences, is an adenine analogue that is incorporated into viral RNA to disrupt replication [57] . It has shown survival benefit in NHPs inoculated with Ebola virus and is now advancing through a Phase I dose escalation trial. It has been claimed to have in vitro activity against MERS-CoV as well, but publication of these data is pending. Similarly, BCX4430 is a nucleoside analogue that is being developed by Biocryst Pharmaceuticals for potential treatment of filoviruses, coronaviruses and other RNA viruses [58] . Additionally, small interfering RNA molecules and peptide inhibitors are being investigated for their ability to disrupt MERS-CoV replication, although these products are still in very early phases of investigation [59, 60] .
As the life cycle and genetic sequence of this new coronavirus has become better elucidated, the rational design and development of novel and approved agents with potent antiviral activity have become possible. The advent of high-throughput screens of licensed compounds and small molecules has also allowed researchers to efficiently evaluate large libraries of drugs for their in vitro antiviral activity against novel targets [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . To date, several dozen licensed drugs have been reported to inhibit MERS-CoV replication. Using slightly different screening technologies, different groups have converged on some common classes of compounds, including nucleoside analogues, antibacterial protein synthesis inhibitors, kinase signalling modifiers, antimetabolites and antiprotozoal agents.
Mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of both T an B lymphocytes, has also been found to have strong activity against MERS-CoV, as it does against other RNA viruses such as West Nile, hepatitis C and dengue [63] . Only one of the drugs to show in vitro activity against MERS-CoV, lopinavir, however, has been tested in an animal model. MERS-CoV-challenged marmosets that were treated with this protease inhibitor had better clinical, pathological, virological and radiological outcomes than controls or those treated with mycophenolate mofetil [67] . Additionally, two peptides, HR1P and HR2P are being developed as potential fusion inhibitors [59] . By acting on the six-helix bundle core of the MERS-CoV S protein to prevent protein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, this class of compounds may hold potential beyond MERS-CoV towards a long-term objective of a pan-coronavirus antiviral. Given some of the common life cycles and pathways of pathogenesis for RNA viruses and homologies in protein structures across different coronaviruses, there may be economies of effort and investment in developing antivirals that have activity against more than one virus or family of viruses. Irrespective of the breadth of these novel or repurposed compounds, treatment studies should be carried out prospectively according to protocols that plan for the collection of quality controlled data and serial biological sampling to assess viral evolution and biomarkers of favourable clinical outcomes.
Recent infectious disease outbreaks such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the H7N9 influenza epidemic in China, the Ebola crisis in West Africa and now the MERS-CoV outbreak have highlighted the need for better R&D preparedness and improved coordination of clinical testing in the face of the accelerating number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The ability to have an armamentarium of countermeasures and clinical trial infrastructure in the early phases of an outbreak is critical for mounting an effective public health campaign. For example, the SARS-CoV pandemic caused more than 8000 cases of severe acute respiratory illness and nearly 900 deaths but few prospective, controlled studies were undertaken to determine the optimal management of the disease. Consequently, treatment options for SARS-CoV were never defined clearly and thus difficult to adapt for MERS-CoV. Although global coordination has resulted in the advancement of some urgently needed, novel countermeasures for MERS-CoV, they will have to be developed along faster timelines than before, with greater investments earlier in the preclinical development pipeline that can generate products for more timely efficacy testing in affected populations. As the global community takes lessons from the most recent outbreak and prepares for the potential of another regional epidemic or broader pandemic, stakeholders in MERS-CoV R&D must set out a sound strategy now for where to best target their investments in anticipation of the changing dynamics of the current and future outbreaks.",Treatment strategies for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Modjarrad, Kayvon",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4745090/,98,2431,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,b7aee99640edf75791f77fd9ab46534c27efdaae,"Background. Registration of interventional trials of Food and Drug Administration-regulated drug and biological products and devices became a legal requirement in 2007; the vast majority of these trials are registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. An analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov offers an opportunity to define the clinical research landscape; here we analyze 10 years of infectious disease (ID) clinical trial research.
Methods. Beginning with 166 415 interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007-2017, ID trials were selected by study conditions and interventions. Relevance to ID was confirmed through manual review, resulting in 13 707 ID trials and 152 708 non-ID trials.
Results. ID-related trials represented 6.9%-9.9% of all trials with no significant trend over time. ID trials tended to be more focused on treatment and prevention, with a focus on testing drugs, biologics, and vaccines. ID trials tended to be large, randomized, and nonblinded with a greater degree of international enrollment. Industry was the primary funding source for 45.2% of ID trials. Compared with the global burden of disease, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS and hepatitis C trials were overrepresented, and lower respiratory tract infection trials were underrepresented. Hepatitis C trials fluctuated, keeping with a wave of new drug development. Influenza vaccine trials peaked during the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza outbreak.
Conclusions. This study presents the most comprehensive characterization of ID clinical trials over the past decade. These results help define how clinical research aligns with clinical need. Temporal trends reflect changes in disease epidemiology and the impact of scientific discovery and market forces. Periodic review of ID clinical trials can help identify gaps and serve as a mechanism to realign resources.","The appropriate management of infectious diseases (IDs) requires an understanding of the risk and efficacy of medical drugs, biologics, and devices. In this context of evidence-based medicine, clinical trials contribute knowledge to replace or confirm prior dogma. As discussed elsewhere, ID specialists often contend with a lack of clinical trials (and particularly randomized controlled trials) to inform clinical decision making [1, 2] .
ClinicalTrials.gov is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)managed database of >265 000 clinical trials from 203 nations. Registration with ClinicalTrials.gov has been a legal requirement for most interventional trials of FDA-regulated drug and biological products and devices conducted in the United States since September 2007, in addition to being a requirement for publication in many peer-reviewed medical journals [3, 4] . In 2010, an initiative of the Clinical Trials Transformation Institute began to describe the trials represented in the ClinicalTrials.gov database from 2007 to 2010 [5] ID trials in the database were previously described as part of this 3-year ""snapshot. "" [1] Trials focusing on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C, respiratory tract infections, and pediatric antibiotic and antifungal trials were subsequently reported [6] [7] [8] .
In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to characterize the scope and nature of ID clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov for a 10-year period through a systematic analysis of registered trials. As with the 2007-2010 snapshot, we examined trial methods and funding source, with a new emphasis on analyzing trends over time. We also evaluated the alignment between current clinical research priorities and the disease burden of IDs in the United States and abroad. In addition, we provided a more detailed analysis of hepatitis C trials given the significant changes in hepatitis C management over the past decade. METHODS We performed a systematic analysis of characteristics of ID trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2017. We chose ClinicalTrials.gov for our analysis because it was used for the 2007-2010 snapshot and, as described elsewhere, it is among the largest trial repositories, has comprehensive data fields, and has established methods for data download [1] . Although ClinicalTrials.gov is not the most comprehensive database of clinical trials (compared with the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), it is an accurate reflection of clinical trials being conducted in IDs and is amenable to aggregate analysis [1] . Moreover, a comprehensive review of ID trials has not been completed since the initial snapshot, although reviews have been published of respiratory tract infection trials, HIV and hepatitis C trials, and pediatric antibacterial and antifungal trials [6] [7] [8] . The 10 years of clinical trials examined in this study include trials submitted to comply with requirements for publication in peer-reviewed medical journals and trials registered under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 and other regulatory requirements [9] .
The ID study data set was created as described elsewhere [1] . We used the 16 October 2017 version of the database for Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov to identify clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov from 1 October 2007 through 30 September 2017. This cohort represents the entirety of clinical trials registered after US legal requirements for registering certain interventional trials available at the time of this study [9] . Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov is a relational database (PostgreSQL) developed and maintained by the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative. It contains all information about studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov since its inception in February 2000 and is updated daily with content downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov. The database is publicly available in the cloud, with access information and documentation provided at the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative website [10] . We then focused on interventional trials by filtering the data set using the registry's ""study type"" field, which identifies studies as interventional, observational, expanded access, or not applicable.
To identify ID trials, we focused on the condition and intervention characteristics, which were defined by submitted data and linked Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms generated by a National Library of Medicine (NLM) algorithm based on the 2017 MeSH thesaurus [11] . Of 10 466 MeSH terms manually reviewed, 991 (9.5%) were related to IDs. Because some conditions could not be linked to MeSH terms, free-text condition terms appearing in ≥5 interventional trials were also manually reviewed for relevance. Of 5140 possible free-text condition terms reviewed, 345 were relevant to IDs (6.7%) (Supplementary Table 1) .
ID trials were also identified using the submitted intervention term. Intervention terms linked to MeSH terms generated by the NLM algorithm that appeared in ≥4 clinical trials were reviewed for relevance. Of the 2101 intervention MeSH terms reviewed, 309 were identified as relevant to IDs (14.7%). An initial data set of 19 794 trials was generated by identifying trials with ≥1 relevant term in the NLM-generated MeSH condition field, the submitted free-text condition field, or the submitted intervention name field. This process was previously developed and validated by comparison with classifications based on manual review, for studies of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mental health [12] . Trials were then manually reviewed by one of us (I. S. J.) to exclude non-ID studies. A total of 13 707 ID studies were identified, which defines the study data set used for this analysis.
After defining the ID trials data set, we subcategorized trials by IDs based on study title and description. Subcategories were defined based on World Health Organization (WHO) causeof-death groupings, excluding ""maternal conditions"" and ""perinatal conditions"" [1] . Along with the 18 WHO categories, 42 additional categories were defined (for a total of 60), such that each trial was assigned to ≥1 subcategory. Trials that fit equally well into multiple subcategories were assigned to multiple categories. Trials were also manually categorized as vaccine trials or nonvaccine trials. The percentage of all ID-related deaths and ID-related disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to selected conditions was calculated from the 2000-2015 WHO Global Burden of Disease [13, 14] .
We used R software, version 3.4 (Foundation for Statistical Computing) to calculate frequencies and percentages for categorical trial characteristics and median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous characteristics. Disease prevalence and disease-specific DALYs were derived from the 2015 WHO global health estimates summary tables [13] . Actual enrollment or anticipated enrollment was reported and summary statistics were calculated by pooling across active and completed trials. Probable funding source (because ClinicalTrials.gov does not require funding source be reported) was attributed based on the lead sponsor and collaborator fields and reported as ""industry, "" ""NIH"" [National Institutes of Health], ""U.S. federal (excluding NIH), "" or ""Other. "" A trial was considered ""industry-funded"" if the lead sponsor was from industry, or if the NIH was neither a lead sponsor nor collaborator and ≥1 collaborator was from industry. An ""NIH-funded"" study required the NIH to be either a lead sponsor or a collaborator, and no industry as lead sponsor. ""Other"" was used to describe studies for which the lead sponsor and collaborator fields were nonmissing and did not meet criteria for either industry or NIH funding. Countries were grouped into 11 global regions to allow analysis of geographical regions.
The initial data set downloaded on 16 October 2017 included 256 544 clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.
A total of 166 415 interventional trials were registered from 1 October 2007, after enactment of mandatory registration on 27 September 2007, through 30 September 2017, providing a 10-year period for studying trends in registered trials. Of these, 13 707 trials (8.5%) were defined as the ID trial data set.
A summary of ID trials, non-ID trials, and selected subcategories (HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, malaria, skin and softtissue infection, and lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]) is presented in Table 1 [15] . These categories were chosen for further analysis based on their prevalence as well as global and domestic significance. The primary purpose was ""treatment"" in the majority of both ID (52.7%) and non-ID trials (69.6%). A higher proportion of ID trials than non-ID trials focused on prevention (32.5% vs 9.1%, respectively). In terms of intervention type, ID trials also tended to be more drug focused than non-ID trials (54.4% vs 50.3%, respectively) and more biologic/ vaccine focused (23.5% vs 5.0%). Of 3215 ID trials with a biologic or vaccine intervention, 85.3% evaluated a vaccine. ID trials were less likely than non-ID trials to concern interventions involving procedures (4.2% vs 10.7%, respectively) or devices (5.9% vs 14.2%).
ID trials also tended to be larger than non-ID trials, with a median (interquartile range) enrollment of 102 (37-321.5) versus 60 (27-145) subjects for non-ID studies. The largest studies were observed for Enterovirus trials (mean enrollment, 6855 subjects; median, 780), trachoma (mean, 5035; median 1139), intestinal nematode infection (mean, 4323; median, 172), and malaria (mean, 3652; median, 141). These results were due primarily to the inclusion of multiple large (>10 000-subject) studies, including 5 Enterovirus, 1 trachoma, 2 intestinal nematode infection, and 28 malaria trials. Five trials included ≥100 000 subjects, 1 for intestinal nematode infection trial and 4 for malaria. However, only the Enterovirus and trachoma categories had median enrollments of >500 subjects.
A greater percentage of ID trials focused specifically on children (≤18 years of age (13.3%), compared with non-ID trials (6.3%). Moreover, ID trials were more likely than non-ID trials to exclude elderly patients (>65 years of age) (32.8% vs 2.9%, respectively). After omission of trials restricted to pediatric subjects, ID trials were still more likely than non-ID trials to exclude elderly patients (21.3% vs 17.8%, respectively). Omitting trials restricted to pediatrics, we observed that certain trial categories excluded elderly patients at higher rates: pharmacology (54.5%), HIV/AIDS (31.4%), influenza vaccine (29.8%), malaria (28.6%), and tuberculosis (21.7%) trials were more likely to exclude the elderly. In line with non-ID trials, the majority of ID trials were randomized (85.9%) and did not use masking protocols (57.1%). ID trials were less likely than non-ID trials to occur in North America (37.8% vs 44.9%) or Europe (24.5% vs 29.2%).
Of the 13 707 ID trials, 11 881 (86.7%) were assigned to 1 clinical subcategory, 1754 (12.8%) were assigned to 2, and 72 (0.5%) were assigned to ≥3 . The distribution of trials across the 60 ID subcategories is presented in Figure 1 . The 4 most common trial categories (HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, influenza vaccine, and LRTI) accounted for 35.6% of all ID trials, in terms of trials assigned solely to those categories (4875 trials; Figure 1 ). Figure 1 also shows the total number of subjects enrolled or expected to be enrolled in each ID subcategory. HIV/AIDS had the highest numbers of trials and enrolled subjects. Despite having fewer trials, malaria and tuberculosis had the second and fourth highest numbers of enrolled subjects, owing to relatively large enrollment sizes.
Based on their frequency in the database and their global impact, 10 subcategories were chosen for more detailed characterization. The representation of these selected subcategories within the ClinicalTrials.gov ID data set was compared with global and United States ID-related deaths and DALYs (as defined by the WHO Global Burden of Disease) and is shown in Figure 2 . Hepatitis C trials accounted for 8.7% of ID trials registered from 2007-2017. This was similar to the hepatitis C virus-associated morbidity rate in the United States (6.3%) but higher than the global hepatitis C virus-associated morbidity rate (0.7%). Similarly, trials of HIV/ AIDS, hepatitis B, and sexually transmitted disease excluding HIV were overrepresented compared with both global and US burden of disease, whereas LRTI trials were underrepresented. Notably, diarrheal disease and tuberculosis trials were underrepresented compared with the global burden of disease (4.1% vs 16.7%, and 3.5% vs 11.0%, respectively). Hepatitis C trials were selected for additional scrutiny owing to the considerable advancements in hepatitis C treatment over the 10-year study period [16] . Hepatitis C trials tended to be more focused on treatment (89.0%) and specifically drug intervention (89.1%) than the rest of the ID trials (54.5%). They were also more likely to be funded by industry (72.0% vs 40.5%). Hepatitis C trials registered by year were pooled by phase as follows: early phase 1 trials were considered to be phase 1, phase 1/phase 2 trials were considered phase 2, and phase 2/ phase 3 trials were considered phase 3. The distribution of the phases of hepatitis C trials is presented in Figure 4 , along with key dates for these drugs, including date of first registration in ClinicalTrials.gov and date of FDA approval [17] [18] [19] [20] . As these new hepatitis C drugs entered into clinical testing, there is a phase shift evident in the trial phase, which begins with a predominance of phase 1, then advancing through the subsequent phases over time. Funding sources for hepatitis C trials per year are shown in Figure 4B . In general, industry funding plateaued in study years 2011 and 2012, with industry being the primary funding source for >80% of trials and dropping to 52.9% of studies by 2011. NIH funding fluctuated, but the NIH was the main funder for <10% of hepatitis C trials for all study years.
The ClinicalTrials.gov registry serves as one of the largest repositories of clinical trials. Although originally intended to be a portal that links clinical trials to the general public, it also serves as a useful tool to understand the clinical trial landscape. Several analyses of the registry have been published, focusing on overall trial characteristics, disease-specific characteristics, and compliance with results reporting. among other areas [5, 21, 22] . We previously used this database to characterize the landscape of ID trials, although that analysis was limited to the first 3 years (2007-2010) after registration of interventional trials became legally mandatory. Now that a decade of ClinicalTrials.gov data after FDA Amendments Act registration mandates are available, there is an opportunity to reanalyze the ID research landscape. Compared with our prior analysis of 2007-2010 trial data, many characteristics remained relatively unchanged [1] . This is largely because of qualities inherent to IDs. For example, there was a strong emphasis on prevention-focused trials. Similarly, the importance of vaccine-based interventions persisted. ID trials also restricted trials to children at a much higher rate than non-ID trials, potentially owing to the focus on prevention and vaccination within the field. This may be due to the greater burden of certain IDs in children. This predilection of IDs for the young partially, but not entirely, explains the higher rate of exclusion for elderly subjects. The exclusion of elderly subjects in the HIV/AIDS, influenza vaccine, tuberculosis, and malaria categories may limit the generalizability of some trials within these categories.
Despite registration requirements in ClinicalTrials.gov focusing on US-based and funded studies, ID trials tended to be more global, which highlights the global effects of IDs. ID trials also tended to be larger than non-ID trials. Certain disease categories, such as malaria, had much larger trials than other ID categories. Consequently, the number of trials in a category is not always a good proxy for the extent of work being done on a particular disease. Although some disease categories did have a higher median number of enrolled subjects per trial, total enrollment numbers for some categories were skewed by the presence of large trials (≥10 000) patients, which tended to be long-term postmarketing surveillance trials. Our analysis also found that, in the case of hepatitis C, drug and therapy development seems to follow anticipated patterns and funding sources. Hepatitis C presented a unique opportunity to observe the evolution of clinical trials research as new treatments became available. Predictably, trials progressed from earl-y to late-phase designs as new directly acting antiviral drugs moved through development and validation. Industry funding, the primary source of funding for these and most ID studies, tracked closely with the number of late-phase studies, indicating the large extent to which industry funding was the driving force behind hepatitis C research during this period. The new drug classes took 4-6 years to progress through the clinical research pipeline, with the first 2 years focused on earlyphase trials. It is worth noting that hepatitis C trials were found to be overrepresented in the ID trial data set compared with global morbidity and mortality rates. Considering that the parallel development of multiple drug interventions was occurring at essentially the same time, it is possible some of the overrepresentation of hepatitis C could have been averted through greater collaboration of industry, funding sources, and researchers. Platform trials, such as the Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response With Imaging And molecular Analysis 2 (I-SPY 2) model for breast cancer, could have been an ideal opportunity to streamline evaluation of these various new hepatitis C therapies [23] .
Although hepatitis C trials exhibited clear patterns, many other disease classes did not, including HIV/AIDS and malaria trials. Meanwhile, the number of LRTI trials increased toward the end of the study period, as did the number of trials focusing on sexually transmitted diseases excluding HIV, skin and soft-tissue infections, sepsis/catheter-related infections, hepatitis B, and diarrheal diseases (data not shown). Influenza vaccine trials exhibited a distinct spike in the number of clinical trials in study years 2008 and 2009, corresponding to the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic worldwide [24] . Hemorrhagic virus trials had a distinct spike in 2014-2015, corresponding to the 2014-2016 Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic in Western Africa [25] . Interestingly, the first Ebola case was reported in March 2014, just 6 months before the registration of several Ebola clinical trials. This is a relatively short time from the recognition of a need for clinical research, securing funding for that research, and initiation of the clinical trial [25] . A similar trend was observed with Zika trials, which also were registered only in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to the onset of that outbreak [26] . Despite extensive research on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus during 2007-2017, there were very few (n = 3) interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov pertaining to these infections. This is probably because the registry and our analysis focuses on interventional trials, whereas many studies of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus were observational and were therefore not required to register.
We found that the frequency of particular ID trial subcategories continued to poorly correlate with their global or US health impact. For example, hepatitis C trials were overrepresented compared with global and US mortality and disability rates. This should not imply that hepatitis C treatment is not clinically important. Rather, it highlights the discrepancy between the market forces that drive drug development and where clinical need may actually be greatest. Along these lines, LRTI trials continued to be underrepresented, constituting only 6.6% of the ID studies registered and 35.8% of infectionrelated global deaths. Malaria, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, childhood cluster diseases, and meningitis were also underrepresented compared with global ID morbidity and mortality rates, although these diseases were generally well represented or overrepresented compared with their very low prevalences in the United States.
The information presented herein may help identify how resources are being invested across the ID spectrum. Trial sponsors are generally focused on their respective studies and do not examine the entire portfolio of interventional ID research. A multiple-stakeholder approach to funding that incorporates the perspectives of industry, funding agencies, and policy makers may be better able to direct how resources are allocated and research areas prioritized such that public health needs are better matched to the market forces that drive much of the clinical trial enterprise.
The ID trials data set used for this analysis has several limitations. First, ClinicalTrials.gov was originally designed as a public repository for research trials and was not intended to support aggregate analysis for research purposes. As a result, trials may not be annotated by their sponsors in a consistent or complete manner. Second, the FDA requirement for registration applies to interventional trials of FDA-regulated drug and biologic products and devices. Although ""intervention"" encompasses a wide range of topics, a substantial amount of research, including clinical research, is noninterventional and therefore not captured in this data set [3, 27] . In addition, less common intervention types (eg, dietary and behavioral intervention) may not be captured. Third, ClinicalTrials.gov does not collect information about trial funding. We have attempted to present funding information using previously published algorithms. However, these algorithms make certain assumptions based on study sponsor, which limits some of the conclusions that can be made about funding. Fourth, ClinicalTrials.gov does not collect information regarding drug and therapeutic approvals, limiting our ability to draw conclusions on intervention development pipelines.
This examination of 10 years of ClinicalTrials.gov data revealed that ID trials are well represented in the overall clinical research landscape. They include a large global footprint, but the distribution of studies is not consistent with the US or global burden of disease. The registry also reflected real-world changes in drug discovery, research, and approval as seen for hepatitis C. Although these observations are necessarily retrospective, understanding the history of ID trials can also inform their future and provide an opportunity to examine the mechanisms through which research is prioritized.

Thus, it has become rather likely that one will find a homolog with known 3D structure when searching a sequence database with an arbitrary query sequence. Depending on the extent of similarity, such neighbor relationships may allow one to infer biological function and to identify functional sites such as binding motifs or catalytic centers. Entrez's 3D-structure database, the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), provides easy access to the richness of 3D structure data and its large potential for functional annotation. Entrez's search engine offers several tools to assist biologist users: (i) links between databases, such as between protein sequences and structures, (ii) precomputed sequence and structure neighbors, (iii) visualization of structure and sequence/structure alignment. Here, we describe an annotation service that combines some of these tools automatically, Entrez's 'Related Structure' links. For all proteins in Entrez, similar sequences with known 3D structure are detected by BLAST and alignments are recorded. The 'Related Structure' service summarizes this information and presents 3D views mapping sequence residues onto all 3D structures available in MMDB (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=structure).
CONTENT
The molecular modeling database (MMDB) is Entrez's 'Structure' database (1). Querying MMDB with text terms, e.g. one may identify structures of interest based on a protein name. Links between databases provide other search mechanisms. A query of Entrez PubMed database, e.g. will identify articles citing a particular protein name. Links from this set of articles to 'Structure' may identify structures not found by direct query, since PubMed abstracts contain additional descriptive terms. Currently, MMDB and its visualization services handle 25 000 user queries per day.","Experimental three-dimensional (3D) structure data are obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (2) . Authorannotated features provided by PDB are recorded in MMDB. The agreement between atomic coordinate and sequence data is verified, and sequence data are obtained from PDB coordinate records, if necessary, to resolve ambiguities (3) . Data are mapped into a computer friendly format and transferred between applications using Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1). This validation and encoding supports the interoperable display of sequence, structure and alignment. Uniformly defined secondary-structure and 3D-domain features are added to support structure neighbor calculations. MMDB currently contains 39 000 structure entries, corresponding to 90 000 chains and 170 000 3D domains.
The MMDB web server generates structure summary pages, which provide a concise description of an MMDB entry's content and the available annotation (4). Sequences derived from MMDB are entered into Entrez's protein or nucleic acid sequence database, preserving links to the corresponding 3D structures. Links to PubMed are generated by matching citations. Links to Entrez's organism taxonomy database are generated by semi-automatic processing of 'source records' and other descriptive text provided by PDB. Ligands and other small molecules are identified and added to the PubChem resource, accessible at http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov, also preserving reciprocal links to 3D structure. VAST (7) . The 3D structure viewer supported by Entrez, Cn3D (8), provides molecular-graphics visualization.
The 'Related Structure' service
In the Entrez database system, protein sequences are neighbored to each other by comparing each newly entered sequence to all other database entries. These database scans are run with the BLAST (5) engine, which identifies sequence neighbors with significant similarity, and the resulting sequence identifiers and taxonomy indices are stored, so that Entrez can provide 'Related Sequences' links for all protein records in the collection. The 'Related Structure' service is built on top of this system. Sequence neighbors directly linked to MMDB are identified and alignments are recomputed by employing the 'BlastTwoSequences' tool (9) to restore alignment footprints. The 'Related Structure' web interface provides direct access to this information. Initially this service had been restricted to sequences from microbial genomes (10), but it has now been expanded to cover all proteins in Entrez and is updated daily to provide a comprehensive 3D-structure annotation service. Identification of structure-linked neighbors and the visualization of sequencestructure alignment is also possible using Entrez and the Cn3D alignment viewer/editor, but 'Related Structures' provides a convenient new summary and 'one click' shortcuts to 3D visualization. These 3D views may be used to identify conserved residues and map site-specific features derived from the 3D structure. Currently 48% of non-identical protein sequences in Entrez have been linked to at least one related structure, employing a conservative threshold for alignment length (50 aligned residues or more) and similarity (30% or more identical residues in the aligned footprint); see Figure 1 for details.
A search with the term 'Angiotensin converting enzyme' in Entrez's protein database retrieves >400 hits. One may configure the Entrez browser to filter search results by various criteria, and one pre-configured filter selects those protein sequences with 'Related Structures' (configuration of Entrez can be achieved by following links to 'My NCBI', or by clicking on the 'toolbox' icon shown at the top of Entrez document summaries.). In this example, the 'Related Structures' filter shows that >240 of the identified sequence records have links to related structures.
One such protein sequence is the ACE protein from Rattus norvegicus (accession no. 'NP_036676'). On the 'Links' menu for this record, 'Related structures' generates a request to the Related Structure service (http://structure.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/Structure/cblast/cblast.cgi?client=entrez&query_gi= 6978757). The resulting page indicates with a horizontal bar, the sequence region annotated by each related structure ( Figure 2 ). The display also supports sorting by a variety of alignment parameters such as score or length and selection of sequence-dissimilar 'non redundant' subsets. A ' Table' option switches to a text view, listing descriptions of each structure as well as alignment scores.
Using the table view with this example, one may notice that several related structures are complexes of the same protein with different drugs/inhibitors, e.g. structures with PDB codes 1O86 (11), 1UZF (12) and 1UZE (12) . Clicking on the graphical alignment footprint of 1O86, a human ACE enzyme in complex with lisinopril, one can see a text representation of the corresponding BLAST alignment, and a Cn3D view of the alignment can be launched by clicking on 'Get 3D Structure data' (Figure 3 ). One may see that the query protein is highly similar in sequence to the human ACE enzyme, as identical residue pairs are colored red by default. The sequence identity across the aligned region is 82%, and it Figure 1 . Non-identical protein sequences in Entrez have been classified into groups linked to related structures, at various levels of sequence similarity. Sequence identity is calculated from the BLAST alignments, and here only those neighbor relationships are listed that produce an aligned footprint of 50 residues or more. The analysis also excludes protein sequences which have been directly obtained from MMDB. Forty-eight percent of sequences in Entrez protein have at least one structure neighbor with an extensive alignment footprint and at least 30% identical residues. appears that the core of the structure is mostly formed by residues conserved between the two aligned rows, while non-conserved residues are mainly located on the structure's surface.
One may further identify the catalytic center by identifying residues that contact the catalytic Zinc ion. Those sites can then be mapped from the structure to aligned regions in the sequence window using Cn3D's highlighting functionality. One may also examine the sequence-structure alignments with related structures 1UZE and 1UZF, human ACE binding to enalaprilat and captopril, respectively, drugs with chemical structures similar to that of lisinopril. This allows one to identify conserved interactions between the ACE enzyme and this series of antihypertensive drugs. Similarly, by examining the related structure 2AJF (13), one may be able to identify residues critical for cross-species infection by studying the protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain from SARS Coronavirus Spike and human versus rat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
The 'Related Structure' service is also integrated with NCBI's protein BLAST service. A 'Related Structures' link is provided when one or more similar proteins with known 3D structures have been identified by BLAST. The NCBI single-nucleotide polymorphism resource (SNP) also links to the 'Related Structure' service, which in this context provides a mapping of both synonymous and non-synonymous coding SNPs onto experimentally determined 3D structures. 'Related Structure' may be expanded further in the future, to provide visualization for other NCBI resources and to support additional filtering and selection among related structures, e.g. to highlight those annotated with conserved domain footprints by the CDD resource or those linked to small molecules in the PubChem database.

86,fef0bb9eaac69559d0ff2f92ff83e0affd4435f0,"The broad range and diversity of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) function to induce an antiviral state within the host, impeding viral pathogenesis. While successful respiratory viruses overcome individual ISG effectors, analysis of the global ISG response and subsequent viral antagonism has yet to be examined. Employing models of the human airway, transcriptomics and proteomics datasets were used to compare ISG response patterns following highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI)
IMPORTANCE This work combines systems biology and experimental validation to identify and confirm strategies used by viruses to control the immune response. Using a novel screening approach, specific comparison between highly pathogenic influenza viruses and coronaviruses revealed similarities and differences in strategies to control the interferon and innate immune response. These findings were subsequently confirmed and explored, revealing both a common pathway of antagonism via type I interferon (IFN) delay as well as a novel avenue for control by altered histone modification. Together, the data highlight how comparative systems biology analysis can be combined with experimental validation to derive novel insights into viral pathogenesis.","stimulation, and overall lethality (4) . Together, the similarities and differences offer an opportunity to identify both conserved and pathogen-specific host responses important during respiratory virus infection.
While previous studies have undertaken global analysis built on systems biology datasets (5) (6) (7) (8) , we took a new approach that focused on a parameter known to be important to viral infection: the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) response. Type I IFN induces a signaling cascade that provides the first line of defense against viral pathogens and initiates transcription of hundreds of ISGs that have antiviral, immune modulatory, and cell regulatory functions (9) . Successful viral pathogens, including CoVs and influenza viruses, have evolved genetic functions that antagonize pathogen recognition as well as ISG effector functions (10, 11) . Yet, as a whole, the ISG response has never been globally examined in the context of multiple viral pathogens in the same system; therefore, we sought to compare and contrast ISG control strategies employed by influenza A and pathogenic CoVs.
Using virologic and transcriptomic data, the results demonstrated distinct approaches used by each virus to interfere with the global ISG response. Differences and similarities were noted between strains within each virus family, and expression patterns were further validated by proteomic data. Finally, computational and empirical studies provided insights into conserved and novel mechanisms of ISG control. Whereas the HPAI virus actively manipulated the ISG response with up-and downregulation of ISG subsets, H1N1-09 produced strong, uniform induction. In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV successfully delayed ISG expression until after peak viral titers were achieved. Notably, MERS-CoV also downregulated a subset of ISGs, overlapping part of the signature seen with HPAI virus. Mechanistic studies revealed that absent and delayed IFN induction was responsible for the ISG antagonism observed in the CoVs. In addition, ISG downregulation in both HPAI virus and MERS-CoV was not due to disruption of signaling but rather correlates with altered histone modification, a novel avenue to impede ISG transcription. Finally, varied antagonism of HPAI virus mutants suggested that NS1 contributes to ISG control via altered histone methylation and may impact virulence in other severe influenza virus infections. Together, the data highlight unique and conserved approaches used by disparate respiratory viral pathogens to manipulate and control the global ISG responses.
ISG expression varies based on cell and tissue type. Therefore, we set out to define ISGs in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line permissive for both CoV and influenza infection. Calu3 cells were treated with type I IFN (IFN-␣ or IFN-␤), resulting in differential expression of Ͼ350 genes (log 2 fold change [FC] of Ͼ1.5, adjusted P value of Ͻ0.05; Fig. 1A ). Using these data, a consensus ISG list was developed from genes induced at more than one time point (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) and then used to examine ISG expression changes following infection. While cytopathic effect (CPE) in both H5N1-VN1203 and H1N1-09 required a slightly lower multiplicity of infection (MOI) to maximize comparable time points, infection of the cultures was uniform (Ͼ95% infection), as measured by CPE or fluorescent virus infection. In addition, each infection maintained similar kinetics in terms of both replication and genomic RNA production despite differing endpoint titers ( Fig.  1B and C) .
Following IFN-␣ treatment or infection, the ISG RNA expression patterns showed both similarities and stark contrasts (Fig. 1D ). H1N1-09 quickly and robustly induced the majority (97%) of ISGs, mimicking type I IFN treatment. However, H5N1-VN1203 induced robust induction in only 35% of the consensusannotated ISGs (log 2 FC of Ͼ0.75 at 24 h postinfection [hpi]) (Fig. 1D, orange panel) ; in contrast, a significant subset of ISGs (26%) had only minimal induction (green panel). Finally, the largest percentage (39%; log 2 FC of ϽϪ0.75 at 24 hpi, purple and blue panels) was downregulated relative to mock following H5N1-VN1203 infection. Based on these groupings, the same ISGs were almost uniformly upregulated in response to H1N1-09 infection (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, ISG expression was neither strongly up-nor downregulated following the first 12 h of SARS-CoV infection; only after 24 to 36 hpi are the majority (88% at 72 hpi) of ISGs induced. However, several ISGs showed only minimal, if any, stimulation (e.g., TLR3, SERPIN1), and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, was downregulated, corresponding with previous reports (12) . For MERS-CoV, the first 12 h also found no significant ISG induction, after which expression mirrored H5N1-VN1203 with upregulation (42%), no stimulation (39%), and downregulation (19%) of ISG subsets (see Table S1 ). Together, these results demonstrate contrasting and overlapping approaches used by H5N1-VN1203, H1N1-09, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in their regulation of the global ISG response.
Proteomic analysis validated ISG antagonism following CoV and influenza virus infection. In parallel to RNA expression experiments, infected Calu3 cells were examined by global proteomics analysis. Numerous factors affect proteomics coverage, including a protein's solubility, hydrophobicity, and location within the cell, thus preventing analysis of major protein subsets, including secreted and membrane-bound peptides. Despite these limitations, significant changes in protein levels provided independent validation of the RNA expression trends. For H1N1-09, the limited control of ISG RNA expression also manifested in robust ISG protein production; 27 ISG proteins were among 530 significantly upregulated host proteins (P or G test value of Ͻ0.05 at any time point; see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material), with production detected as early as 12 hpi and the majority of ISG protein (63%) produced by 24 hpi. In contrast, only 3 of the 382 proteins significantly upregulated by H5N1-VN1203 belonged to the consensus ISG list, validating the RNA expression analysis. While SARS-CoV induces 20 ISG proteins over its 72-h time course, none of these ISG proteins are detected prior to 30 hpi; similarly, MERS-CoV induces five ISG proteins, with only one (STAT1) detected prior to 18 hpi, thus confirming delayed ISG induction in both CoVs.
Examination of individual protein expression patterns also confirmed these trends. Although most ISGs are absent in mock samples, two detectable proteins were expressed at basal levels: STAT1 and PKR. H5N1-VN1203 infection had reduced protein expression of both STAT1 (27.4% decrease at 24 hpi) and PKR (28.5% decrease at 18 hpi) relative to that of mock; similarly, MERS-CoV reduced the protein level of STAT1 (15.8% decrease at 18 to 24 hpi) and PKR (20.2% decrease at 18 to 24 hpi) (see Fig. S1B ). In contrast, both proteins were significantly increased following both H1N1-09 and SARS-CoV infection; however, the increase occurred only at late times (Ͼ30 hpi) for SARS-CoV, contrasting that for H1N1-09. Further examination of individual ISGs found a consistent linkage between mRNA expression (see Fig. S1B , solid line) and protein abundance (dotted line). For H1N1-09, mRNA upregulation by 3 to 7 hpi corresponded to parallel protein production 7 to 12 h later for ISGs; representative kinetics for MX1, OAS2, and IFIT family members are shown (see Fig. S1C ). A similar mRNA/protein kinetic relationship was observed for SARS-CoV, showing delayed RNA induction, which allowed viral replication to peak prior to ISG protein production (see Fig. S1D ). For both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV, this analysis was excluded due to insufficient detectable data to produce a representative curve. Together, the proteomics data validated the RNA expression results and confirmed unique strategies to control the ISG response between different viral strains and families.
Having established differential ISG regulation at both the RNA and protein levels, we next sought to determine the means of control. One possible global mechanism is to prevent, disrupt, or delay initial induction of either type I or type III IFN, another important antiviral cytokine. While several IFN-independent ISGs exist, the vast majority of genes are augmented by IFN production (9); naturally, both CoV and influenza family members have developed approaches to prevent this induction by disturbing the sensing pathways (10, 11) . Yet, despite the presence of antagonists, both H5N1-VN1203 and H1N1-09 infection resulted in robust transcription of type I and type III IFN molecules ( Fig. 2A) ; IFN-␤1, IFN-␣5, and IFN-1 were each strongly induced in both influenza strains. These results are consistent with Table S1 in the supplemental material). All ISG and analysis available online as outlined in data dissemination (supplement). Viral titers (B) and viral genomic RNA (C) following infection of Calu3 cells previous reports for both viruses (13, 14) and indicated host recognition via intact sensing pathways despite the presence of IFN antagonists like NS1. In contrast, SARS-CoV infection resulted in IFN-␤ induction only after 12 h (Fig. 2) ; IFN-␣5 and IFN-1 were even further delayed and dampened compared to those in the influenza infections. Similarly, MERS-CoV failed to induce IFN genes prior to 12 h but also induced more robust IFN-␣5 relative to that of SARS-CoV, possibly implicating signaling differences in antagonism between the two CoVs. Together, the IFN induction data indicated that unlike the influenza strains, CoV infections more tightly block recognition and/or disrupt IFN induction. Coupled with previous reports of the sensitivity of SARS-and MERS-CoV to type I IFN (15, 16) , these data argued that delayed ISG expression enhances CoV infection.
Transcriptional factor binding preference corresponds with differential ISG expression. For H1N1-09 infection, robust IFN expression syncs with observed global ISG induction (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, while the strong induction of type I and III IFN corresponds to previous reports for H5N1-VN1203 (14), the up-and downregulation of ISG subsets indicate that the global IFN response is altered by the more virulent influenza strain. Notably, while blocking recognition pathways and IFN signaling have been described as means to impair ISG induction (10, 17) , neither approach would directly result in ISG downregulation relative to mock. In fact, the results suggest that H5N1-VN1203 ISG antagonism occurs after pathway activation, possibly through interfering with transcriptional factor binding. However, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of IRF7-, STAT1-, and NF-B-dependent genes demonstrated no uniform pattern of either specific induction or repression 12 h after H5N1-VN1203 infection (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material; also, data not shown); in addition, IPA upstream Z scoring, a value based on downstream expression of connected genes, revealed lower activation scores for these transcriptional factors in H5N1-VN1203 than in H1N1-09 but no evidence of repression (Z score Ͻ Ϫ2.0), reflecting both increased and decreased downstream ISG expression (see Fig. S2B to D). The analysis suggested that H5N1-VN1203 does not achieve downregulation via blockade of transcriptional factors; instead, these data and IFN expression values indicate that upstream ISG signaling remains intact.
While unable to completely block activation, H5N1-VN1203 may dampen the total amount of activated transcriptional factor via antagonists like NS1. With limited availability, transcriptional factor binding preference may drive differential expression. To explore this possibility, we focused on STAT1-dependent/augmented ISGs as determined by the IPA knowledge base; the results identified broad variation in ISG expression despite their similar dependence on STAT1 (Fig. 3A ). To verify that transcriptional factor binding contributed to this observation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) targeting STAT1, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to examine target promoter binding. The results indicated that CXCL10 and IFIT1, highly expressed ISGs following H5N1-VN1203 infection ( Fig. 3A) , had a corresponding increase in STAT1 binding in their 5= promoter region at 12 hpi (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, CFHR1 and APOL6, ISGs with decreased expression, had no increase in STAT1 binding despite the presence of activated STAT1 in those cells. For each of these genes, we had identified consensus STAT1 GAS motifs (TTC[N 2-4]GAA) within 1 kb of the translational start site and 200 bp downstream (18) ; the number of these motifs varied by gene (CXCL10 [2] , IFIT1 [1] , CFHR1 [1] , APOL6 [1]) but did not dictate expression of STAT1. Notably, similar variation despite STAT1 dependence was observed following MERS-CoV infection as well as with STAT1 ChIP-PCR results (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Together, the results indicated that differential promoter binding exists between genes activated by STAT1 and possibly contributes to differential ISG expression in H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infections. Altered histone modification plays a significant role in both H5N1 and MERS-CoV ISG antagonism. A number of factors can impact transcriptional factor binding preference, including the promoter binding sequence, site of phosphorylation, and underlying chromatin structure (19, 20) . We initially chose to focus on chromatin structure based on a number of studies that implicated a role for chromatin remodeling during influenza virus infection (21) (22) (23) and identification of histone mimic (24) . Histone modification can mediate a variety of diverse biological processes, including gene regulation (25, 26) . These changes can result in rapid chromatin remodeling, including activation (opening) or repres-sion (closing) depending on the location, type, and number of modifications. While the NS1 histone mimic motif is absent in both H1N1-09 and H5N1-VN1203, other findings suggest that histone remodeling strategies may be conserved across influenza strains (21) (22) (23) . Coupled with substantial downregulation of ISG subsets during H5N1 infection, these facts encouraged us to investigate histone changes. We performed ChIP using antibodies for either an active form of histone H3 (H3K4me3) or a repressive form (H3K27me3) in the context of H5N1-VN1203 or H1N1-09 infection (25) . We then targeted the 5= untranslated region (UTR) of three ISGs with differential expression between the influenza strains (CFHR1, DDX58 [encodes RIG-I], and SMAD9L) and one with similar expression (IRF9) by quantitative real-time PCR. For H1N1-09, H3K4me3 was strongly associated with the 5=UTR of upregulated ISGs compared to mock (Fig. 4A ). In contrast, these same genes, with downregulated RNA expression in H5N1-VN1203 infection, were also found to have significantly reduced association with H3K4me3, suggesting the absence of the active H3 motif. Examining the repressive H3K27me3 revealed enhanced association with CFHR1, DDX58, and SMAD9L during H5N1-VN1203 infection (Fig. 4B) ; no significant H3K27me3 association was observed for these genes following H1N1-09 infection. IRF9, an ISG upregulated following both H1N1-09 and H5N1-VN1203 infection, demonstrated similar trends for both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, with no significant differences observed between the strains (Fig. 4A and B) . Together, the results indicate that altered histone modification occurs in the context of H5N1-VN1203 infection and these patterns of change correlate with the observed differences in ISG antagonism.
Having demonstrated significant differences in histone modification patterns that correlate with expression outcomes between influenza strains, we returned to the CoVs. While both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV maintain delayed IFN induction (Fig. 2) , MERS-CoV also downregulated a subset of ISGs with kinetics similar to those of H5N1-VN1203 (Fig. 1D) ; no similar subset was observed during SARS-CoV infection. Given its increased sensitivity to type I IFN (15, 16) , one possibility is that MERS-CoV employed an additional layer of ISG antagonism via altered histone modification. To test this idea, ChIP-PCR was again employed following both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection. The results demonstrated that two genes (TLR3 and CFHR1) downregulated in both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV infection, had decreased association with activating H3K4me3 (Fig. 4C ) and increased association with the repressive H3K27me3 motif (Fig. 4D) . In contrast, DDX58, a gene downregulated by H5N1-VN1203 but not MERS-CoV, actually had reduced H3K27me3 association following MERS-CoV infection. Similar to previous reports (27), the activating histone mark was variable in uninduced SARS-CoV-infected samples at 12 hpi; however, a late time point (36 hpi) that corresponded with robust ISG expression demonstrated increased H3K4me3 and reduced H3K27me3 modifications relative to mock (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). Together, the data suggested that while the activating motif was less predictable, the dominant H3K27me3 repressive histone mark was associated only with ISGs downregulated by both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 (28) .
To explore how H5N1-VN1203 mediates ISG control, we next focused on viral proteins linked to H5N1-VN1203 virulence and IFN manipulation: NS1, PB1-F2, and PB2 (29) (30) (31) (32) . To test the contributions of these viral proteins, Calu3 cells were infected with H5N1-VN1203 mutants containing a C-terminal truncation of NS1 (NS1trunc124), a deletion of PB1-F2 (PB1-F2del), or PB2 encoding an amino acid substitution (PB2-K627E) that significantly reduces polymerase activity. For each, viral replication and ISG induction was compared to those of the wild type (WT) and demonstrated attenuated replication, noting that each mutant virus replicated to equivalent titers at 18 to 24 h (see Fig. S5A in the supplemental material). However, ISG induction kinetics varied between both the WT virus and each mutant (Fig. 5A) . For the PB1-F2del and PB2-K627E mutants, a significant subset of ISGs (48.5% for PB1-F2del and 38.8% for PB2-K627E; data not shown) had augmented expression (Ͼ1.5 log 2 FC) compared to the WT at 24 hpi; however, 95% of genes downregulated in WT infections also remained downregulated (24%, ϽϪ0.75 log 2 FC expression) or uninduced (74%, Ͻ1.5 log 2 FC expression) by both of these mutants. In contrast, compared to WT H5N1-VN1203, the NS1trunc124 mutant induced a larger subset and augmented expression (71%) of ISGs (Ͼ1.5 log 2 FC) (data not shown). Importantly, of the 41 consensus ISGs downregulated during H5N1 infection, 38 were no longer downregulated and over half (51%) were upregulated (Ͼ1.5 log 2 FC expression) following infection with the mutant NS1 virus. Proteomics analysis validated these results, demonstrating increased protein expression of 11 ISGs in H5N1-NS1trunc124 infection, including MDA5, MX1, and IFIT1, which were not detectable in WT infection (see Fig. S3B ). Together, these results suggest that the NS1 C terminus plays a role in selective ISG downregulation and makes a strong contribution to global ISG control following H5N1-VN1203 infection.
Having established NS1 as a required component for strong ISG manipulation and downregulation, we next sought to determine if histone modifications of specific ISGs were modified in H5N1-NS1trunc124 infections. For this, we repeated the ChIP-PCR experiment with WT and NS1trunc124 viruses ( Fig. 5B and C). Similar to what was previously observed, ISGs that were transcriptionally downregulated in WT infections (i.e., SMAD9L, CFHR1, and DDX58) were strongly associated with repressed histones (H3K27me3) and only weakly associated with active histones (H3K4me3). In contrast, the absence of full-length NS1 resulted in augmented association of the same transcripts with the active H3K4me3 and reduced binding to the inhibitory H3K27me3 mark. Together, the data demonstrated that histone modifications were altered in the absence of full-length NS1 and may result in the augmented ISG RNA and protein expression following NS1trunc124 mutant virus infection.
We next sought to determine if NS1 from another highly pathogenic virus mediated a similar global ISG response. With this in mind, a meta-analysis was conducted on mRNA expression data from A549 cells infected with pandemic 1918 H1N1 and a 1918 H1N1 mutant expressing NS1 from a seasonal H1N1 strain (A/Texas/36/91 [TX]) (33) . Each of these viruses maintained a full-length NS1 but lacked the histone mimic motif found in H3N2. Confirming the original findings, several ISGs had a substantial increase in expression after infection with recombinant virus encoding the TX NS1 compared to the WT 1918 NS1 (Fig. 5D) . However, expanding the examination to the consensus ISG list derived from Calu3 cells to the A549 cell metadata revealed that expression of ISGs was not uniformly downregulated with 1918 NS1. Instead, many ISGs had equivalent expression levels, and several (IFITM1, ZBP1, HSH2D, etc.) had greater expression with 1918 NS1 than TX NS1. These results suggest that NS1 substitution from a more virulent strain does not always result in uniform ISG augmentation but rather targets ISG manipulation based on strain specific NS1 activity. Notably, ISG downregulation was absent in the less virulent TX NS1 (0 genes) compared to in the 1918 NS1 (21% ϽϪ0.25 log 2 FC at 24 hpi); coupled with data from H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infections, these results suggest that pathogenic respiratory viruses may downregulate a subset of ISGs via histone modification and contribute to effective infection and enhanced virulence.
This study demonstrates contrasting, similar, and novel avenues used by virulent respiratory viruses to dampen and impair the global ISG response. HPAI utilizes rapid manipulation resulting in both strong up-and downregulation of ISG subsets rather than a binary ISG response. In contrast, the less virulent H1N1-09 virus fails to modulate either ISG transcripts or protein, producing a robust antiviral state which may impact peak titers. Similarly, SARS-CoV infection stimulates robust ISG transcription and protein production; however, ISGs are delayed 24 to 48 h, permitting SARS-CoV to achieve peak titers prior to ISG production. Finally, MERS-CoV not only delays ISG induction but also manipulates a subset of ISGs, similar to H5N1-VN1203. Together, the data highlight methods that pathogenic viruses utilize to control the host antiviral state. In each case, the strategy contributes to successful infection and may explain differences in virulence seen between viral families and strains.
In addition to identifying differential ISG induction profiles, this study also introduces a novel avenue for viral antagonism of host gene expression via altered histone modification (Fig. 6) . A large number of host enzymes catalyze methylation and demethylation of histones, a process that is essential for regulating transcriptional programs (26, 34) . In particular, innate immune responses, including ISG responses, are highly regulated by epigenetic control mechanisms, including alteration of methylation and acylation patterns in chromatin (35, 36) . By catalyzing the placement or removal of histone methyl marks at H3K4 (transcriptionally active) and H3K27 (transcriptionally repressive), histone lysine methyltransferases (MLL2, MLL3, and EZH2) and demethylases (RBP2, UTX, and JMJD3) modify the chromatin state to maintain and fine-tune transcriptional control (26) . During H1N1-09 or SARS-CoV infection, the host cell recognizes the viruses, produces type I and type III IFN, and induces histone modulation complexes to remove the repressive histone marks (H3K27me3) and add activating modifications (H3K4me3); this process shifts targeted chromosomal locations to a more open, activated state and permits the binding of activated transcription factors like STAT1 and IRF7, allowing robust ISG expression. In contrast, during MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection, some histones undergo the activating modifications resulting in robust expression of a subset of ISGs; however, for another subset of genes, chromatin remodeling complexes incorporate the repressive histone modification (H3K27me3) while also removing the active marker (H3K4me3), resulting in a condensed chromatin structure. This closed structure likely excludes transcription factors and reduces RNA expression of target ISGs. While differences in transcriptional factor phosphorylation state or binding sites may also contribute, the altered histone modification approach suppresses expression of target genes. While histone modification has been shown to play a role in a variety of host processes, including cell development (37) , host metabolism (38) , and ISG induction (36) , these findings represent additional evidence that pathogens can exploit the same repression processes to modulate and control the host IFN response (39, 40) ; similar modulation by pathogens likely impacts other critical host processes, including inflammation, antigen presentation, and aging (26, 34) . The presence of this antagonism in disparate, highly virulent respiratory pathogens not only supports earlier studies involving the H3N2 NS1 histone mimic (24) but also suggests that the approach may be conserved across multiple viral families and contribute to enhanced disease virulence. The large number of cellular proteins present within histone modification complexes potentially provides a rich diversity of targets for pathogen-coded control and manipulation (26) . Importantly, antagonizing histone regulation may also prove to be an important factor in the emergence of both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV; broad evolutionary conservation of both histone modifications and machinery suggests that host targets may be conserved across diverse species, potentially easing cross-species infection by modulation of the host response (41) . However, the effect may also be reducing transmission efficiency by removing portions of the adaption requirements for host shifting. Future studies explore avian-and bat-derived cells for conservation of virus-mediated histone modification.
For influenza viruses, ISG expression differences between H5N1-VN1203 and H1N1-09 highlighted possible virulence determinants. Numerous reports have shown that specific influenza proteins impede the type I IFN response by targeting host signaling molecules and transcription factors (9, 10); together, the studies imply that disruption of these components results in a loss or dampening of the entire pathway's downstream components. However, robust IFN production following H5N1-VN1203 infection confounds this interpretation (21) (22) (23) ; instead, these data argue that during H5N1-VN1203 infection, host recognition and IFN signaling remain largely intact and a hierarchy in ISG activation exists. In contrast, the less virulent H1N1-09 virus lacks similar ISG antagonism both at the RNA and protein levels. Several HPAI viral protein functions may have contributed to ISG downregulation prior to mRNA production, including cap snatching, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) interference, and/or microRNA targeting (42) (43) (44) . However, each possibility would lead to nonspecific degradation of mRNA and thus could not explain the differential ISG expression observed in these studies. In contrast, significant changes in histone activation and repression marks, coupled with interaction with histone components (21) (22) (23) and the recent discovery of a histone mimic in H3N2 infection (17, 24) , provided a rational avenue for the observed contrast in ISG antagonism.
Mechanistically, C-terminal truncation of NS1 ablated global ISG antagonism for H5N1-VN1203. While mutations in PB1-F2 and PB2 resulted in significant ISG augmentation, the majority of ISGs maintain low or downregulated expression. In contrast, NS1 truncation halted ISG downregulation by H5N1-VN1203 and enhanced expression of a significant subset of ISGs at both the RNA and protein levels. This ISG stimulation occurred despite the presence of both the RNA-binding domain and part of the effector domain for NS1 (45) . Infection with the NS1 truncation mutant also resulted in reduced association with the repressive H3K27me3 and increased association with the active H3K4me3, identifying a role for NS1 in altered histone modification. Together, the data indicate a role for NS1 beyond just IFN pathway inhibition and identifies histone modification as a new target for ISG antagonism in H5N1-VN1203 infection.
While NS1 histone mimicry has been identified in an H3N2 virus, the responsible binding motif is not contained in either H5N1-VN1203 or 1918 H1N1 (24) . This suggests that the C-terminal portion of NS1 may mediate selective ISG subset downregulations through different mechanisms depending on strain. For H5N1-VN1203, NS1 may target a similar functional pathway as H3N2 by mimicking different histones, targeting histone-modifying enzymes, or disrupting a histone adaptor protein complex. For H1N1-09, it suggests that the absent 11-aminoacid C-terminal truncation of NS1 may contribute to its relative lack of ISG antagonism; this absent tail has multiple functional domains in addition to possible histone modification elements (17, 46, 47) . Together, these possibilities illustrate the complexity of NS1 and the caveats of analyzing its contribution to histone modification; however, further study with the plethora of H5N1-VN1203 and H1N1-09 viral mutants provides a golden opportunity to further characterize NS1's role in ISG manipulation.
The data also lent the possibility that NS1 from other pathogenic influenza strains may mediate differential antagonism of the ISG subset in addition to interfering with host recognition. Metaanalysis of NS1 from 1918 H1N1 and a seasonal influenza virus supports this possibility; while derived from Calu3 cells, the expanded ISG list demonstrated that control was altered between virulent and avirulent strains based on NS1, and the data indicated that the directions of expression changes were not uniformly in favor of the more virulent strain. Variant responses in viruses encoding different NS1 genes imply the existence of categories of NS1 genes that may target different aspects of the host immune response. This fact, coupled with highly species-specific virulence determinants (48, 49) , suggests that NS1 genes may circulate and contribute to species-specific severe disease outcomes, perhaps by coordinating unique patterns of histone modification that regulate the ISG in addition to standard IFN pathway antagonism. Importantly, exploring the global mechanism of ISG manipulation by NS1 genes within the context of infection, in addition to transfection-based approaches, will provide significant insights into disease severity across different hosts, tissues, and species.
The data also highlight the ability of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to inhibit recognition, delay IFN induction, and sequester ISG production until after peak viral titers had been achieved. This ability effectively neutralizes the innate immune response and permits both CoVs to establish a foothold within the lung prior to recognition. However, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV also utilize additional divergent approaches to limit the host IFN response. While SARS-CoV IFN antagonism is well established (11) , MERS-CoV appears to employ different, less effective antagonists, resulting in increased sensitivity to type I IFN pretreatment (15, 16) . However, altered histone modification represents a novel CoV antagonism approach. While newly emergent, several MERS-CoV proteins have been identified as IFN antagonists (50, 51) ; notably, ORF4b, a MERS accessory protein with no homologue in SARS-CoV, maintains a purported nuclear localization signal, exhibits nuclear localization based on transfection, and may play a role in IFN antagonism (51) . Further studies are under way utilizing the MERS-CoV infectious clone (52) and attempt to identify viral components required to mediate altered histone modification.
Overall, this study combines a systems biology approach that integrates complex RNA and proteomics datasets across different virus infections with detailed molecular and cell biology validation approaches to identify novel patterns and mechanisms of virus-host interaction and innate immune regulation.

nt factor during viral infection, global analysis has been limited by the lack of uniform platforms, infection conditions, and data collection methods. Establishing conditions that afford comparisons across systems virology datasets alleviated these problems and permitted analysis beyond a single treatment or infection condition. The resulting study revealed similarities and stark contrasts in terms of ISG induction between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, an HPAI virus, and a 2009 pandemic influenza virus strain, which likely contribute to differences in disease outcomes and may help our understanding of these infections. Importantly, discovery-based studies informed molecular approaches that identified a novel avenue of immune antagonism utilized by two diverse viral families, providing a new area for exploration and study. This study highlights the power and utility of combining systems biology and standard molecular-based approaches in emerging infectious disease research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Calu3 cells were utilized as previously described (5-7). Viral titrations and propagation of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus were performed in VeroE6 and MDCK cells using standard methods. Wild-type (WT) icSARS-CoV was derived from the Baric laboratory's infectious clone (ic) constructs (53) . MERS-CoV (EMC 2012 strain) was kindly provided by Bart L. Haagmans, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands, via Material Transfer Agreement. Influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1-09), influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1-VN1203), and H5N1-VN1203 mutants (NS1trunc124, PB1-F2del, and PB2-K627E) were derived from a plasmid-based reversegenetic system and subsequently amplified in MDCK cells (54) .

ChIP-PCR. ChIP analysis was performed using the EpiTect ChIP OneDay kit (Qiagen). Briefly, infected Calu3 cells were cross-linked, harvested, and frozen at Ϫ80°C. Cells were then lysed and chromatin sheared via sonication to generate chromatin fragments between 250 and 1,000 bp.

To determine the histone modification distribution, quantitative realtime PCR was performed targeting the 5=UTR (Ϫ750 bp-TSS [region 750 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site]) of select genes; target and primer information is included in the supplemental material. ChIP results were reported as fold difference (or differential occupancy), allowing comparison across multiple samples. For this, each sample was normalized to the input and then the fold enrichment was calculated using the ⌬⌬C T method. The fold difference for each gene was determined by dividing the appropriate time-matched mock by the experimental group. Finally, the fold difference values were converted to log 2 and plotted.

Meta-analysis of A549 cells infected with H1N1 1918 viruses. RNA expression data from studies with H1N1 1918 virus infections (33) were reanalyzed, and ISG expression was examined. Two-channel analysis was performed using R statistical programming language and bioconductor package LIMMA. To lower variance, two channel arrays were background corrected with a zero value and normalized with the Loess method.

87,f3a90e6992ef81870180a64caea939eccefee16c,"Proteins p38 map kinase and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) as members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles against pathogens. In this study, Bmp38 and BmS6K were identified as differentially expressed proteins from iTRAQ database. Bmp38 and BmS6K were expressed, and recombinant proteins were purified. The bioinformatics analysis showed that both proteins have serine/threonine-protein kinases, catalytic domain (S_ TKc) with 360 and 753 amino acids, respectively. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6K had high expression in the midgut and hemolymph. The comparative expression level of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 was upregulated than in P50 in the midgut after Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. Western bolt results showed a positive correlation between RT-qPCR and iTRAQ data for Bmp38, but BmS6K data showed partial correlation with iTRAQ. Injection of anti-Bmp38 and anti-BmS6K serum suggested that Bmp38 may be involved against BmNPV infection, whereas BmS6K may require phosphorylation modification to inhibit BmNPV infection. Taken together, our results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6k might play an important role in innate immunity of silkworm against BmNPV.","Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are class of evolutionarily conserved protein with Ser/Thr kinase domain. MAPKs have been widely identified from vertebrates to invertebrates, which involve in different signaling transduction pathways (Roux and Blenis 2004) . MAPK family can be classified into three major groups: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), C-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPKs (Marie Cargnello 2011). In addition, MAPKs are triggered by phosphorylation of conserved TxY motifs present in their Ser/Thr kinase domains. Among them, p38 and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) are members of MAPKs play a wide range of functions in various biological processes including apoptosis, pathogen infection, cell differentiation, inflammatory response, UV stress, and environmental stress (Yee et al. 2004 , Regan et al. 2009 , Fenton and Gout 2011 . Both p38 and S6K MAPK homolog have been studied in vertebrates and invertebrates (Han et al. 1998, Fenton and Gout 2011) .
Innate immune response is conserved from higher to lower organisms and plays vital role against pathogenic infection (Shahzad et al. 2017) . Previous studies have shown that p38 MAPK triggered inflammatory response and initiated innate immune responses in shrimp . Moreover, some studied also discovered that p38 MAPKs are also initiated during mammalian viral infection and involve in viral replication (Banerjee et al. 2002 , Hirasawa et al. 2003 . Wei et al. (2015) revealed that p38 MAPK involved in virus replication during irridovirus infection. p38 MAPKs from Drosophila mediated host defense against bacteria and fungi, as well as p38 pathway involved in stress response (Chen et al. 2010) . S6K belongs to AGC family of kinases, which are a direct substrate of ERK1/ ERK2 (Tavares et al. 2015) . S6K1 and S6K2, homologous of S6K, have been identified in mammals (Gwalter et al. 2009 ). S6K1 and S6K2 when interact with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, their kinase activities are increased (Kuang et al. 2008) . The loss of S6K in Drosophila leads to small cell size and body (Montagne et al. 1999) . Evidence suggests that RSK2 participates in innate immune responses, and its knockdown stimulates the growth of influenza virus (Kakugawa et al. 2009 ).
The silkworm, Bombyx mori (Linnaeus), is a model lepidopteran insect with great economic value (Xia et al. 2004) . Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that exclusively infects the silkworm (Yu et al. 2017b ). To date, most silkworm strains are highly susceptible to BmNPV infection, only a few resistant strains are available ). Owing to BmNPV infection, sericulture undergoes serious economic loss every year. However, there are no effective measures available to control BmNPV infection; thus, investigation is needed to explore the interaction between the host and BmNPV to prevent infection.
In the present study, we analyzed B. mori p38 MAPK and ribosomal S6 kinase proteins, examined their tissue expression, and evaluated their expression at transcription and translation level in response to BmNPV challenge. Taken together, our results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6K may involve in BmNPV infection.
The preservation of silkworm-susceptible strain P50 (LC 50 = 1.03 × 10 5 ) and -resistant strain A35 (LC 50 = 5.90 × 10 7 ) was performed in Key Laboratory of Sericulture and Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China. The near-isogenic line BC9 (LC 50 = 2.27 × 10 6 ) was constructed according to protocol of Wang et al. (2017) . In brief, susceptible strain P50 were crossed with resistant strain A35, and progeny was repeatedly backcrossed with the P50 for nine generations, and each progeny was screened with BmNPV. Hence, the genetic background of BC9 is much similar to the P50, but BC9 should have the resistant background derived from A35. All larvae were reared as described previously (Yu et al. 2017b) . Briefly, fresh mulberry leaves were used to feed larvae. The first-to third-instar larvae were raised in artificial climate chamber at temperature 26 ± 1°C with relative humidity of 75 ± 5% at 12 h day/night cycles, and temperature 24 ± 1°C was used for fourth-and fifth-instar larvae with the same relative humidity and photoperiod as mentioned previously.
BmNPV T3 strain was kept in our laboratory. On the first day of the fifth instar, all larvae were starved for 24 h; 30 silkworm larvae in each of the three independent experiments were administrated 5-µl BmNPV inclusion bodies suspended in water (5 × 10 5 /ml) per os, and the control was treated with 5 µl of sterile water. After 24 h, 30 larval midgut were dissected and mixed together to eliminate individual genetic differences; then, the sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for further use.
Total genomic DNA was isolated using midgut of P50 and BC9 infected with BmNPV injection and oral inoculation, and using the genomic DNA extraction kit, the noninfected larvae were isolated at time 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi (Dalian, Takara, China) . To measure the quantity of all DNA samples, a spectrophotometer (Nano-Drop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, New York, NY) was used. To check the purity of all DNA samples, A 260/280 and A 260/230 absorbance ratio was used, and 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the integrity of DNA. The GP41 primer was showed in Table 1 . Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; GenBank ABA.43638) gene was used as a reference gene because of its suitability described previously (Guo et al. 2016) . The real-time qPCR was performed in a 25-µl reaction mixture containing 12.5 µl of TB Green premix EX Taq (TaKaRa). PCR amplification was performed in triplicate wells. The thermal cycling program was set as denaturation at 95°C for 30 s and 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 20 s. All these reactions were carried out in 96-well plates with a Multicolour Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 2 −ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the relative expression level followed the previously published protocol (Yu et al. 2007 ). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least significance difference (LSD) a posteriori tests were used for statistical analysis by using SPSS software (P < 0.01).
Sequences of primers (5ʹ-3ʹ) Purpose
The underline represented restriction enzyme cutting site. RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction).
The iTRAQ-labeling quantitative proteomic technique was used to identify differentially expressed proteins in P50 (susceptible strain) and near-isogenic line BC9 (resistant strain) according to the mass spectra data (Yu et al. 2017b ). Finally, Bmp38 and BmS6K were identified based on National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant (NCBI-nr) database using basic local alignment search tool. Online ExPASy was used for the analysis of isoelectric point (IP) and molecular weight (MW) of Bmp38 and BmS6K (http:// web.expasy.org/compute_pi/). SMART was used for the conserved domain (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/). To build the phylogenetic tree MEGA 6.0 software was used, following the neighbor-joining method with 1,000-fold bootstrap (Tamura et al. 2013 ).
Silkworms were dissected for the collection of the midgut, hemolymph, fat body, integument, head, and silk gland (pathogen challenged) and using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer's protocol. A Nano-Drop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to determine the concentration, and purification of RNA samples was noticed at A 260/280 . 1% agarose gel electrophoresis was used for checking RNA integrity. According to previous protocol, the RNA samples were then reverse transcribed into cDNA by using Primescript RT Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara; Yu et al. 2018) . Briefly, the concentration was adjusted at 1 µg/µl with nuclear-free water for each RNA sample, and in a 20-µl reaction mixture, the total RNA was reversely transcribed. The mixture was kept in an incubator for 15 min at 37°C and then kept for 5 s at 85°C. The cDNA was kept at temperature of −20°C for future use.
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed for the examination of expression level of Bmp38 and BmS6K in different tissues and under different post-treatments. The primers utilized in this study were designed by Primer Premier 5.0 (www.premierbiosoft.com; Table 1 ). According to the instructions of manufacturer, the real-time quantitative PCR were set with TB Green premix ex Taq (TaKaRa). Briefly, in a 25-µl reaction mixture, the RT-qPCR was performed containing 12.5-µl TB Green, 9.5-µl double-distilled water, 1-µl forward primer, 1-µl reverse primer, and 1-µl cDNA template. The thermal cycling program was set as follows: denaturation at temperature of 95°C for time period of 30 s, 40 cycles of temperature 95°C for 5 s, and 72°C for time of 20 s. Using the 96-well plates with multicolor RT-PCR detection system, the reactions were carried out (Bio-Rad). 2 −ΔΔCt. method was adopted according to the previously published protocol for the calculation of relative expression level (Yu et al. 2007 ). There were three biological sample replications. The B. mori GAPDH was used for normalization. ANOVA and LSD a posteriori tests were used for statistical analysis in SPSS software (P < 0.05).
Primers with restricted enzymes sites of EcoR I and Xho l were designed, the purpose of which was the amplification of Bmp38 and BmS6K domains for the recombinant protein expressions (Table 1) . Using the pMD 19T vector, the PCR products (purified) were cloned as per previous protocol (Yu et al. 2017a ). Positive colonies were randomly selected for sequencing DNA and for the confirmation of amplified sequence. Next, the plasmids were extracted, digested, purified, and ligated into the pET-28a vector (Novagen). The resulting recombinant plasmids pET-28a-Bmp38 and BmS6K were confirmed by DNA sequencing and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3; Novagen) competent cells. After this activity, addition of isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside was done and kept in an incubator for time period of 4 h at 37°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,800 × g for 10 min. For cell pellets suspension, binding buffer (20 mM tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole at pH 7.9) was used. This activity was then disrupted by sonication on ice. The procedure for recombinant proteins purification was used after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for time period of 20 min at temperature of 4°C by using a Ni-NTA Fast Start Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) as per protocol of manufacturer. The quality and identity of purified proteins was evaluated. For this purpose, 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting were performed by using anti-His primary antibody (Transgene Biotech, Beijing, China), and antigenantibody complexes were detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Transgene Biotech; 1:5,000 dilution).
The recombinant Bmp38 and BmS6K proteins in purified form were submitted to HuaAn Biotechnology Ltd. (HUABIO, Hangzhou, China) , to raise rabbit antibody as per protocol described by Yu et al. (2017a) . Similarly, proteins for western blotting proteins were extracted from the various tissues of silkworms as per instructions of previous study (Yu et al. 2017a ). Using a BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) the purified proteins concentrations were quantified. In short, 12% SDS-PAGE gel was used for the separation of prepared protein samples (60 µg). It was then transferred into membranes of polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF). PVDF membrane was blocked overnight using 5% nonfat milk in PBST (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM K 2 HPO 4 , pH 7.5, 0.1% ). It was washed three times with PBST, then used primary antibody (rabbit anti-Bmp38 and anti-BmS6K; diluted 1:5000), and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected after washing, with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution; HUABIO, Hangzhou, China) in blocking buffer for time period of 1 h. Immobilized conjugates were visualized on membranes in HRP substrate solution (Tiangen, Beijing, China). GAPDH monoclonal antibody was used as control (Transgene Biotech).
The purification of anti-Bmp38, anti-BmS6k serum, and preimmune serum was performed by the precipitation of ammonium sulfate according to previous method , Zhan et al. 2016 . Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford reagent (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). Western blotting showed that Bmp38 and BmS6K can be recognized by anti-Bmp38 and BmS6K serum. For further analysis, the efficacy of Bmp38 and BmS6K on BmNPV, anti-Bmp38/anti-BmS6K serum (0.5 mg/ml-5 µg/larvae), and preimmune serum (0.5 mg/ml-5 µg/larvae) was administered (injection) to abdomen of the first day of fifth instar of B. mori larvae. After 30 min, 10 microliters of BmNPV (BVs) suspended in water (1 × 10 5 /ml) was administrated per os. All the experiments were performed in biological triplicates. Midgut tissues were obtained at 48 h postinfection of BmNPV. Using genomic DNA extraction kit, the isolation of genomic DNA was performed (TaKaRa). Three BmNPV GP41, IE-1, and GP64 genes were analyzed in B. mori midgut by RT-qPCR.
To investigate the BmNPV infection characterization in silkworm, we monitored the dynamic proliferation of BmNPV in the midgut of the B. mori-resistant BC9 and -susceptible P50 strains by RT-qPCR.
Melting curve analysis confirmed that specific amplification was achieved using a pair of primers against the BmNPV GP41 gene. In the early stage after BmNPV infection (0-6 h), BmNPV proliferation was nearly undetected in the midgut-hypodermic injection and midgut-oral infection (Fig. 1) . As the infection progressed, BmNPV copy numbers increased significantly from 13.9 to 1,746.7 within 6-48 h in the susceptible P50 midgut injected. In contrast, the BmNPV proliferation rate was low in the resistant BC9 midgut injected, which slowly increased to 683.2 at 48 hpi and 11,210.8 at 72 hpi. In the midgut oral, the relative copy numbers of GP41 showed a similar pattern. The BmNPV copy numbers increased from 82.2 to 8,178.0 within 6-48 hpi in the susceptible P50. However, in resistant BC9, BmNPV proliferation was significantly slower with the relative copy number increasing from 6.5 to 2,216.2 within 6-48 hpi (Fig. 1) . These results indicated that viral proliferation was faster in midgut oral than in midgut injected. In addition, we also found that 48 hpi was critical time point when BmNPV copy numbers showed a significant difference between resistant strain BC9 and susceptible stain P50. Identification of Bmp38 and BmS6K, and Bioinformatics Analysis
The Bmp38 (GenBank NM_001043531.1) and BmS6K (GenBank NM_001202528.1) were identified from transcriptome database of B. mori (Wang et al. 2016 were identified at positions 20-304, with 3 N-glycosylation and 14 ubiquitination sites (Fig. 2A) . The BmS6K cDNA contains 2,262 bp ORF encoding 753 amino acids with calculated MW of 84.5 kDa and IP of 6.45. No UTR was found in BmS6K cDNA sequence. Two S_TKc domains along with extension to Ser/Thr-type protein kinases domain (S_TK_x) were predicted in BmS6K amino acid sequence, with 3 N-glycosylation and 39 ubiquitination sites (Fig. 2B) . Multiple sequence alignment of Bmp38 and BmS6K with proteins of other organisms showed that Bmp38 and BmS6K include an activation loop, a conserved Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) and Thr-Leu-Tyr (TLY) phosphorylation motifs, respectively. Bmp38 has an ED site and a substrate-binding site. Pairwise sequence analysis of Bmp38 protein sequence shows 84.8, 91.2, 98.3, and 70.3% similarity with Drosophila melanogaster, Nasonia vitripennis, Danaus plexippus plexippus, and Homo sapiens, respectively. Similarly, the BS6K protein sequence shows 58.9, 91.5, 94.5, and 85.9% similarity with D. melanogaster, Pieris rapae, Spodoptera litura, and Papilio machaon (Fig. 3A-C) .
To explore the evolutionary relationship of Bmp38 and BmS6K, a phylogenic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method from p38 and S6K proteins of different species. The phylogenetic tree can be classified into vertebrates and invertebrates. Bmp38 was closely related to Chilo suppressalis and D. plexippus, and BmS6K protein showed close relationship with S. litura and P. rapae ( Fig. 3B and C) . Based on iTRAQ database, Bmp38 and BmS6K were identified as differentially expressed proteins in different silkworm strains P50 (susceptible strain) and BC9 (resistant strain) according to iTRAQ database (Yu et al. 2017b ). Based on iTRAQ database, Bmp38 and BmS6K expressions were upregulated in P50+ and BC9+ infected with BmNPV than P50− and BC9− noninfected. The expression of both proteins was upregulated in resistant strain of silkworm BC9 after BmNPV infection data obtained from iTRAQ database (Table 2) .
To analyze the physiological function of Bmp38 and BmS6K proteins, recombinant His-tagged Bmp38 and BmS6K were expressed using prokaryotic expression system. The recombinant proteins (Bmp38 and BmS6K) were successfully expressed and detected by SDS-PAGE with molecular mass of approximately 35kDa and 30kDa, respectively (Fig. 4A-C) . The recombinant proteins were purified under denaturing conditions by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA column (Fig. 4B-D) , and recombinant proteins were confirmed through western blotting (Fig. 5) . For preparation of antibody, purified proteins were utilized. The titer of antibody was 1:60,000 approximately as per ELISA determination. 
To analysis tissue distribution of Bmp38 and BmS6K, different tissues including hemolymph, fat body, integument, head, midgut, and silk gland were collected for P50 and BC9 at 72 h after BmNPV challenge. After this, the RT-qPCR and western blot were performed. The Bmp38 was consecutively expressed in every tissue examined, with higher expression in the midgut, followed by the hemolymph. Furthermore, the Bmp38 expression levels in P50 (susceptible strain) and BC9 (resistant strain) were upregulated in the midgut, silk gland, integument, and hemolymph after BmNPV infection, whereas its expression level was downregulated in the fat body and head for P50 and was upregulated for BC9 after BmNPV infection (Fig. 6A) . Western blot results also showed that Bmp38 expression was relatively higher in the midgut, hemolymph, and fat body, which also validated our RT-qPCR results. However, no obvious hybrid band for Bmp38 was detected in the integument according to western blotting (Fig. 6B) . The RT-qPCR results indicated that BmS6K showed a different expression pattern with Bmp38. The BmS6K expression was also observed in every tissue examined, with the highest expression level in the hemolymph and midgut. The lowest expression was observed in the silk gland. Interestingly, unlike Bmp38, the expression between P50 (susceptible strain) and BC9 (resistant strain) of BmS6K was similar in the hemolymph and midgut, which was upregulated in P50 and BC9 after BmNPV infection. BmS6K expression level was downregulated in the head after BmNPV infection (Fig. 6C) . The translation level of BmS6K exposed that BmS6K had comparatively higher expression levels in the head, followed by the fat body. The translation data confirmed that BC9 had higher expression than P50 in the fat body after BmNPV infection (Fig. 6D ).
To evaluate iTRAQ database, we obtained the expression profile of Bmp38 and BmS6K in the midgut infected with BmNPV, and results were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The RT-qPCR results of Bmp38 indicated that its expression was upregulated in infected group (P50+ and BC9+) than control group (P50− and BC9−). When compared between P50 (susceptible strain) and BC9 (resistant strain), we observed that Bmp38 expression was higher in BC9 more than P50 at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h (Fig. 7A ). In addition, western blot results showed that Bmp38 translation profile is correlated with Bmp38 transcription profile (Fig. 7B) .
In case of BmS6K, the expression was upregulated in infected group (P50+ and BC9+) than control group (P50− and BC9−). However, BC9 expression was slightly increased at 6 h, then dramatically increased at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h than P50 after BmNPV infection (Fig. 7C) . The western blot analysis also confirmed that the expression of BmS6K was upregulated after BmNPV infection (Fig. 7D ).
The translation and transcription profiles of Bmp38 and BmS6K exposed that their expression was higher in BC9 (resistant strain). Next, we analyzed the effect of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 through blocking with antibody on virus proliferation. We injected anti-Bmp38/anti-BmS6K serum, preimmune serum, and CK to silkworm (B. mori). After 30 min, BmNPV (1 × 10 5 /ml) suspension per os was orally administered. RT-qPCR was performed to analysis the relative copy number of viral genes GP41, IE-1, and GP64. The results indicated that after blocking of Bmp38 with anti-Bmp38, relative copy number of viral genes were upregulated than preimmune serum and CK (Fig. 8A) . However, blocking of BmS6K with anti-BmS6K showed that relative copy number of viral genes was significantly upregulated than CK, but significantly downregulated than preimmune serum (Fig. 8B ).
MAPK signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved Ser-Thr kinases with a wide range of biological functions. MAPKs consist of three subfamilies including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK (Johnson and Lapadat 2002 , Roux and Blenis 2004 , Huang et al. 2009 ). The activation of MAPKs depends on phosphorylation of certain motifs found in activation loop. The p38 MAPK and S6K are important proteins of MAPK family. Evidence showed that p38 MAPK and S6K play vital role in both vertebrates and invertebrates (Roux and Blenis 2004, Fenton and Gout 2011) . However, studies on p38 and S6K MAPK proteins in silkworm had not been reported previously. Therefore, in the present study, we identified B. mori p38 and S6K proteins from iTRAQ database. The sequence analysis showed that Bmp38 and BmS6K contain S_TKc domain with 360 aa and 753 aa, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment of Bmp38 and BmS6k with other organisms (having known functions) revealed common features in all of them, e.g., activation loop and motifs. The phylogenetic analysis provided evidences that Bmp38 and BmS6K homologous are highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates. This phylogenetic analysis is consistent with the previous studies (Lin et al. 2017 , Yu et al. 2017c .
Previous reports indicate that p38 MAPK signaling involved in the cellular immune responses in mammals (Hoefen and Berk 2002) . In Drosophila, the p38 MAPK participate in host defense and protect Drosophila form injury caused by pathogens (Chen et al. 2010) . A p38 MAPK from Litopenaeus vannamei gene expression showed upregulation when challenged with pathogens (Yan et al. 2013) . Studies have shown that p38 MAPK participates in viral replication in in vito (Johnson et al. 2000, Khatri and Sharma 2006) . In this study, to determine Bmp38 can participate in immune response of B. mori, we analyzed Bmp38 expression after BmNPV infection.
Our study results showed that Bmp38 expression was higher in the midgut, followed by the hemolymph after BmNPV infection. The Data were normalized using BmGAPDH and represented as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt method. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. The significant difference was indicated by *P < 0.05 or **P < 0.01. Immunoblotting results of Bmp38 (B) and BmS6K (D) in the different tissues of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection for 72 h. GAPDH antibody was used as control. Fig. 7 . Relative expression level of Bmp38 (A) and BmS6K (C) in the midgut of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection for 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Data were normalized using BmGAPDH and represented as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt method. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. The significant difference was indicated by *P < 0.05 or **P < 0.01. Immunoblotting results of Bmp38 (B) and BmS6K (D) in the midgut of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection for 24, 48, and 72 h. GAPDH antibody was used as control.
expression in different silkworm strains showed that Bmp38 expression was upregulated in BC9 (resistant strain) than P50 (susceptible strain). The translation data confirmed that Bmp38 expression was higher in the BC9 than in the P50. We also observed the expression of Bmp38 in the midgut post-BmNPV infection. The results showed that Bmp38 expression was upregulated in P50+ and BC9+ than control. Moreover, expression in the BC9 was higher than P50 after BmNPV infection. Immunoblot results confirmed that Bmp38 expression was higher in the BC9 than in the P50. These findings are in accordance with our previous iTRAQ database (Yu et al. 2017b) . Similar evidence from different organisms showed p38 MAPK signaling pathway mRNA expression was increased after pathogen infection (He et al. , 2018 Yan et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2014) . A p38 protein from Scylla paramamosain showed that it is involved in immune response against bacteria and virus (Yu et al. 2017c ). These findings suggest that Bmp38 may be involved in immune response against BmNPV.
Ribosomal S6 kinase is a central component in the TOR pathway to regulate cell growth and energy metabolism in animals (Fenton and Gout 2011) . The study on S6K in Drosophila suggests that disruption of S6K cause the death of flies at the larvae and pupa stage (Montagne et al. 1999) . To date, there are no reports on S6K functions against pathogens. We observed the transcription and translation level of B. mori S6K. Our results showed that BmS6K expression was higher in the hemolymph and midgut after BmNPV infection. The translation results showed that BmS6K expression was higher in the head, followed by the fat body. The transcription results of BmS6K in the midgut after BmNPV infection revealed that BmS6K expression was at peak at 12 h postinfection, then its expression decreased slightly at 24, 48, and 72 h, but it was still significantly upregulated. The translation data also correlate with the transcription data. Moreover, we found that BmS6K translation data are somewhat consistent with the iTRAQ and need further attention.
For further confirmation of Bmp38 and BmS6K role in silkworm against BmNPV infection, we used BC9 (resistant strain) and blocked the proteins with corresponding antibodies. The results indicated that Bmp38 blocking increased the relative copy numbers of viral genes when compared with control. It has been reported that silence of p38 from Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) revealed its role against white spot syndrome virus (He et al. 2018) . Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 affected the replication of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (Marchant et al. 2010) . Therefore, we speculated that Bmp38 might be involved in BmNPV resistance. The RSK family comprised a group of highly related serine/threonine kinases that regulated diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, cell growth, and motility. Members of RSK family contained RSK1, RSK2, RSK3, and RSK4. Among them, activated RSK2 was shown to phosphorylate several transcription factors response to viral infection (Yan et al. 2018) . Surviladze et al. (2013) revealed that activation of PI3K/Akt/ mTOR could phosphorylate S6K to further activate the downstream signal pathways in response to human papillomavirus type 16 infection. In case of BmS6K, the relative copy numbers of viral genes were significantly upregulated than CK. We considered that BmNPV resistance of BmS6K required phosphorylation modification. Therefore, the specific reasons need to be conducted. The abovementioned results suggested that blocking of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 (resistant strain) might participate in BmNPV proliferation.
In summary, the p38 and S6K proteins from B. mori were characterized for the first time. The expression profiles of Bmp38 and BmS6K showed that they might play vital role in silkworm against BmNPV infection. The study presented here would enhance further investigation of silkworm immune defense against BmNPV infection. Fig. 8 .

88,15f99a27eec125edd5f2c431344f01883ff72129,"The past decade and a half has been characterized by numerous emerging infectious diseases. With each new threat, there has been a call for rapid vaccine development. Pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Zika virus represent either new viral entities or viruses emergent in new geographic locales and characterized by novel complications. Both serve as paradigms for the global spread that can accompany new pathogens. In this paper, we review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and Zika virus with respect to vaccine development. The challenges in vaccine development and the approach to clinical trial design to test vaccine candidates for disease entities with a changing epidemiology are discussed.
In 2012, cases of a progressive pulmonary infection related to individuals who reside in or traveled to the Arabian Peninsula were determined as caused by a novel Group C, b-coronavirus MERS-CoV. 1,2 In contrast to the majority of human pathogenic coronaviruses that cause self-limited upper-respiratory illness, the mortality rate of early MERS-CoV cases was approximately 60%, 3 and has remained greater than 35% -approximating that seen during the West African Ebola virus outbreak. In contrast, the mortality rate during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic was 10%.
Following an incubation period of about 1 week, MERS-CoV causes a rapidly progressive lower respiratory infection with a prodromal illness characterized by fever, cough, and mild shortness of breath. Clinical deterioration is typical leading to the need for intensive care and ventilator support","The past decade and a half has been punctuated by multiple global infectious threats ( Table 1) . Epidemics of new influenza variants, novel coronaviruses and enteroviruses, new strains of Ebola virus, and the emergence of Zika virus and Chikungunya in regions of the world previously unaffected has created significant concerns in healthcare about minimizing the time from identification to disease control. Globalization of tourism and business have further complicated disease epidemiology that may have once been more localized but now poses greater potential for international spread.
The approach to emerging infectious disease (EID) mitigation differs based on the respective pathogen. For example, the recent H3N2 and H7N9 outbreaks were associated with porcine and avian exposure as a risk for infection. Additionally, introduction of a pathogen into new regions may alter the epidemiology of disease. Although Ebola virus outbreaks occurred sporadically since 1976, its appearance in the major population centers of West Africa resulted in a significant amplification of transmission not seen with the prior, geographically limited outbreaks. The Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) represented a new viral entity, related to other minimally pathogenic coronaviruses but causing a highly lethal syndrome. And whereas, Zika virus had been recognized in African and East Asia for almost 6 decades, its emergence into the Western hemisphere and the recognition of heretofore unrecognized complications including congenital microcephaly and Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS).
Vaccines are considered as a critical component of disease prevention for EIDs, especially since in some cases treatment options are limited or non-existent, or rapid clinical deterioration may limit the effectiveness of therapeutics. However, for EID vaccine development the desire for rapid deployment of vaccines for newly emergent diseases is tempered by the realities of the life-cycle for drug development.
In this paper, we review the epidemiology and clinical presentation of MERS-CoV and Zika virus with regard to vaccine development. In particular, the challenges in clinical trial design of efficacy studies are considered and discussed -in particular for diseases that may be limited in scope and/or for which the epidemiology is changing in real-time.
within days of presentation to hospital. 4, 5 Complications of MERS-CoV include renal failure and cardiac arrhythmias.
The MERS-CoV epidemic has been punctuated by large healthcare associated [6] [7] [8] [9] and dialysis unit 10 outbreaks. Personto-person spread between family members, while documented, 11 represents a small minority of transmission events. Contact with camels is considered a significant risk for infection, 12 and while direct evidence of camel-to-human transmission has been reported 13 others have questioned the certainty of direct transmission suggested by this report. 14 For most cases, sources of infection are unknown. 15 Humans have served as the vector for global spread of MERS. Cases across Europe, North America, and Asia have emanated from travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, the UAE, and Kuwait. 3, 16, 17 Secondary infections were infrequently reported in early travel-associated cases. 5 However, the global epidemic potential for MERS-CoV was exemplified by the fact that a businessman returning from the Middle East to Seoul Korea served as the index case for 185 subsequent cases of MERS-CoV with a 20% mortality rate despite early diagnosis and intensive supportive care. The latter outbreak was in large part due to a breakdown in basic infection control. 9, 18 Further spread beyond the Arabian peninsula appears to have been avoided through active screening and quarantine of returning travelers.
Similar to SARS-CoV, a Group B b coronavirus, MERS-CoV is considered to be of bat origin. Phylogenetic analysis of the MERS-CoV ORF1 maps the MERS/EMC2012 strain to Group C node strains that includes the Tyloncyteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and the Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5. 19 Analysis of samples taken from 96 bats in proximity to a MERS-CoV case in Saudi Arabia detected sequences that had 100% nucleotide identity to the RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain from fecal material for one animal. 20 MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl dipeptidase 4 (DPP4) as its cell surface receptor. 21 However, while HKU4 and HKU5 are highly homologous to MERS-CoV, only HKU4 utilizes DPP4 for cell entry. Moreover, HKU4 prefers bat DPP4 over human DPP4 whereas the opposite is true for MERS-CoV. 22, 23 Thus, whereas SARS-CoV utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor, conserved across mammalian species, 24 MERS-CoV binds to a genetic variant of DPP4 with analogs expressed only in humans, non-human primates, bats, and camelids. 25, 26 The emergence of MERS-CoV as a novel human pathogen has 2 remaining mysteries. First, the genetic alterations that have allowed a virus such as HKU4 that causes a mild, self-limited upper respiratory infection to become a lower respiratory pathogen of high mortality is unknown. And second, since MERS-CoV inefficiently utilizes bat DPP4 for cell entry it should have limited ability to persist in this animal. As discussed below, camels are efficient carriers of MERS-CoV. Whether early transfer to camels occurred that provided the necessary reservoir and amplification is unknown.
For the large fraction of cases, camels serve as a primary source of infection. Greater than 90% of dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula [27] [28] [29] [30] and North Africa 31 are seropositive or actively shedding virus -that suggests a high level of susceptibility to infection. Camels develop a self-limited upper respiratory infection marked by high viral excretion that can exceed 10 7 PFU/ml. 32 Other camelids can serve as natural hosts. Alpacas housed in proximity to camels have high seropositivity rates 33 demonstrating the opportunity for additional reservoirs of infection. The global trade in exotic animals such as palm civets served as the vector for transmission of SARS-CoV 34 and should provide caution regarding animal-related spread of MERS-CoV.
Phylogenetic species restriction of susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection has severely limited development of animal models of disease. Primates, including rhesus macaques and marmosets, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4, camelids, and rabbits have been assessed as potential animal models, 35 however, each model system has limitations. Rhesus macaques develop transient pulmonary infection and illness. 36, 37 Whereas marmosets develop more severe illness following MERS-CoV infection, 38 some have questioned whether the observed pathology is related to experimental manipulation of this small mammal versus the effects of viral infection. 39 Transgenic mice that constitutively express human DPP4 develop lethal systemic infection, including central nervous system disease [40] [41] [42] whereas transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 driven from surfactant promoters 43 or transduced with adenoviral-associated vectors that express human DPP4 44 develop mild, transient disease. While camels and alpacas are natural hosts for MERS-CoV infection and have been used as disease models, 45 they develop a self-limited upper respiratory infection different from human infection. 32 Moreover, there is considerable expense and difficulty of experimental models using large animals.
The magnitude of MERS-CoV viral load in nasopharyngeal secretions 46 and blood 47 has been directly correlated with higher mortality in some studies. The utility of upper respiratory samples is, however, not clear since MERS-CoV is a lower respiratory tract pathogen and the viral load in lower respiratory samples has minimal correlation to the risk of death. 48 There remains a dearth of studies on the immunology of MERS-CoV infection, with even less information that compares cohorts of both MERS-CoV survivors and non-survivors, nor is there a significant literature regarding SARS-CoV immunology that may serve as a paradigm. For SARS-CoV, B cell immunity was shown to be short-lived with antibodies undetectable in up to 90% of survivors by 24 months 49,50 whereas in contrast, T-cell responses were long-lived and persistent to at least 6 y. 49 Importantly, mouse studies demonstrated that cytotoxic T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV was required for viral clearance and survival from lethal infection. 51, 52 The kinetics of the serologic response against MERS-CoV shows that binding and neutralizing antibodies appear at about day 10 of illness, reaching a peak a few days later. 53 A small Saudi Arabian study of 7 MERS-CoV survivors demonstrated persistence of neutralizing antibodies for almost 3 y. 54 The role of neutralizing antibodies in viral clearance is, however, not clear. A Korean study of 17 patients showed no clear difference in the pattern or timing of binding antibody development between those with severe vs. non-severe disease, whereas appearance of neutralizing antibodies was delayed by a few days in those with severe disease but once apparent, reached titers 1:320 more rapidly. 53 Notably only 2 patients (1 with severe and 1 with non-severe disease) did not develop neutralizing antibodies greater than 1:20. A study of 37 persons from Saudi Arabia found that 24 of 27 (89%) of all patients with complete data demonstrated binding and neutralizing antibodies. 48 Pairwise correlation found no association between the presence of neutralizing antibodies and viral clearance. Thus, the role for neutralizing antibodies in MERS-CoV disease outcomes is not established.
Finally, one could question whether subclinical or non-lethal infection provides long-term protective immunity against recurrent MERS-CoV infection. Considering the fact that camels have high sero-prevalence of MERS-CoV, it would be expected that camel workers would have recurrent MERS-CoV exposure. Yet, 2 large seroepidemiologic surveys of camel workers in Saudi Arabia found a low prevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies 55, 56 suggesting that antibodies may in fact not be persistent. Moreover, the fact that many with camel exposure continue to present with MERS-CoV infection also suggests that prior exposures may not provide long-term immunity.
In the fall and early winter of 2015, international symposia on vaccine and drug development against MERS-CoV were held in Seoul Korea, Riyadh Saudi Arabia, and Geneva Switzerland. 57,58 MERS-CoV vaccines that were discussed include viral vectored, protein subunit and nanoparticle, and plasmid DNA vaccines -all directed against the S (envelope) protein or the DPP4 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Viral vectored vaccine candidates include adenoviral associated vectors based on chimpanzee serotype 1 and human serotype 5 59 ; poxvirus vectors based on the modified vaccinia Ankara strain 60 ; and an attenuated measles virus vector. 61 Protein based vaccines included both RBD subunit vaccine 62-64,62,63 and a trimeric, full-length S protein nanoparticle. 65, 66 Sequence engineering of the RBD subunit has allowed production of vaccine candidates with »3-fold greater microneutralization titers. 64 DNA vaccines include DNA-prime / protein-boost based on a wild-type full-length S protein and S1 protein boost, respectively 37 ; a second DNA vaccine encoding for a consensus S protein 36 ; and 2 groups that assessed variable wild-type S protein constructs. 67, 68 Work has shown that inclusion of the full cytoplasmic domain and transmembrane domain into DNA constructs is critical for immunogenicity 67,68 with increased immunogenicity and balanced IgG1/IgG2 ratio for an S1 subunit vaccine vs. the full length S construct that was weighted toward an IgG2 response. 68 Only one DNA vaccine, GLS-5300, has progressed into human clinical trials (NCT02670187, Table 2 ). An on-going listing of vaccines is also published by the World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/immuniza tion/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/.
With a paucity of immunologic studies for either the SARS or MERS coronaviruses, one can speculate as to the properties that an ideal MERS-CoV vaccine should possess. The lack of an ideal animal model for MERS-CoV has served as a further impediment in vaccine development. The need for a robust cytotoxic T-cell response for survival and viral clearance is Clinical Trials Gov designation. 3 Date entered into Clinical Trials Gov. 4 GLS-5300 is being co-developed by GeneOne Life Science, Inc. and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 5 The indicated studies have completed enrollment.

suggested from animal models of SARS-CoV and studies of SARS survivors. The limited data of MERS-CoV recovered patients shows that an early binding antibody response may be beneficial whereas the role of neutralizing antibodies is unclear.
The role of cellular immune responses for MERS-CoV and the relative importance of the humoral and cellular immunity to prevent infection is not yet characterized.
Phase I studies of a synthetic, consensus DNA plasmid vaccine A single MERS-CoV vaccine candidate, full-length S protein consensus DNA vaccine GLS-5300, has progressed to human clinical trials ( Table 2) . A total of 75 participants were assigned to one of 3 dose levels: 0.67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg administered on day 0, week 4, and week 12 via intramuscular (IM) injection and followed by electroporation (EP). Additional studies to assess the relative immunogenicity of intradermal (ID) vaccine administration and followed by EP will provide details as to optimal vaccine dosing.
Design and conduct of an efficacy trial for MERS-CoV may be a daunting task as the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is vastly different from the start of the outbreak in 2012 -with fewer cases, that are scattered across Saudi Arabia. Except for a single large outbreak in Seoul Korea, there has been minimal transmission of MERS-CoV outside of Saudi Arabia. While MERS-CoV remains endemic in Saudi Arabia with approximately 20-30 cases diagnosed monthly, vigilance in maintaining strict infection control procedures has significantly reduced new cases among healthcare workers (HCWs) and spread to patients in healthcare facilities. Nor have there been additional outbreaks outside of the Arabian Peninsula akin to the Korean epidemic of September 2015. Additionally, many incident infections occur in individuals without a clear epidemiologic link to a known case or to camels. All of these factors create challenges in the design of a definitive efficacy trial for any MERS-CoV vaccine.
Basic protocol designs include ring vaccination studies to prevent infection among direct contacts and studies to prevent incident infection groups at highest risk for MERS-CoV infection. Ring vaccination was successfully used in the Ebola epidemic, 69 made possible by the fact that family and healthcare contacts were at high risk for infection. Transmission of MERS-CoV within family units has been documented, 11 however, such cases appear to be more of an anomaly. In healthcare settings, infection control measures have significantly reduced spread between patients and to HCWs. Thus, a ring-vaccination strategy would require the enrollment of a large number of recruited families and contacts to reach a sufficient number of events to achieve statistical power.
A second study design is of population-based vaccination for those at highest risk for infection: HCWs, residents in towns and villages with the highest historical case rates, and those with camel contact. A key challenge is how to best identify those with past MERS-CoV exposure, and, of this group, to determine which individuals may have pre-existent protective B cell and/or T cell immunity. Whether any vaccine study should be restricted to non-immune individuals is an interesting question since it has already been demonstrated that a minority of individuals with repeated exposure to camels have detectable antibodies, suggesting that immunity may not be persistent. 55, 56 And the fact that camel exposure continues as a known risk for infection, further raises the question of whether non-lethal infection results in protective immunity and again, whether such immunity is persistent. Thus, studies in riskgroups could be stratified between those with or without documented MERS-CoV immune responses. Whether exposure should be defined by epidemiologic exposure or the presence of binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, or T cell responses is also unknown.
Finally, a third clinical trial design could focus on those at highest risk for severe infection. Such a study would more easily discern vaccine effectiveness since the primary outcome would compare morbidity and death between vaccine and placebo. However, those at highest risk for severe disease including the elderly and those with underlying illness such as cardiac, pulmonary, and renal disease, 4,70 may limit vaccine immune responsiveness.
Any MERS-CoV vaccine has a key challenge as to the ability to conduct a definitive efficacy trial. The decrease in incident cases overall and the fact that primary cases are geographically separated are the 2 primary factors making such a trial difficult. An efficacy trial to prevent primary infection may be possible if restricted to on Saudi villages and towns with the greatest number of known cases. And since ongoing nosocomial spread is still documented, including a small outbreak in June 2017, a study to prevent infection in health care workers may be feasible. There is interest in a MERS-CoV camel vaccine that may both limit human disease and provide an alternative path to licensure via the animal rule, although vaccine development in camels presents its own unique challenges. As indicated by the epidemiology of infection, a MERS-CoV vaccine would primarily target the population in endemic countries, especially those in the health-care industry and those with contact with camels. Secondary markets exist for those traveling to (or from) the Arabian Peninsula, perhaps including those making pilgrimage to the Hajj and as a stockpile by governments against future outbreaks.
Zika virus is a member of the flavivirus family that includes dengue, West Nile, and Yellow Fever viruses. Zika virus was discovered in 1947 as part of a study to map the geographic extent of Yellow Fever virus in Uganda. At the time of discovery, Zika was prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia with seroprevalence rates as high as 60% in some regions. [71] [72] [73] [74] Except for a small outbreak on Yap Island in 2009, 75 Zika virus remained essentially unknown outside of Africa and Asia until 2014.
In 2014, a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia lasting only 4 months resulted in approximately 9,000 diagnosed cases, 30,000 with consistent symptoms, and an estimated 60% of island residents infected. 76, 77 Zika virus quickly spread eastward across the South Pacific 78 with the first cases documented in Brazil in early 2015. 79, 80 Interestingly, some reports have suggested that the Zika epidemic in Brazil may have started as early as 2012. 81 Aedes species mosquitoes, and in particular Ae. aegypti, represent the dominant vector for transmission of Zika virus. [82] [83] [84] [85] While other mosquito species may harbor Zika virus, 82 they may not be able to transmit infection. 86 Aedes albopticus, a more temperate species, can both carry Zika virus and transmit infection. 87 Zika is transmitted transovarially, i.e. vertically across mosquito generations. 88 Sexual transmission of Zika virus has been well documented with Zika persisting in seminal fluid for up to 10 weeks following infection. [89] [90] [91] Zika is also detected in saliva, breast milk, and tears. 92, 93 Zika virus infection is typically self-limited, with many cases minimally symptomatic. After an estimated 5-7 day incubation period, a viral prodrome of generalized achiness, myalgias, arthralgia, sore throat, and headache may be followed by a generalized maculopapular rash that involves the palms and soles. 94 Retro-orbital pain and conjunctivitis is common; fever, if present, is usually low-grade.
Complications of Zika virus infection can be divided into neurologic and genitourinary. Zika virus is neurotropic, a link made as early as 1971 in mice. 95 In adults, Zika virus can cause Guillain-Barr e syndrome (GBS) with an attack rate estimated as almost 1 in 5,000 cases of infection. 96 Unlike classical GBS following by Campylobacter gastroenteritis, only a fraction (»30%) of patients presenting with Zika-induced GBS had circulating anti-ganglioside autoantibodies and did not have a consistent pattern of expressed autoantibodies. 96 Other complications include encephalitis, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and seizures. 77, 97, 98 Women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy are at risk for fetal infection. The association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly was first reported in Pernambuco state Brazil in November 2015. 99 The perceived absence of microcephaly during the French Polynesian outbreak was resolved when a retrospective study found a prevalence of microcephaly of 1-2% for infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy. 100 However, a recent study has estimated that up to 30% of infants of women infected at the end of the 1 st trimester may be affected. 101 Additional aspects of congenital Zika virus infection include intracranial calcifications, ocular calcifications, retinal defects, auditory defects, and arthrogryposis. 100,102-105 Some pregnant women develop prolonged Zika viremia, that resolves only with delivery of the infant. 102, [106] [107] [108] Genitourinary complications for Zika virus are just beginning to be understood. As noted above, Zika can be detected in seminal fluid for prolonged periods following infection. A more ominous complication in mice, but not yet documented for humans, is that infection in young mice causes direct testicular infection that results in testicular atrophy and infertility. 109 
Prior to mid-2016, diagnostic testing for Zika virus infection was non-existent outside of academic laboratories. Since that time, multiple PCR and serologic assays have gained Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Diagnosis of Zika virus infection remains complicated by epitope cross-reactivity between Zika virus and other flaviviruses that affects serologic assays, 110 the relative paucity of symptoms that may delay sample collection for PCR-based assays coupled with the relatively short period of viremia and the need to detect virus in other body fluids such as urine and/or semen. 111 For a review of the subject the reader is referred elsewhere. 112 Clinical studies have demonstrated marked variation in the sensitivity of detection for different test methods 113 raising a cautionary note.
Viral detection by PCR is the mainstay for diagnosis and is considered the ""gold standard"" to determine acute illness in clinical trials. Zika virus viremia typically lasts 1-2 weeks whereas Zika can be detected in the urine for up to 4 weeks, 113, 114 and even longer in the semen. 91, 115 Serology detection of Zika virus infection has targeted either the viral envelope, NS1 protein, or incorporates a whole virus assay. Using an NS1 assay, Jeong et al. determined the kinetics of antibody formation for 8 persons with travel-related Zika virus infection. 113 IgM responses were present within a few days of presentation and persisted for up to 35-40 days; IgG responses were detectable approximately 10 d post-presentation and persisted for the length of the study 113 consistent with a prior small study. 116 Zika is uniquely able to suppress the human innate immune response. Zika has been demonstrated to downregulate type 1 interferon (IFN) response of dendritic cells through impairment of phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 117 with others finding that the Zika virus non-structural 5 (NS5) protein results in proteasomal degradation of STAT2 in 293T cells 118 -the latter phenomenon also seen with dengue virus. 118 In contrast to humans, the Zika NS5 does not affect murine STAT2 function, such that Rag I ¡/¡ mice, lacking mature T and B cell cells, remain resistant to Zika virus infection. 119 Additionally, wild-type mice whose innate immune system is impaired by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the type I IFN receptors are similarly resistant to Zika virus. 119 In contrast, Rag I ¡/¡ mice treated with type I IFN receptor mAbs developed neurologic and testicular infection. 119 Thus for humans, since Zika can downregulate the innate immune system, a vaccine that can induce an adaptive immune response gains importance especially with regard to neurologic and testicular infection. Zika virus has also been shown to be able to evade the immune system despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Macaques will rapidly resolve viremia following experimental infection that correlates with the onset of antibody formation and cell mediated immunity. 120 However despite the presence of neutralizing and binding antibodies and induction of CD4C and CD8C immune responses, Zika persists in the lymph nodes and central nervous system for 1.5 to 2.5 months. 120 Notably, CNS infection of the macaques was associated with transcriptomic evidence of upregulation of mTOR and other inflammatory pathways 120 -a key pathway that is dysregulated by the Zika NS4A and NS4B proteins increasing autophagy of neural progenitor cells. 121 These data would suggest that it is important to prevent infection before establishment of persistence in protected sites.
The question of whether prior immunity against DENV can provide cross protection against Zika virus or enhance Zika virus infection is not yet resolved. For DENV, heterologous secondary infection, i.e., with a different serotype approximately 2 y post-infection, carries an increased risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) whereas earlier exposures are protective. 122 Studies by Halstead demonstrated that the severity of secondary infection correlated with presence of non-neutralizing antibodies in sera that increase in vitro cellular viral entry 123 -a phenomenon termed antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. In one prospective study of Thai children, of serum collected in the 6 month period before secondary infection, sera from 4 (13%) of 32 children with asymptomatic secondary DENV infection demonstrated ADE vs. 6 of 9 (67%) with severe infection. 124 In contrast, 2 subsequent prospective Thai studies of greater than 200 children with secondary DENV infection did not demonstrate any relationship between severe infection and ADE. 125, 126 Henderson et al. in a primate study from 1970 demonstrated cross protection for animals infected with one flavivirus and challenged with a second, different flavivirus 127 whereas 2 later in vitro studies demonstrated antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection between the DENV and Yellow Fever flaviviruses. 128, 129 In vitro ADE has also been demonstrated for Zika virus by the presence of flavivirus antibodies against DENV and/or West Nile virus (WNV). [130] [131] [132] MAbs against the DENV fusion loop domain has lower affinity to Zika virus and induces ADE, 133 whereas mAbs against the envelope E1 domain inhibit ADE. 131 Others found that prior antibodies to the DENV serotype 1 envelope domain III were associated with higher Zika neutralizing titers. 134 In contrast to sera collected from subjects with acute DENV infection 131,133 sera collected later in the convalescent period did not demonstrate cross-reactivity between DENV and Zika virus. 135 Conversely antibodies against the Zika virus envelope domains I and II were poorly neutralizing and enhanced dengue virus infection whereas domain III antibodies were specific and protective. 132, 133, 136 Importantly, clinical correlates of cross-flavivirus ADE are so far lacking. A study of 131 PCR-positive pregnant women found no correlation (p D 0.667) between the presence of prior DENV antibodies and disease severity, and with no relationship between Zika viral load and adverse outcomes such as fetal loss. 137 Thus, the clinical implication of prior flavivirus immunity remains unanswered.
At present, correlates of protection that would relate to vaccine development have not been determined. The goal would be to prevent infection before establishment of viral reservoirs in the CNS, lymph nodes, or even testes. Induction of high levels of binding antibodies may be sufficient to prevent Zika induced immune dysregulation and viral clearance. And while the induction of neutralizing antibodies are considered by many as ideal, their limitation in being able to clear reservoirs in the CNS and lymph nodes 120 is cautionary. Finally, an ideal vaccine would also induce cellular immunity, especially CD8C T-cell responses as these may serve to prevent CNS and testicular damage despite dysregulation of the type I IFN pathways caused by the Zika NS1 protein.
A key target population for a Zika virus vaccine are women of childbearing potential with the goal prevent congenital Zika virus infection. Vaccination during pregnancy is, however, not a viable strategy even for a vaccine deemed safe. Since pregnancy may not be suspected until the mid to latter parts of the 1 st trimester, there may be insufficient time to develop protective immune responses before the risk to the fetus is greatest. Therefore, any vaccine program should target all post-pubertal females of child bearing potential and their male sexual partners. For males, the observation in mice that Zika can infect the testes causing atrophy and infertility, 109 raises the question of whether vaccination is warranted early in childhood.
Vaccine candidates in development include live-attenuated viral vaccines; live chimeric vaccines; purified inactivated (killed) vaccines (PIV); viral vectored vaccines based on measles, adeno-associated virus (AAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and vaccinia platforms; subunit and nanoparticle protein based vaccines; and nucleic acid vaccines using both DNA and mRNA approaches 138, 139 (see also the World Health Organization listing at http://www.who.int/immunization/research/ vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/). As of the date of this review, pre-clinical data for one PIV vaccine, an attenuated live-virus vaccine, 3 DNA vaccines, 2 mRNA vaccines, 2 separate AAV-based vaccine (Ad5 and Ad52), and a subunit vaccine have been published. [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] Three DNA vaccines, an mRNA vaccine, and a PIV vaccine have advanced into Phase I clinical trials ( Table 3) .
Correlates of protective immunity of a Zika vaccine is an area of intense study. Additionally, the relative importance of humoral and cellular immunity is as yet uncharacterized. Importantly, no standardized assay has been developed that correlates immune responses with outcomes.
While Zika virus transmission is ongoing in each of the affected countries in the Americas, incident cases have dramatically declined that presents a potential barrier for an efficacy trial. A correlate is that within endemic regions, many have already been infected that limits the numbers at risk. Thus, there has been a race to get any of the vaccine candidates into a region with active transmission. Two trials, DNA vaccine GLS-5700 and ZPIV, have begun enrollment in a Zika endemic region (Table 3) .
There are 2 unique safety considerations that have been raised in discussions of Zika virus vaccine development: antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) and GBS. ADE is an in vitro phenomenon initially documented for dengue virus 123,148 that has been observed for all flaviviruses including Zika. 129 While the presence of enhancing antibodies has been postulated as a risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), prospective clinical studies have not demonstrated a correlation between the presence of enhancing antibodies in pre-infection serum and more severe dengue virus infections. 125, 126 One caveat for a Zika vaccine is the finding that studies of a live-virus chimeric dengue vaccine, young children and dengue-seronegative adults were at greater risk for DHF starting 3 y post-vaccination. 149 As discussed above, clinical correlation of cross-flavivirus reactivity is as yet unresolved. There is no epidemiologic data to suggest that the current Zika virus epidemic has increased the risk for DHF and as presented above, one study in pregnant females showed no evidence of di",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ferences in disease severity related to prior DENV seropositivity 137 and other studies have shown that prior DENV serotype I infection may be associated with increased neutralizing antibody titers 134 that could result in greater protection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GBS as a complication of Zika virus infection is well documented in the French Polynesian, Brazilian, and American outbreaks. 77, [150] [151] [152] A study from French Polynesia showed that in contrast to classical cases of GBS, a minority of patients had detectable anti-ganglioside antibodies and when present there was no consistent pattern of autoantibodies. 96 To date, molecular mimics similar to that observed between the Campylobacter lipooligosaccharide and axonal gangliosides have not been documented for Zika.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In contrast to MERS, Zika remains endemic such that efficacy trials remain possible -the key challenge being the ability to move to Phase II/III before the disappearance of Zika from target regions. The fact that countries such as Brazil appear to be experiencing repeated cycles of infection 153 is promising for the conduct of such a trial. Zika vaccine development has been driven primarily from the desire to prevent congenital infection for women who become infected during pregnancy. Secondary targets are the prevention of other neurologic complications such as GBS and possibly the prevention of infection of males to prevent testicular damage. The primary target population of a vaccination program differs somewhat -females of childbearing potential and males from birth to the end of their childbearing years. The difference in ages between males and females relates to the current uncertainty in age when the testes are most prone to infection and the lack of evidence of direct infection of the ovaries. Pregnant women would not be considered a primary target population since initiating a vaccine series after pregnancy is diagnosed may induce protective immunity after the end of the 1 st trimester when the fetus is most at risk. Additionally, the safety of viral vectored and live-attenuated vaccines is unknown in pregnancy. Additional target populations are those traveling to endemic regions or those living in regions where Aedes species mosquitoes, especially Ae. aegypti, are endemic. An excellent source of information for Zika vaccine and therapeutic plans was published by the World Health Organization at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/ 250615/1/WHO-ZIKV-PHR-16.1-eng.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vaccine development for each infectious disease has unique challenges. 154 At the time of emergence, little may be known of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and the epidemic potential of a new infectious agent. MERS-CoV and Zika virus highlight the potential the emergence of future pathogens. MERS-CoV appears to represent a novel genetic variant of the minimally pathogenic HNK4 bat coronavirus, however, questions still remain as to why one strain has a mortality of 35-40% and causes lower respiratory disease while the other causes self-limited upper respiratory illness. Moreover, since MERS-CoV preferentially binds to human DPP4 why this likely variant of bat strain HKU4 (that prefers bat DPP4) would emerge and propagate within bats is also a mystery. For Zika virus, globalization has augmented spread of disease to a non-endemic region, however, the means of transmission is still unknown. Continued genetic modification of human and animal viruses will continue to pose potential threats as will spread of diseases from previously remote regions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For MERS-CoV, the discovery of a novel coronavirus in a single Saudi Arabian patient in 2012 2 caused concern but not alarm as the case appeared to be an isolated event. As case numbers both regionally and globally increased 155 and then quickly escalated,156, 157 concerns were heightened. However, appreciation of the potential global threat from this organism was delayed for about a year. Zika virus was a known entity at the time of reemergence in 2015, having been discovered almost 60 y before. Zika was previously considered to cause an illness similar to, but much less severe than either dengue or chikungunya. While there had been nascent efforts at developing a vaccine for Zika virus, the lack of known severe complications tempered research efforts. As noted above, it was only when Zika was associated with microcephaly and other congenital defects in the latter part of 2015 that provided the impetus to hasten vaccine discovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both diseases had the advantage of occurring at a time when multiple platform technologies were existent. 154 Many platforms could respond to a new pathogen after only minimal genetic modification. Experience has allowed more classical vaccines to also undergo rapid modification, although in some cases structural considerations (e.g., protein structure and antigen presentation) or unique adverse events (e.g., eosinophilc pulmonary inflammation induced by whole inactivated SARS virus vaccines at the time of viral challenge 158 ) were required.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As noted above, the response to both EIDs was robust, with many academic laboratories and pharmaceutical firms initiating vaccine programs. Both illnesses are characterized by a changing epidemiology such that the time that a vaccine candidate had entered into clinical trials, the incidence of disease had significantly declined. For MERS-CoV the current endemic rate of incident infections, with few cases in any one region creates significant challenges, i.e., potentially requiring a large number of participants to demonstrate efficacy. The regional restriction of MERS-CoV coupled with an approximate 200-250 cases per year limits the commercial potential of any vaccine -likely a key factor in only a single vaccine entering clinical trials. While a Zika virus vaccine has greater commercial potential, the rapid increase and decline epidemic of cases in affected regions requires prognostication of where cases will occur in the future rather than the present since there is at least a 6-month lead time for logistic preparation, country-specific regulatory approvals, and local review board approvals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Zika virus and MERS-CoV epidemics have required unique approaches to vaccine development. Both have promoted intense development efforts by numerous academic and commercial entities that have enabled rapid responses to the respective diseases. The challenges of these diseases and other EIDS pose unique challenges clinical trial design and vaccine development such that a comprehensive strategy, including adequate funding, is required to ensure that early enthusiasm and advancements of academic laboratories and many biotechnology companies continue through later development and do not wither on the vine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

89,bd667dbd5200c9f07fb07cef29435f7ca7c2639b,"Since there is no available serological methods to detect antibodies to ferret coronavirus (FRcoV), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant partial nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the ferret coronavirus (FRcoV) Yamaguchi-1 strain was developed to establish a serological method for detection of FRcoV infection. Many serum samples collected from ferrets recognized both a.a. 1-179 and a.a. 180-374 of the N protein, but two serum samples did not a.a. 180-374 of the N protein. This different reactivity was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the serum from the ferret.Therefore, the a.a. 1-179 of the N protein was used as an ELISA antigen. Serological test was carried out using sera or plasma of ferrets in Japan. Surprisingly, 89% ferrets in Japan had been infected with FRcoV. These results indicated that our established ELISA using a.a. 1-179 of the N protein is useful for detection of antibody to FRcoV for diagnosis and seroepidemiology of FRcoV infection. KEY WORDS: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ferret coronavirus (FRcoV), nucleocapsid (N)","Epizootic catarrhal enteritis (EcE), a new enteric disease of domestic ferrets (Mustelo putorius furo), was first described in the United States in the early 1990s [11] . A novel alphacoronavirus, ferret coronavirus (FRcoV), was detected as the causative agent of EcE in 2000 and designated as ferret enteric coronavirus (FREcV) [11, 12] . Ferrets with EcE show general clinical signs including lethargy, anorexia and vomiting, and characteristic signs with foul-smelling, green mucous-laden diarrhea [12] . FRcoV was also reported as the causative agent of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-like disease in 2006, and the virus was designated as ferret systemic coronavirus (FRScV) [2] [3] [4] . Ferrets with FIP-like disease show characteristic clinical signs of large palpable intraabdominal masses like dry type of FIP [2] [3] [4] . FRcoVs were divided into two genotypes, I and II, based on differences in the spike (S) gene, and it was suggested that genotype I was associated with FIP-like disease and genotype II was with EcE [13] . However, we previously showed that there was no significant relationship between the genotypes of FRCoV and disease in Japan [9] . In addition, genotype I FRcoV was also detected from many asymptomatic ferrets in the Netherlands [6] . The relationship between genotypes of FRcoV and clinical symptoms remains unclear.
Although FRcoV genes were detected in ferrets by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PcR), there is no method to detect antibodies to FRcoV. We attempted to isolate FRcoV using feline cell lines and our newly established ferret cell line (manuscript in preparation), but the virus has not yet been isolated. Because the nucleocapsid (N) is conserved between coronaviruses and used as an antigen to detect antibody [5, 8] , the N protein of FRcoV was one of the most likely antigen candidates to detect antibody to FRcoV. In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant N proteins was established and applied to investigate the seroprevalence of FRcoV infection in Japan.
Samples from domestic ferrets: From animal hospitals in Japan, 9 serum and 26 plasma samples were collected from domestic ferrets between Aug 1st, 2012 and Feb 4th, 2014 and used for ELISA and immunoblot analysis. We analyzed and reported the results for 79 of the feces samples in our previous study [9] . One fecal sample from a ferret in our animal facility was used to amplify the N gene of the FRcoV Yamaguchi-1 strain.
Amplification of N genes: RNA of the Yamaguchi-1 strain was extracted from feces using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. N genes of the Yamaguchi-1 strain was amplified by RT-PCR using TaKaRa RNA LA PCR TM Kit (AMV) Ver. 1.1 (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). RT was performed using random 9-mer oligonucleotide primers, and PcR was performed using primer pairs, NF2 (5′-TTA CAT ATG GTA TAA GAA CTA AAC-3′) and NR2 (5′-CGA TGT AGG AAC CTT CAA AAT A-3′). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 0.8% gel and extracted using a QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN).
Construction of expression plasmids: Yamaguchi-1 strain fragments were amplified using primer pairs, N1F (5′-TGG GAT CCA TGG CTG GAA ACG GAC CAC-3′) and N179R (5′-GAC TCG AGT TAG TTA TTG GAT CTA TTG TTG GAC-3′) for nt 1-537 encoding a.a. 1-179, and N180F (5′-TGG GAT CCA TTA ACA GTA ACA GTG GTG ATA T-3′) and N374R (5′-GAC TCG AGT TAG TTT AGT TCA TCA ATA ATT TCA-3′) for nt 538-1125 encoding a.a. 180-374. These forward and reverse primers contained BamHI and XhoI sites at the 5′-end, respectively. Fragments were purified using a MinElute PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN) and digested with restriction enzymes, BamHI and XhoI. Two fragments of the Yamaguchi-1 strain were electrophoresed on a 0.8% gel and extracted using a QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Fragments were then cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of the expression plasmid pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.) using a DNA Ligation Kit Ver. 2.1 (TaKaRa). Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia (E.) coli strain DH5α (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan).
Expression and purification of glutathione-S transferase (GST)-fusion proteins: Two N protein fragments, N1-179 and N180-374, were expressed as fusion proteins with GST, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374), respectively. E. coli containing recombinant or control plasmid was cultured in 2 × yeast extract and tryptone (YT) medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract and 0.5% Nacl, pH 7.0) containing 50 µg ampicillin ml −1 . Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1thiogalactopyranoside (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 4 hr. The bacterial cells were suspended in sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.0, 50 mM Nacl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and lysed using a Multi-beads shocker (YASUI KIKAI, Osaka, Japan). After centrifugation, supernatants were mixed with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 1% for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,630 × g at 4°c for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, mixed with glutathione sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated at 4°c for 30 min. After centrifugation, beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and once with sonication buffer. The beads were mixed with 300 µl of 10 mM glutathione and incubated at 4°c for 1 hr. After incubation, supernatants were harvested as purified recombinant proteins and used for ELISA and immunoblot analysis. The purified proteins were confirmed to be single bands by coomassie-brilliant blue (cBB) staining after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis.
SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant proteins: Purified recombinant proteins were mixed in equal volumes of 2 × sample buffer (125 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.002% bromophenol blue and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 3 min. Samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and stained with cBB.
Quantification of recombinant proteins: concentration of purified proteins was measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent concentrate (BIO-RAD, Hercules, cA, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was constructed using bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). The absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (BIO-RAD) at 595 nm.
ELISA: The concentration of purified recombinant proteins was adjusted to 5 µg ml −1 with adsorption buffer (0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). GST was used as a control at 5µg ml −1 . One hundred microliters of purified recombinant proteins and GST were added to 96well microplates (Maxisorp; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After incubation at 37°c for 2 hr, plates were placed at 4°c overnight. The wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with 200 µl of 1% Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) in PBS at 37°c for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS-T, 100 µl of diluted sera or plasma were added to duplicate wells and incubated at 37°c for 30 min. Sera or plasma was diluted to 1:100 or 1:500 with PBS-T containing 0.4% Block Ace. Subsequently, wells were washed three times with PBS-T before 100 µl of peroxidase-conjugated anti-ferret immunoglobulin (ROcKLAND, Limerick, PA, U.S.A.) diluted with PBS-T containing 0.4% Block Ace was added and incubated at 37°c for 30 min. Following three washes with PBS-T, 100 µl of Horseradish Peroxidase Substrate (BIO-RAD) was added to each well. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of 2% oxalic acid to each well. The absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (BIO-RAD) at 415 nm. All results were subtracted from the value for GST, and the cut-off value was arbitrarily set at 0.5. Phylogenetic analysis: A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the program MrBayes Ver. 3.2.2 [7] for MrModeltest analysis with a WAG substitution matrix [10] . We referred to the following sequences to construct the phylogenetic tree of N protein sequences; FREcV strain MSU-2 (GU338457), FREcV strain MSU-1 (DQ340562), FRScV strain MSU-1 (GU338456), mink coV strain WD1127 (HM245925), mink coV strain WD1133 (HM245926), ccoV type II strain fc1 (AB781790), FcoV type II strain M91-267 (AB781788), FcoV type I strain c3663 (AB535528), SARS-coV strain BJ182-12 (EU371564) and FRcoV strain Yamaguchi-1 (Lc029423). The tree was represented graphically using FigTree Ver. 1.4.2 [1] .
Statistical analysis: Significant differences were statistically analyzed using chi-square and Fisher's exact probability tests. P values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
Nucleotide sequence of the Yamaguchi-1 strain N gene (1,125 bp) was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence of N protein (374 amino acids) was phylogenetically analyzed (Fig. 1) . Two recombinant N proteins, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374), based on the Yamaguchi-1 strain were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and used as ELISA antigens with 7 sera and 15 plasma samples from ferrets. Although most samples reacted to both recombinant proteins, the plasma of ferret No.10 and serum of ferret No.22 only reacted to GST-N (1-179) and did not recognize GST-N (180-374) (Fig.  2) . These results indicated that GST-N (1-179) was suitable for detection of antibodies to FRcoVs. Therefore, we de- cided to use GST-N (1-179) in the subsequent investigation.
In addition, a cut-off value was arbitrarily set at OD=0.5.
The plasma of No.10 and serum of ferret No.22 showed differ-ent reactivities from the other samples in ELISA (Fig. 2) . To confirm the different antigenicity, immunoblot analysis was carried out using serum of ferret No.22. Plasma of ferret No.48 was used to compare with serum of ferret No.22. The purified proteins were confirmed to be single bands by cBB staining after SDS-PAGE analysis and used (Fig. 3A) . Plasma of ferret No.48 and serum of ferret No.22 reacted with recombinant protein GST-N (1-179), but only plasma of ferret No.48 also reacted with GST-N (180-374) ( Fig.  3B and 3c) . The results of the immunoblot analysis were consistent with those of the ELISA.
Seroprevalence of FRCoV infection in ferrets in Japan: ELISA using GST-N (1-179) was carried out with 1:100 dilutions of nine sera and 26 plasma samples from domestic ferrets in 12 animal hospitals in five prefectures in Japan. The results showed that 31 of the 35 (89%) ferrets were seropositive for FRCoV infection. There was no significant difference between seropositivity and age or sex (Table 1) .
In this study, we attempted to clarify the seroprevalence of FRcoV in Japan and developed an ELISA using two Yamaguchi-1 strain recombinant N proteins, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374). More ferret serum samples recognized GST-N (1-179) than GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 2 ). In addition, identities of N (1-179) between Yamaguchi-1 and the other FRcoVs (96.6-98.3%) were higher than those of N (180-374) (90.7-93.8%) (data not shown). Therefore, we selected GST-N (1-179) as the ELISA antigen for our serosurvey. Surprisingly, we found that 89% (31/35) of domestic ferrets were seropositive to this antigen by ELISA (Table 1 ). There are reports of FRcoV gene detection in 56%-61% of ferrets in Japan and the Netherlands [6, 9] . These data indicate that FRcoV has already spread within the ferret population and that many ferrets may be persistently infected with FRcoV. However, there was no significant difference between seropositivity and symptoms, age or sex. Further studies are required to clarify the pathogenesis of FRcoV in ferrets. Plasma from ferret No.10 and serum from ferret No.22 showed different reactivities from those of other ferret samples in ELISA, reacting only with GST-N (1-179), but not with GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 2) . The different reactivity of ferret No. 22 serum was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 3c) . These results indicated that GST-N (1-179) is a better choice of antigen for ELISA than GST-N (180-374). ELISA using GST-N (1-179) will be useful for serological surveys for FRcoV. In future studies, this FRcoV infected with ferret No.22 should be analyzed closely.
In conclusion, a new ELISA system using the recombinant N protein of FRcoV, GST-N (1-179), was established. This ELISA will be useful for diagnosis and epidemiological studies on FRcoV infection in ferrets.

90,49fbca70a4e7e3018cab7eb445683c58fd06bce2,"Background. Beginning in December 2013, an epidemic of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection spread across the Caribbean and into virtually all countries in the Western hemisphere, with >2.4 million cases reported through the end of 2017.
Methods. We monitored a cohort of school children in rural Haiti from May 2014, through February 2015, for occurrence of acute undifferentiated febrile illness, with clinical and laboratory data available for 252 illness episodes.
Results. Our findings document passage of the major CHIKV epidemic between May and July 2014, with 82 laboratory-confirmed cases. Subsequent peaks of febrile illness were found to incorporate smaller outbreaks of dengue virus serotypes 1 and 4 and Zika virus, with identification of additional infections with Mayaro virus, enterovirus D68, and coronavirus NL63. CHIKV and dengue virus serotype 1 infections were more common in older children, with a complaint of arthralgia serving as a significant predictor for infection with CHIKV (odds ratio, 16.2; 95% confidence interval, 8.0-34.4; positive predictive value, 66%; negative predictive value, 80%).
Conclusions. Viral/arboviral infections were characterized by a pattern of recurrent outbreaks and case clusters, with the CHIKV epidemic representing just one of several arboviral agents moving through the population. Although clinical presentations of these agents are similar, arthralgias are highly suggestive of CHIKV infection.","The past few decades have been characterized by the emergence and geographic expansion of a series of arboviruses, including dengue virus serotypes 1-4 (DENV1-DENV4), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [1] , and Zika virus (ZIKV) [2] . In December 2013, CHIKV (Asian clade) was identified for the first time in the Western Hemisphere, on the Island of St Martin in the Caribbean [3] . From St Martin, an epidemic wave of CHIKV infection moved across the Caribbean and spread into virtually every country in the hemisphere, with >2.4 million cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization through the end of 2017 [4] . Although the CHIKV epidemic caused substantial morbidity, during the same time period (2013-2017) and in the same region >8.8 million dengue cases were reported to the Pan American Health Organization [5] , together with >800 000 suspected and confirmed ZIKV infections [5] , underscoring the magnitude and diversity of arboviral infections within the population.
Moreira et al [6] have recently summarized results of studies on the epidemiology of acute febrile illness (AFI) in Latin America [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Although these studies have provided a basis for identifying the major pathogens responsible for febrile illness in the region, diagnostic criteria and approaches have differed widely, with no study having the ability to screen for previously unidentified pathogens; across all 17 studies evaluated by Moreira [6] , the median number of pathogens tested per individual was 3.5. Studies have also tended to be cross-sectional, making it difficult to assess patterns of infection with different agents, data which are of potential importance in understanding drivers or facilitators for epidemic disease within the region.
Our group has maintained ongoing surveillance of a cohort of approximately 1250 children attending schools operated by the Christianville Foundation (a US-based nongovernmental organization) in a semirural region in Haiti close to Portau-Prince [11] . In 2012-2013, acute undifferentiated febrile infection (ie, subjective fever in a child with no localizing signs or symptoms) was the third most common presenting complaint at the clinic serving the Christianville schools, with a rate of 235 cases per 1000 child-years of observation [11] . In these 2012-2013 studies, diagnostic testing of children with AFI was limited to screening for malaria (approximately 6% of patients) and possible typhoid fever. In 2014, anticipating the imminent onset of the CHIKV epidemic in Haiti, we expanded our evaluation to include collection of a blood sample for viral screening (including viral cultures) from case patients. Our goal was to diagnose and characterize the clinical and epidemiological features of AFI in these children, to understand temporal patterns of infection and explore differences in clinical presentation.
Our group has previously reported isolation of specific agents from individual members or small groups from this population [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , but we have not looked comprehensively at results or clinical presentations across an extended time period. The current report provides a comprehensive look at all virology results from May 2014 through February 2015, placing previous reports in temporal and phylogenic context; it also provides an in-depth analysis of clinical data from the CHIKV epidemic period.
Blood samples were collected from schoolchildren with AFI seen at the Christianville School clinic beginning in May 2014; the current report summarizes results through February 2015. The clinic at the Christianville School is free and serves as the primary source of medical care for the approximately 1250 children at the 4 school campuses within the Christianville School system ( Figure 1 ): this includes the main LaSalle/Gressier campus, housing kindergarten through grade13 (school A), and 3 small satellite elementary school campuses (schools B, C, and D).
All schoolchildren who presented with AFI (defined based on a subjective history of fever and/or fever on presentation in a child with no obvious source of infection (ie, no respiratory symptoms, symptoms of urinary tract infection, or diagnostic criteria for malaria or typhoid) were included in this study [11] . All clinical data were collected and recorded by the clinic physician or nursing staff, with data extracted from clinical charts for analysis. The University of Florida and Haitian national institutional review boards approved all protocols, and written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of all study participants.
Methods for sample collection and laboratory analysis have been reported elsewhere by our group [13] [14] [15] 19 ]. In brief: whole blood was collected in dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes (BD Vacutainer; Becton Dickinson), and plasma was extracted and frozen at −70°C. Samples were screened for CHIKV, DENV1-4, and ZIKV by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using standard procedures [19] [20] [21] , with all virus isolations and RNA extractions for samples that might be CHIKV positive performed in a biosafety level 3 facility at the University of Florida Emerging Pathogens Institute in Gainesville.
Virus isolations from plasma specimens were attempted in Vero E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1586). Cell cultures were maintained for up to 21 days after inoculation, or until CHIKV-induced cytopathic effects were observed in the cell monolayers. When cytopathic effects were observed throughout 50% of the monolayer, spent medium along with scraped cells were cryopreserved at −80°C for molecular testing. Total RNA extracted from the cell-spent media samples were subsequently tested by real-time reverse-transcription (RT) PCR [20] [21] [22] , even if the corresponding plasma specimen had tested negative. In addition, spent medium from cultures displaying non-CHIKV cytopathic effects, which were DENV and ZIKV negative at real-time RT-PCR, were screened with a duplex RT-PCR for the viral RNAs of other alphaviruses and flaviviruses [23] .
Descriptive statistics were computed for the study population's demographic characteristics and presentation of clinical symptoms by infection status. Demographic-specific attack rates (ARs) for AFI and for each pathogen were calculated by dividing the number of persons in the specific demographic category with the PCR-confirmed infection by the total number of persons in that category. Statistical significance in ARs was determined by comparing the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between categories within each demographic variable; if the 95% CIs did not overlap, the categories were considered significantly different.
Forward and backward stepwise logistic regression models were employed for each pathogen-specific outcome (eg, presence of absence of CHIKV, referred to as ""CHIKV model"") to narrow down the list of candidate predictors for use in the predictive models. The best-fit model for each pathogen outcome was selected so that adding or removing additional variables would not lower the Akaike information criterion. Only the selected variables that were informative (ie, had nonzero, noninfinity point estimates and associated CIs) were included in subsequent analysis.
The best-fit models for each pathogen (referred to as DENV1, DENV4, CHIKV, and CHIKV-ZIKV models) were then trained on a randomly selected 66% of the original data set, and validated against the remaining 34% of the data. This procedure was repeated 100 times for each pathogen model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for the average of the 100 replicates for each pathogen outcome. Predictive statistics including area under the ROC curve, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity were generated.
Finally, K-means clustering was applied to the data, to better observe how collections of clinical symptoms cluster with the presence and absence of each different pathogen. The variables included were binary, so that centroid values closer to 1 indicate that individuals classified into that cluster more often than not had that symptom. All data cleaning and analysis were carried out using R software, version 3.2.1 (R Core Team; 2014), and predictions were implemented using the forecast package [24] .
Clinical and laboratory data were available for 252 children; we estimate that this represents approximately 95% of all children seen in the school clinic who met the criteria for AFI. We identified 223 AFI cases per 1000 child-years of observation, which is marginally less than the 235 cases per 1000 child-years that was observed in 2012-2013 [11] .
Eighty-two children had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of CHIKV infection. Among these, 8 were infected with multiple viruses, including 6 with dual CHIKV-ZIKV, 1 with dual CHIKV-DENV2, and 1 with dual CHIKV and Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection (previously reported in [19] ). Other infections identified included DENV1 (n = 24; 2 dual infections), DENV4 (n = 32), ZIKV (n = 9; 6 dual infections with CHIKV, as noted above, and 1 dual infection with DENV1 [13] ), MAYV (n = 2; 1 dual infection with CHIKV, as noted above, and 1 dual infection with DENV1 [14] ), coronavirus NL63 (n = 4 [15] ), and enterovirus D68 (n = 1 [12] ).
As shown in Figure 2 , major AFI peaks were seen in June 2014, October and November 2014 and January 2015. CHIKV infections accounted for virtually all of the May-July AFI cases, consistent with the time that the CHIKV epidemic was known to be moving through Haiti. The staff at the school clinic initially assumed that the October-November AFI peaks reflected recurrence of CHIKV. However, at laboratory analysis we identified a cluster of DENV1 cases, followed by a small ZIKV cluster in December [14] . However, we were not able to find an cause for the majority of AFI cases in this time period, despite the use of viral culture techniques; work on identification of other possible etiologic agents for AFI cases in this time period continues. Finally, the January 2015 peak seems to have been due largely to an outbreak of DENV4 infection. Study population demographics, including age, sex, school location, and grade are presented in Table 1 , along with demographic-specific ARs for AFI. Students in kindergarten had an AR of 39% (95% CI, 33%-44%), which was significantly greater than those in primary school students (15%; 12%-18%), and secondary school students (20%; 15%-26%). Kindergarteners also represented >45% of the students with AFI, but only 21% of the total cohort.
Pathogen-specific ARs along with their associated 95% CIs are presented in Table 2 by demographic categories. Of note, students in school A (AR, 9%; 95% CI, 7%-11%) had a significantly higher AR for CHIKV than those in school D (1%; 0%-2%).
The proportion of positive cases of each pathogen with specific symptoms is presented in Table 3 . By definition, all children in the study had a history of fever; those with a measured temperature of >37°C when seen in the clinic were included in the category of ""fever at visit. ""
Compared with patients with CHIKV, a significantly greater proportion of patients who tested positive for ""any DENV"" experienced abdominal pain, whereas patients with CHIKV had significantly higher rates of arthralgia and myalgia than those with any DENV. Supplementary Table 1 presents the localization of arthralgias by infection outcome for patients with confirmed CHIKV only and dual CHIKV-ZIKV infection: arthralgias in CHIKV-only patients were most common in the knee (48.9%), wrist (44.7%), and ankle (36.2%). Table 4 shows the results from the 4 stepwise logistic regression models that were performed for variable selection for each of the 4 outcomes of interest. Of note, no single variable was included in every model. Individuals aged 10-14 year or older had significantly greater odds of CHIKV infection than 3-4-year-olds (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-9.8). In addition, patients with AFI who had arthralgia had 16.2-fold increased odds of CHIKV infection (95% CI, 8.0-34.4) compared with patients with AFI who did not present with arthralgia, after adjusting for age category and sex. Although the number of cases was small, the presence of myalgia was significantly associated with increased odds of dual CHIKV-ZIKV infection (odds ratio, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.2-47.6), compared with the absence of myalgia
The variables selected for each pathogen model were then used in additional logistic regression models for each outcome Table 2 ). The mean area under the ROC curve was 0.80 (SD, 0.05; IQR, 0.7-0.83; Supplementary Figure 1 ). In an additional model that predicted the binary CHIKV outcome as a function of presence of arthralgia without any demographic covariates, the PPV was 56% (SD, 0.05; IQR, 0.53-0.60; data not shown). Results from the K-means cluster analysis for all symptoms with 4 clusters are shown in Supplementary Figure 2 , and the cluster assignments by participant infection status are presented in Supplementary Table 3 .
All patients in cluster 1 experienced arthralgia, leg pain, and ankle pain, and >75% experienced myalgia. Twenty-eight of the CHIKV cases were grouped into cluster 3, which also contained the vast majority of ""no pathogen identified"" patients and all with DENV4; patients in this cluster experienced low rates of all symptoms except abdominal pain (approximately 40%) and headache (approximately 25%). Eighteen of the 23 patients grouped into cluster 4 had CHIKV only. Patients in this cluster experienced a wide variety of clinical symptoms, including very high rates of arthralgia, leg pain, knee pain, and myalgia.
CHIKV was first identified in Tanzania in 1952, with subsequent association with sporadic cases of disease and localized outbreaks in Africa and parts of Asia [3] . In 2004, there was a reemergence of the virus, initially in Kenya, with a series of subsequent epidemics in and around the Indian Ocean. In December 2013, CHIKV infections were confirmed for the first time in the western hemisphere [4, 25] . It is clear from our study, and other longitudinal studies [7, 26] , that as the epidemic moved through islands and countries it was the dominant cause of AFI for a period of 2-4 months. However, in both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies [7, 26, 27] , what also emerges is a more complex picture of a mélange of arboviral infections, with frequent coinfections and cases and case clusters attributable to other viruses surrounding the CHIKV epidemic peak. In Haiti, in contrast to other studies that relied on serologic assays, we performed actual viral cultures on a majority of case patients; findings further underscored the extent of coinfections [19] , and resulted in the identification of ""unexpected"" viruses, such as ZIKV and MAYV. It remains to be seen what impact this mix of infections has on host susceptibility and disease occurrence and severity [28, 29] .
As has been noted in multiple studies [8, 22, 23, [30] [31] [32] , it can be difficult, particularly in endemic regions, to identify an infecting arbovirus based solely on clinical presentation. The current study made use of a school cohort, and consequently ages were concentrated between 3 years and 20 years, reflecting attendance in prekindergarten through ""grade 13"" (an additional year of school generally taken as part of the secondary education cycle). As noted above, our clinical staff was convinced that the AFI peak seen in October and November 2014 ( Figure 2 ) reflected a ""recurrence"" of CHIKV; in actuality, it built on a DENV1 case cluster, with some ZIKV mixed in at the end, and a still unidentified presumptive pathogen responsible for the majority of cases. Although we recognize the difficulties inherent in making clinical arboviral diagnoses, our data reinforce the frequency with which arthralgias are seen in CHIKV cases (with knees, wrists, and ankles most commonly affected, in keeping with findings in studies in other locales [9, 30] ).
Within our AFI study population, age, sex, and arthralgias were predictive of CHIKV infection, with a PPV of 66% (Supplementary Table 2 ). The link with age is not immediately clear, but we hypothesize that it reflects lack of immunity to CHIKV among all population age groups for this emergent epidemic, in contrast to the likelihood of immunity to other endemic agents, such as DENV, among older students. Obviously, the PPV will drop with low-level endemicity, compared with epidemic CHIKV; nonetheless, arthralgias seem to be useful markers for initial recognition of a possible CHIKV outbreak and targeting of the diagnostic workup.
This study is subject to some limitations. Samples were collected through a syndromic surveillance program whereby children who presented to the school clinic with a history of fever and/or had a fever at the time of the clinic visit (but no other localizing signs or symptoms) had blood collected and tested for viral infections. Given that viremia is relatively transient in some of these infections, it is possible that children with a history of fever, but no fever when seen in the clinic, were past the period of viremia, resulting in an underestimation of actual case numbers. Different rates of asymptomatic and subclinical infection for the various pathogens may also have resulted in differential case detection, potentially biasing our results.
Furthermore, the spectrum of clinical illness in patients who did experience symptomatic infections may be variable, which could influence care seeking. For example, because of the link between CHIKV infection and arthralgias, patients with CHIKV may have been more likely to seek medical care [33] . In addition, the clinical symptom data used in this analysis were not collected in a questionnaire format. Rather, symptom presence or absence was elicited from patients on presentation to the clinic as part of a routine medical history. Thus, it is possible that less severe (or perceived less severe) symptoms were not reported by the patient and thus incorrectly marked as ""absent"" in the medical records. Despite these limitations, our data provide a unique picture of the shifting causes of AFI in Haiti, and they highlight the apparent endemicity of a number of arboviral species. Interesting questions regarding viral origins are also raised by our identification of a cluster of ZIKV/CHIKV dual infections in May and June of 2014, at the very beginning of what subsequently became the ZIKV epidemic; as previously reported by our group, CHIKV and ZIKV strains from coinfected patients clustered monophyletically in their respective phylogeny, with molecular clock analysis suggesting that the 2 clades were introduced into the local population within overlapping time frames [19] .
As in any study of arboviruses, there is also a need to link findings with entomologic data. White et al [34] have recently published results of mosquito studies within this same region and time period, which demonstrated exclusive carriage of CHIKV by Aedes aegypti; however, in studies conducted in 2016, we isolated a new ""American"" subgroup of African lineage CHIKV from Aedes albopictus in this same area of Haiti, further highlighting the dynamic flow of strains (and vectors) across time. Clearly, ongoing surveillance is essential within this setting, both to monitor occurrence and transmission pathways of known pathogens, such as CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV, and MAYV, and to identify new and emergent viruses and viral clades, which may, in turn, form the basis for future epidemics.

91,87b8b85391605bcd1b6c7ddaf1189b3229db4e06,"There are many challenges to quantifying and evaluating the media impact on the control of emerging infectious diseases. We modeled such media impacts using a piecewise smooth function depending on both the case number and its rate of change. The proposed model was then converted into a switching system, with the switching surface determined by a functional relationship between susceptible populations and different subgroups of infectives. By parameterizing the proposed model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the Shaanxi province of China, we observed that media impact switched off almost as the epidemic peaked. Our analysis implies that media coverage significantly delayed the epidemic's peak and decreased the severity of the outbreak. Moreover, media impacts are not always effective in lowering the disease transmission during the entire outbreak, but switch on and off in a highly nonlinear fashion with the greatest effect during the early stage of the outbreak. The finding draws the attention to the important role of informing the public about 'the rate of change of case numbers' rather than 'the absolute number of cases' to alter behavioral changes, through a self-adaptive media impact switching on and off, for better control of disease transmission. E merging infectious diseases such as the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 1,2 and the 2009 novel influenza A(H1N1) pandemic 3,4 have significant societal impacts not only through diseaseinduced morbidity and mortality, but also through their interference with socio-economic activities and population movement. Global public health systems of surveillance and response have been substantially improved in order to curb an emerging disease by containing it at source 5-7 or by slowing down its spread from the source 8,9 . Effective public health information processing is at the core of any global surveillance and response system. This is because at the start of an emerging epidemic, massive news coverage and fast information flow can generate profound psychological impacts on the public, and hence greatly alter individuals' behaviour and influence the implementation of public intervention and control policies 10 . How long and how effective media impact remains is therefore an issue of great importance for future epidemics control, and quantifying this impact through a mathematical modeling framework falls within the scope of this study.
Recently, several mathematical models have been proposed to investigate media impacts. Existing approaches to modeling the impact of media coverage have focused on how this coverage depends on the number of infected individuals 11-14 , where prototype decreasing functions such as e 2mI , e {a1E{a2I{a3H (with H denoting hospitalized individuals, I infectives, E exposed individuals and nonnegative constants m, a i , i 5 1, 2, 3) and c 1 2 c 2 f(I) (with constants c 1 , c 2 ) have been embedded into the incidence rate. However, individuals may also change their behaviour due to their awareness and interpretation of the rate of change of the case numbers. Here we propose a novel mathematical model to represent the behavioral changes or implementation of interventions which are dependent on both the case number and its rate of change. We hope to examine how long media impacts last and how effective they are for different types of behavioral changes. In practice, media impact affects disease control (or spread) in conjunction with other visible measures, including non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (e.g., quarantine and isolation following contact tracing) and pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) (e.g., vaccines, treatment). We also incorporate these interventions into our model in order to identify the most effective strategy (or combination of strategies) including media impacted-behavioral changes to mitigate the epidemic during the entire outbreak.
The model with media impact. We investigate a general SIR(susceptible-infective-recovery)-type epidemiological model, which incorporates media impacts and other interventions such as quarantine, isolation, vaccination and OPEN SUBJECT AREAS: APPLIED MATHEMATICS INFECTIOUS DISEASES","treatment. We stratify the usual susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) compartments in the classical SIR model 15 , to include the quarantined susceptible (S q ) and isolated infected (I q ) compartments. With contact tracing, a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined. The quarantined individuals can either move to compartment I q or S q , depending on whether they are infected or not 16, 17 , while the remaining proportion, 1 2 q, of individuals exposed to the virus, but missed from the contact tracing, move to the infectious compartment I (once infected) or stay in compartment S (if uninfected). Let the media-influenced transmission probability be b and the contact rate be a constant c. Then the quarantined individuals, if infected (or uninfected), move to the compartment I q (or S q ) at a rate of bcq (or (1 2 b)cq). Those who are not quarantined, if infected, will move to the compartment I at a rate of bc(1 2 q). The infected individuals can be detected and then isolated at a rate of d I , and can also move to the compartment R due to recovery. The transmission dynamics is illustrated in Fig. 1 .
We assume that media has impacts on individual behavioural changes via responses to the case number or to the rate of change of the case numbers, or to both [18] [19] [20] . We then model such media impacts with a decreasing function. Here we will use as a prototype the media-impact function b 0 e 2M(t) , where
and p 1 , p 2 , q 1 , q 2 are non-negative parameters. The standard SIR model can then be modified as S'~L{mS{P S SI{n S SzlS q , I'~P I SI{ d I zazmzd I ð Þ I, S' q~QS SI{ lzn Sq zm À Á S q , I' q~QI SIzd I I{ d Iq zazm À Á I q , R'~n S Szn S q S q zd I Izd I q I q {mR,
where 9 is the derivative with respect to time, and b 5 exp 2M(t) b 0 , P S 5 bc 1 cq(1 2 b), P I 5 bc(1 2 q), Q S 5 (1 2 b)cq, Q I 5 bcq with baseline transmission probability b 0 . We also assume that susceptible and quarantined susceptible individuals are also vaccinated at the per capita rates n and n Sq , respectively. We denote d I and d Iq as the recovery rates of infected patients and isolated infected individuals, respectively, and L and m the recruitment rate to the susceptible population and the natural death rate, respectively. The other parameters are defined in Table 1 . The model we propose here differs from previous studies of the effect of media coverage [11] [12] [13] [14] in that our formulated media-impact function depends on both the case number and its rate of change. As the rates of change can be negative, our model has to involve a piecewise smooth function.
Media-impact switching surface. When the media impact involves the rate of change of the case numbers (I9(t) or I' q t ð Þ), the model (2) is an implicit system of differential equations. Interestingly, we show that such a system can be converted into a switching system based on an analytically computable functional relationship S c 5 S c (I, I q ) between the susceptible and infected/infected quarantined populations. This conversion is possible thanks to some important properties of the Lambert W function 21 .
To be more specific, we let

using some important properties of the Lambert W function (see electronic supplementary information (SI) and reference 21 for details). Also, as shown in SI, M 1 (t) . 0 is equivalent to S(t) . S c , with S c 5 S c (I, I q ) given by S c~p 2 m I Izq 2 m I q I q {d I I À Á {p 1 I{q 1 I q mI
:
Therefore, we can characterize the transmission probability as follows:
The dynamic transmission model (2) subject to media impact (1) is now converted to system (2) subject to the switching condition determined by the switching surface S 5 S c (I, I q ). In the literature on control, model (2) with (6) is regarded as a qualitative description of a threshold policy (TP), referred to as an on-off control (or a special and simple case of variable structure control) [22] [23] [24] . Note that the critical level S c determines whether the media impact is effective in lowering the incidence rate, and is called the switching surface. Generally speaking, the critical level is used as a guide for starting/ suspending strategies, and hence this level determines when the intervention strategies are implemented 25, 32 . The formula S c reveals dependence of the switching surface on the parameters and the numbers of infected and isolated individuals. During the disease outbreak, the switching surface S c and the number of susceptible individuals change. Depending on the relative sizes of these populations, the media impact switches on and off dynamically. To examine how long and/or how often the media impact remains effective, we simulate the switching system using the parameters listed in Table 1 . It is interesting to note that media impact remains effective almost until the peak of the epidemic, and then switches off, as shown in Fig. 2 (B-C). This figure also shows that media impact may switch on again during the subsequent waves. In particular, increasing the susceptible size S(0) at day 50 induces the second wave. During this second wave media impact switches on, as shown in Fig. 2 (B-C).
To identify which parameter or variable the switching surface (S c ) is sensitive to, we conducted a sensitive analysis by evaluating the partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) for all input parameters against the output variable S c . Although the variables I and I q , are dependent on the equation (2) with (6), our sensitivity analysis is performed with I and I q directly varying in relatively large intervals. We chose a normal distribution for all parameters with mean values and half standard deviations given in Table 1 . Fig. 2(D) shows the PRCCs which illustrate the dependence of S c on each parameter and variables I and I q . This sensitivity analysis shows that the first five parameters with most impact on S c are the recovery rate of the infected individuals (d I ), the transmission probability (b 0 ), the contact rate (c), isolation rate (d I ) and quarantine rate (q). Fig. 2 (D) also shows that S c is more sensitive to the weight parameter p 2 (or q 2 ) than to the parameter p 1 (or q 1 ). Therefore, we conclude that it is the response to the rate of change of the case numbers, rather than the case numbers, that has significant impact on the switching surface.
The switching system has the disease-free equilibrium E 0 5 (L/ m S , 0, 0, 0), which is locally asymptotically stable provided that the basic reproduction number R 0 , 1, where
Note that this threshold R 0 is the same as that for the model in the absence of media impact. In other words, the media impact does not affect the epidemic threshold. This is in agreement with findings of refs. 11-13. When R 0 . 1, two subsystems (the subsystems for S , S c and for S . S c ) have their own respective endemic states. See SI for details, see also ref. 25 and references therein for discussion about 'virtual' and 'regular' endemic equilibria and their relevance to disease infection dynamics. Here we focus on how long and how effective the media impact remains, based on the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in the Shaanxi province of China.
The estimated media-impact switching time. We obtained data on laboratory-confirmed cases of the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in the Shaanxi province of China (shown in Fig. 3 (A) and (B)) from the Province's Public Health Information System 17 . Note that the number of hospital notifications and the growth rate of these notifications were regularly available to the public during the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. It is these notifications and their rate of change with time that contributed to the public awareness of the pandemic, and hence contributed to individuals' behaviour. So, we initially set p 1 and p 2 to zero and conducted sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of varying p 1 , p 2 on disease outcomes (total number of infected individuals and hospital notifications). The demographic effects are not considered in the following discussion because of the short epidemic time scale in comparison to the demographic time scale, that is, L 5 m 5 0. Furthermore, no disease-related death was reported in mainland China before mid October 2009 17, 26 and no vaccine against A/H1N1 was available until the end of November 2009. Therefore, we set a 5 0 and n S~nSq~0 in our parameter estimation. By fitting the model (2) with (6) to hospital notifications (from 3 September to 12 October) we estimated all unknown parameters (listed in Table 1 ) and derived the goodness of fit (shown in Fig. 3(C) ). The estimates on media impact (q 1 5 0.00074, q 2 5 0.5793) suggest that individuals are more significantly influenced by the rate of change of the number of hospital notifications than the number of hospital notifications. Moreover, our model is also able to exhibit the second wave, shown in Fig. 3(D) , and the estimated parameter values are listed in Table S2 in SI. We note that the initial data for the second wave and some parameters associated with interventions during the second wave are different from those for the first wave, while other parameters are kept unchanged. This is because the first wave was mostly confined to university/college students, while the second wave took off following the October National Day holiday during which population mobility increased and strict campus-relevant intervention measures (such as Fengxiao) were suspended, leading to general population susceptible to the H1N1 infection 17, 26 .
As the disease spreads to general population, interventions applied to the general population such as quarantine or isolation could not be as strict as those for the university/college students during the first wave due to limited medical and public health resources. This explains why a greater initial value for the susceptible population and a greater contact rate, but lower isolation or quarantine rates, were estimated for the second wave, compared with those for the first wave. Based on the estimated parameter values listed in Table 1 and the formula S c defined by (5), we calculate that the mean of the first switching time is T S 5 25.47 days. The distributions of the first switching time T S associated with 100000 samples of a Markov Chain (obtained from parameter estimation) is given in Fig. 4(A) . Similarly, we obtained the distribution of the first peak time for the number of infected individuals and for the hospital notifications, shown in Fig. 4 (B) and (C), respectively. It is interesting to note that the mean of the first peak time for the hospital notifications is estimated to be 25.52, which coincides very well with the first switching time. Note that the first case in Xi'an City was reported on September 3rd 2009, which was assumed to be the initial date. It follows from our estimated first switching time, based on our proposed model with media-impact switching surface, that media impact remains effective until around September 29th, a day before the National Day holiday (from October 1st to the 7th) started. Hence the model predicts that the media impact switched to the ''off'' mode on September 29. This is in excellent alignment with the real situation during the national holiday season: no H1N1 infection data available, little media coverage, no travel warning issued, and consequently individuals behaved as they would normally do during the holiday (travelling and attending social gatherings) 17 . In other words, media impact actually became ineffective (i.e. the ''off'' mode) as the holiday started. Hence, the predicted timing of switch off of the media impact almost coincides with the real timing of switch off of the media. This adds further validation of our proposed model.
Comparison with results ignoring media impact. To illustrate how the transmission probability with media impact b~b 0 exp {EM 1 t ð Þ ð Þ varies with disease spread (again we consider the case where p 1 5 p 2 5 0), we plotted b as a function of time in Fig. 5(A) . Fig. 5(B) shows the fitted epidemic curve on hospital notifications. Note that the transmission probability with media impact b might either be an increasing concave function or an increasing function based on the epidemic as shown in Fig. 5(B) , depending on the values of q 1 and q 2 . Since the estimated value of q 2 is much greater than the estimated value of q 1 , b increases initially and then levels off due to the media impact switching off. This indicates that the media impact, acting as a factor in reducing transmission, continuously weakened and finally switched off almost immediately after the epidemic peak. Repeating the above process without considering media impact (i.e., p i 5 q i 5 0, i 5 1, 2) and plotting the transmission probability and the corresponding epidemic curve gives the constant transmission probability (shown in Fig. 5(E) ) and the simulated epidemic curve (Fig. 5(F) ). It follows from Fig. 5 (F) that the disease instantaneously takes off and then quickly drops due to the rapid depletion of susceptible populations. Comparing Fig. 5(B) with (F) further shows that media impact significantly delayed the epidemic peak and decreased the severity of the outbreak.
When p 2 5 q 2 5 0 in the function M(t) in (1), model (2) reduces to the usual explicit system with media impact, that was investigated in several recent studies 11, 12 . Plotting the corresponding transmission probability (b 0 e {q1Iq ) shows that media impact is effective in lowering transmission probability during the entire outbreak (shown in Fig. 5(C) ). In such a scenario, media impact remains effective as long as there are infected individuals in the population and the impact is the greatest when the epidemic peaks. It also indicates that media impact increases as the number of infected individuals rises, and then weakens with epidemic waning. In contrast, incorporating the dependence on the rate of change of the case numbers in the media impact transmission probability makes the model a switching system. Consequently, media impact alternately switches on or off. On the other hand, this incorporation of the dependence on the rate of change of the case numbers makes the transmission probability the lowest at t 5 0, reflecting the greatest effect of the media impact observed at the beginning of the epidemic.
The key processes or parameters for integrated mitigation. To identify key parameters and/or intervention measures that influenced the disease infection dynamics, we used Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) to examine the dependence of the total number of infected individuals on corresponding parameters [27] [28] [29] . Again, we chose a normal distribution for all input parameters with the mean values and half standard deviations given in Table 1 . We calculated PRCCs between parameters related to integrated disease control measures (IDCMs)(all possible interventions including media impact) and the output variable (here, the total number of infected individuals I 1 I q ) over time, as shown in Fig. 6(A) . It follows that the significance of the effect of parameters on the output variable changes over time. In particular, we note that 1) some parameters become more and more correlated to the output (e.g. d I , n Sq ); 2) some become less and less correlated to the output (e.g. b 0 , q, d I ); and 3) some are consistently insignificantly correlated to the output (e.g. n S , d Iq ).
We then generated Fig. 6 (B) according to high (jPRCCsj $ 0.4), moderate (0.2 # jPRCCsj , 0.4) and low (0 # jPRCCsj , 0.2) correlations between IDCM parameters and the output variable. Fig. 6(B) shows that variations in transmission probability b 0 , isola- tion rate d I and quarantine rate q dominate the PRCCs during the early stages of the disease outbreak (especially before the epidemic peak). In contrast, great coverage of vaccination (increasing n Sq ) is the most effective control measure during the late stage of the disease outbreak (after the epidemic's peak). Moreover, parameter d I is strongly correlated with the output almost throughout the entire outbreak, confirming that strengthening treatment (especially for non-isolated infected individuals) is effective throughout the entire outbreak. In the early stages of the disease outbreak, enhancing quarantine and isolation after contact tracing (increasing parameter q and d I ) followed by implementation of such measures as frequent handwashing and wearing of masks (decreasing b 0 ), are the most effective integrated mitigation measures. This is consistent with the findings of Fraser (2004) 30 , who argued that isolating symptomatic individuals and quarantining their contacts are two effective public health measures in controlling outbreaks.
It is worth noting that parameters p 1 and p 2 , associated with awareness of the number of infected individuals and the rate of change of the numbers of infected individuals, change from more (negatively) correlated to less (negatively) correlated to the output as the infection progresses, whereas parameters q 1 and q 2 , associated with awareness to the number of isolated infectives and the rate of change of the numbers of isolated infectives, are consistently less correlated to the output. Moreover, the switching surface is more sensitive to parameters p 1 and p 2 than to parameters q 1 and q 2 . This indicates that increasing the awareness to the number of infected individuals and the rate of change of the numbers of infected individuals, if practical, greatly affects the switching surface, and the total number of infected individuals during the early stage of an outbreak. In practice, however, we have very limited information on the number of non-isolated infected individuals, and hence it will be difficult to increase individuals' awareness using this information.
It has been observed that media impacts play an important role in generating public awareness and promoting disease mitigation measures 20 . Our study examined media impact using a piecewise smooth function to reflect that individuals' awareness depends on both the number of cases and its rate of change. As such, we obtained an implicitly defined system 25 . This modeling approach adds to a few recent studies on media impact [11] [12] [13] by including the dependence of media impact and behavioral change on the rate of change of disease cases. Interestingly, this piecewise smooth and implicitly defined model can be successfully converted, using the Lambert function, into a switching system 22, 23, 31, 32 , which has been widely used in modern theory and applications of control. This permitted us to describe the critical level for the number of susceptibles (e.g. S c ) above (below) which media impact remains effective (ineffective) and consequently the disease transmission rate is reduced (unchanged).
We observed that the switching surface S c , dependent on numbers of different subgroups of infected individuals, is not a constant (hyperplane). This switching surface S c given in (5) becomes a constant only if we ignore the population that is isolated (or treated/ hospitalized). In practice, it is this number that is known with some certainty, and it is this number that may be released to the public in a timely fashion. Our results indicate that this number also makes the switching on/off of media impact dynamic (temporally varying) and potentially adaptive.
It worth noting that the media impact does not always remain effective for reducing transmission during the entire outbreak but it does switch on or off during the outbreak. This switch is most effective if it is guided by the rate of change of the disease cases, as we have shown in this study. We also demonstrated in Fig. 2 that media impact switches on and off multiple times depending on the duration of the outbreak, and this becomes a possible source for the observed multiple waves. Our study suggests that the occurrence of multiple waves may be relevant to the fact that the number of susceptible individuals oscillates around the threshold S c (correspondingly, the number of infected individuals also oscillates). This means that, first of all, the media impact on the disease outbreak is a dynamic process; and secondly, that the media impact has its greatest effect in reducing disease transmission at the initial stage of an outbreak. This is in contrast to previous studies [11] [12] [13] 33 , in which the reduction effect of the media reaches its maximum near the outbreak peak (shown in Fig. 5(C-D) ).
A comprehensive understanding of media impacts during an epidemic threat can aid in the development of an implementable public health policy. Of particular interest to designers of such policies are the effects of the media on some important epidemic characteristics such as the magnitude of the peak, its timing and the total number of infections. Our model and analysis, like those in previous studies [11] [12] [13] [14] 33 , confirm that quantifying these effects provides further insights. In particular, the switching on and off of media impacts, as a result of individual behavioural responses to the rate of change of case numbers, leads to the greatest effect on the disease transmission during the early stage of the outbreak. This finding draws attention to the important role of informing the public about ''the rate of change of case numbers'' rather than ''the absolute number of cases'' in order to influence behavioral changes, through a self-adaptive media impact on-off switching, for a better control of the disease transmission.
By fitting data on laboratory-confirmed cases during the 2009 pandemic of A/H1N1 influenza in the province of Shaanxi to our proposed model, we were able to obtain estimates of the unknown parameter values and the mean time of media-impact switching on and off. In particular, the estimated mean time when media impact switched off was about 25.47 days after the initiation of the outbreak. This result, together with the initial date of September 3rd 2009, leads to the conclusion that media impacts switched off on September 29th 2009. This is almost consistent with the realistic timing when the media impact became ineffective, represented by the fact that individual behaviours switched to regular holiday mode since a travel warning was not issued during China's National Day holiday (from 1st October to 7th October).
It follows from Fig. 4(A) and (C) that the media impact switched off just after the epidemic peaked. This was further demonstrated in Fig. 2 (C) This observation on the consistency of media-impact switching and epidemic peaking supports the conclusion that the weakest effect of media impacts always occurs near the epidemic peak. Our sensitivity analysis indicated that the effect of media impact is much more sensitive to the parameter q 2 (the weight representing individuals' response to the rate of change of case numbers) than the parameter q 1 (the weight representing individuals' responses to the case numbers). This finding also explains why the switching time is always consistent with the peak time of the curve for the isolated infected individuals, since near the peak time, the rate of change of the case numbers is close to zero.
By fitting the proposed model to the aforementioned real data, we obtained reasonable estimations for the parameter ranges and the curve fitting Fig. 3(D) . We have also tried to fit the model using the probability transmission function that depends only on the case numbers [11] [12] [13] , or simply a classical epidemic model without considering media impact. Within reasonable parameter values, the simulations using the model without considering media-impact, or using the model with media impact depending only on the case numbers, gave very poor fits to the A/H1N1 data, as shown in SI Fig. S1 (A-B) .
The analysis based on the PRCCs, identifying the key (mitigation) input variables that contributed to the infection outcome, strongly supported the implementation of an integrated strategy of different mitigation measures, including media impact, to curb the outbreak during different phases of the epidemic. The PRCCs show that the most important parameters that contributed to the total case numbers were parameters associated with quarantine (q), isolation rate (d I ) and transmission rate (including transmission probability b 0 , and the weight measuring the media impact p 1 , p 2 ) during the early stage of the disease outbreak. In other words, we confirmed that enhancing quarantine and isolation (increasing parameters q and d I ), improving disease awareness (increasing p 1 , p 2 ) and personal hygiene (decreasing b 0 ) are the most effective measures to be adopted in an integrated strategy for mitigation during the early stage of the outbreak.
The total number of cases is barely sensitive to variation in parameter n S . This observation, perhaps surprising at first glance, seems to be highly relevant to the unique characteristic of the first wave in China. The majority of susceptible individuals, during the early stage of the 2009 A/H1N1 infection in Shaanxi, China, were university students and most universities implemented relatively stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like Fengxiao at the beginning of the first wave 17, 26 . Hence, the number of susceptible individuals significantly declined.
In conclusion, this study presents a novel methodology to convert an implicitly defined compartmental model into a switching system with explicitly defined switching surface. Using this methodology, this study demonstrated that media impact exhibits dynamic on-off switching, depending on the relationship between the number of susceptible individuals and different subgroups of infectives at any time during the outbreak. The modeling analysis emphasizes the important role of behavioral changes in response to the rate of change of the case numbers, and concludes that media impact effects switched off when the epidemic peaked.
Data. We used data on laboratory-confirmed cases of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in the Shaanxi province of China acquired from the Province's Public Health Information System 17 . The data included information on the cumulative number of reported cases, the cumulative number of cured cases and the number of new cases. The Shaanxi Bureau of Health started to report cases daily on September 3rd 2009 (shown in Fig. 3 ) and then changed, on September 19th and November 17th to report once every two days and once every week, respectively. No data were available at weekends. The majority of cases in the province in early September were associated with university/college campuses 17, 26 . All confirmed cases in mainland China were isolated in health care facilities, were treated, and were assumed to be unable to spread the disease once isolated.
Parameter estimation. Due to irregular reporting of data in the province of Shaanxi (e.g. reporting delays at weekends) and changes to reporting policy, we had to generate daily hospital cases using the cubic spline interpolation method, implemented as a Matlab program. We used an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to carry out the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure to estimate the parameters and their standard deviations based on data from hospital notifications between September 3rd and October 12th for the Shaanxi province and using model (2) with the media impact function specified in (6) . The algorithm runs for 500000 iterations with a burn-in of 300000 iterations, with the Geweke convergence diagnostic method employed to assess the convergence.",Media impact switching surface during an infectious disease outbreak,"Xiao, Yanni; Tang, Sanyi; Wu, Jianhong",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296304/,632,4720,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,08079db5747d09016612f319e154ff81c4d9aef5,"Macrophage polarization is a process by which macrophages acquire a distinct phenotypic and functional profile in response to microenvironmental signals. The classically and alternatively activated (M1 and M2, respectively) macrophage phenotypes are defined by the specific molecular characteristics induced in response to prototypic pro-and anti-inflammatory cues. In this study, we used LPS/IFN-γ and IL-4 to stimulate porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in vitro and investigated the expression changes of several novel markers during macrophage polarization. Notably, we found that LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated PAMs express prototypical M1 molecules, whereas IL-4-stimulated PAMs express M2 molecules. We also demonstrated that replication of the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain HuN4 was effectively suppressed in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated M1 PAMs (M1 type), but not IL-4 stimulated M2 PAMs. However, this was not observed with the classic, less pathogenic CH-1a strain. Moreover, we found that M2 marker expression gradually increased after PAM infection with PRRSV, whereas no significant changes were found with M1 marker expression, suggesting that PRRSV infection may skew macrophage polarization towards an M2 phenotype. Finally, we found that anti-viral cytokine expression was significantly higher in M1 macrophages than in M2 macrophages or nonpolarized controls. In summary, our results show that PRRSV replication was significantly impaired in M1 PAMs, which may serve as a foundation for further understanding of the dynamic phenotypic changes during macrophage polarization and their effects on viral infection.
KEY WORDS: M1/M2 polarization, porcine alveolar macrophages, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, viral replication","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes a complex systemic disease in pigs that primarily affects the respiratory and reproductive systems of infected hosts, resulting in significant economic losses in the swine industry worldwide [4, 20, 32] . PRRSV infection is characterized by spontaneous abortion and poor reproductive performance in pregnant sows, respiratory distress in young pigs and high mortality in piglets [22] . PRRSV has a very narrow cellular tropism, showing a preference for monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Specifically, the virus infects certain subsets of differentiated macrophages in the lung, lymphoid tissues and placenta and replicates in testicular germ cells and monocytic lineage cells, particularly porcine alveolar macrophages [5, 6, 24, 30] . Thus, the lungs and lymphoid organs are obvious locations of prolonged viral replication and persistence [16] .
Macrophages play an important role in the first line of defense against invading pathogens, where they act as immune effectors and antigen presenting cells [9] . Macrophages also play a significant functional role in osteochondral repair [1, 8, 14] . Within fractures, macrophages are recruited during the early inflammatory phase and persist throughout the repair process [1] . During this time, macrophages polarize towards distinct phenotypes in response to environmental cues to support the multiple events occurring during wound repair [21] . In vitro exposure to interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) polarizes macrophages doi: 10 .1292/jvms.17-0258 towards a classically activated M1 phenotype marked by the release of catabolic, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [18] . The M1 phenotype triggers proinflammatory responses required to kill intracellular pathogens [10] . In contrast, macrophages are polarized to an alternatively activated M2 phenotype following IL-4, IL-10, or IL-13 stimulation. M2 macrophages release limited levels of pro-inflammatory factors; rather they secrete high levels of antiinflammatory molecules including IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and IL-10 [18] . During inflammation, M2 macrophages serve to protect against tissue damage [13] . Most monocytotropic viral infections, such as those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) and influenza A virus (IAV), may affect macrophage polarization and thereby potentiate immunosuppression and/or immunopathology, which are generally associated with viral persistence and co-infections by pathogens of other phyla [2, 19, 34] . The consequence of viral infection on macrophage polarization has been directly demonstrated in HIV and RSV infections, and is associated with infections caused by human herpes viruses, IAV, SARS-CoV and other viruses [27] .
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the consequence of PRRSV replication on porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM) polarization. For this, we established a macrophage polarization model using primary PAMs stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ or IL-4 to induce M1 or M2 polarization, respectively. M1 polarization was identified by the expression of IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas M2 polarization was characterized by IL-10 and other anti-inflammatory molecules. Notably, we found that M1 polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression significantly inhibited PRRSV replication, which was not observed in M2 cells. Moreover, PRRSV infection can effectively inhibit the release of interferons in PAMs and preferentially skew polarization to the M2 phenotype.
MARC-145 cells at passage 5, the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) isolate HuN4 (GenBank Accession No. EF635006), and the classic PRRSV isolate CH-1a (GenBank Accession No. AY032626) were kindly provided by the PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome) research group of the National Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Harbin, China). The PRRSV CH-1a strain is the first PRRSV isolate reported in China and belongs to the North American subtype, which displays relatively low pathogenicity in experimentally infected pigs. All viruses were used at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) that resulted in a 50% infection rate in PAM or MARC-145 cells at 10 hr postinoculation.
PAMs were isolated from 4-6-week-old conventional pigs from a farm serologically free of PRRSV, porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), Haemophilus parasuis and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae by using a lung lavage technique as previously described [33] with minor modifications. Briefly, piglet lungs were washed five times with PBS and the fluid was centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The cell pellets were then resuspended, and mixed with 20 ml of RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37°C. PAMs were cultivated for 24 hr before infection and attachment experiments. MARC-145 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37°C. Cells were grown to 90% confluence in sterile cell culture flasks and gently detached using a scraper (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.).
For polarization experiments, cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 1.5 × 10 6 cells/well in Costar 12-well plates (Corning Inc., Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.) and cultured for 1 hr to enable attachment. To generate M1 PAMs, cells were treated with LPS (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A.) and IFN-γ (R&D Systems) at various concentration combinations (10 ng/ml + 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml + 50 ng/ml or 1,000 ng/ml + 100 ng/ml, respectively) for 6, 12, 24, 30, 36 and 48 hr. Alternatively, PAMs were treated with IL-4 (R&D Systems) at increasing concentrations (10, 50 or 100 ng/ml) for 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr to induce M2 polarization. Control cells were grown under identical conditions, but not exposed to LPS/IFN-γ or IL-4.
Control, M1 and M2 PAMs were infected with HP-PRRSV or CH-1a at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Multiple aliquots of culture supernatants were collected at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr post-infection (hpi) and stored at −20°C to assess viral titers. At the end of each infection experiment, supernatants were thawed and analyzed for viral content by measuring the levels of virion-associated reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein expression. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.
PAMs were fixed with cold methanol-acetone 
Polarized or control PAMs were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 0.1. At selected time points, cells were collected and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Co., Shanghai, China), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. The protein concentration was then determined by using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). Equal amounts of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, U.S.A.). After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with anti-PRRSV N protein mouse monoclonal antibody SDOW17 (1:10,000, RTI) for 1 hr at 37°C. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat-anti mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000, Imgenex Corp., San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) at room temperature for 1 hr. After washing three times in TBST, membranes were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, U.S.A.).
Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) with the oligo (dT) 18 primer. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Dalian, China) and a ViiA 7 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). For quantitative analysis of PRRSV in tissues, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as previously described [29] . Relative gene expression was evaluated using the 2 −ΔΔCt method [20] . Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as an endogenous control. The specific primers used are listed in Table 1 .
Flow cytometry analysis was performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), and the data were analyzed using Expo 32 software (Becton-Dickinson). Flow cytometry antibodies included FITC-conjugated mouse anti-pig macrophage monoclonal antibody (MAb) clone BA4D5 (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, U.K.), FITC-conjugated mouse anti-TLR4 (Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.) and APC-conjugated anti-arginase 1 (R&D Systems).
The nitrite concentration in the culture medium was measured as an indicator of NO production using the Griess reaction. The supernatant from each well (50 µl) was transferred to a fresh 96-well plate, and 25 µl of 1% sulfanilamide with 25 µl of 0.1% naphthyl ethylenediamine in 5% HCl was added. When combined, these compounds (known as Griess reagent) form a violet color in the presence of nitrite. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance of each well was measured at 540 nm. The nitrite concentration was calculated based on the standard reference curve of known concentrations of sodium nitrite ranging from 0 to 100 mM. 
Arginase activity assays were performed as previously described [17] . Briefly, cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. Tris-HCl and MnCl 2 were added to yield final concentrations of 12.5 and 1 mM, respectively. Arginase was activated by heating for 10 min at 56°C, and the L-arginine substrate was added to a 250 mM final concentration. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and stopped by addition of H 2 SO 4 /H 3 PO 4 . After addition of α-isonitrosopropiophenone and heating for 30 min at 95°C, urea production was measured by the absorbance at 540 nm and normalized to total protein content.
MARC-145 cells (10,000/well) were seeded into 96-well plates the day before infection. The HP-PRRSV strain was serially diluted 10-fold in medium, and 100 µl of each dilution was added into six wells. The CPE (cytopathic effect) was monitored over 4 days using an inverted microscope. The number of infected cells was recorded, and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) was determined by the Reed-Muench method.
Scanning electron microscopy was used for high-magnification confirmation of macrophage morphology after stimulation with IFN-γ/LPS or IL-4. After 24 hr of stimulation at 37°C, cells were fixed with 2.5% electron microscopy-grade glutaraldehyde and 1% OsO 4 , dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in isoamyl acetate. The samples were then dried to a critical point, mounted on aluminum stubs and shadowed with gold. A scanning electron microscope (S-3400N, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 20 kV was used for visualization.
Macrophage morphology was assessed by confocal microscopy after staining with calcein-AM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). After 24 hr of stimulation at 37°C, PAMs were labeled with calcein-AM (2.5 µM; Calbiochem) for 60 min at 37°C, fixed with 80% methanol (5 min, 4°C) and spun down onto glass slides using a cytospin. PAM nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) prior to imaging with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning-laser microscope.
All experiments were performed with at least three independent replicates. Data were analyzed with SPSS 16.0 and GraphPad Prism software (version 5.0) by Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Before investigating the effect of PAM polarization on PRRSV replication, the purity of our macrophage cultures was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and flow cytometry with anti-MAC387 antibody and anti-CD68 antibodies, respectively. As expected, green cytoplasmic staining was observed in a majority (>95%) of the cells. This finding was confirmed by flow cytometry, which showed that >90% of the cells were CD68-positive. This result demonstrated that our culture consisted almost entirely of PAMs (data not shown).
During our analyses, we noticed that cell morphology differed between the treated and control (M0) PAMs after 48 hr of stimulation. Interestingly, IFN-γ/LPS-treated M1 PAMs exhibited an elongated shape with a smaller nucleus in comparison to control and M2 macrophages (Fig. 1A) . Scanning electron microscopy showed IFN-γ/LPS-and IL-4-treated PAMs displayed numerous filopodia in comparison with M0 PAMs (Fig. 1B) .
To determine the optimal concentration and incubation time for LPS and IFN-γ co-treatment to induce M1 polarization, we used three combinations of LPS/IFN-γ at various concentrations (10 + 10, 100 + 50 and 1,000 + 100 ng/ml) and analyzed M1 marker expression at 6, 12, 24, 30, 36 and 48 hr post-stimulation. This experiment revealed that the mRNA expression of prototypical M1 markers including TNF-α (Tnf), IL-1β (Il1b), IL-6 (Il6) and IL-12 (Il12b) started to increase significantly at 6 hr after stimulation. Individually, the TNF-α level peaked at 6 hr followed by a rapid decline, whereas IL-1β and IL-6 peaked at 24 hr and then gradually decreased, and IL-12 peaked at 12 hr and remained upregulated throughout the analyzed time period (Fig. 2A) . Based on the results shown in Fig. 2A , we decided to use a co-treatment consisting of 100 ng/ml LPS and 50 ng/ml IFN-γ for 24 hr to induce M1 polarization in PAMs. Similarly, to determine the optimal stimulation for M2 PAMs, we used test concentrations of 10, 50 or 100 ng/ml for IL-4 with incubation periods of 6, 12, 24, 36 or 48 hr (Fig. 2B) and found that IL-4 treatment at 50 ng/ml for 24 hr caused the most robust M2 polarization.
To confirm the efficacy of our selected treatments for inducing M1 and M2 polarization, we examined the expression of other important M1 and M2 biomarkers by semi-quantitative PCR. Notably, we observed that IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, CCL2 and CXCL10 expression was significantly higher in LPS/IFN-γ-treated M1 macrophages than in control and IL4-stimulated counterparts (Fig. 3A) , whereas Arg-1, TGF-β, IL-10, Ym-1, PPAR-γ and STAT6 expression was markedly higher in IL-4-simulated M2 PAMs (Fig. 3B) .
Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an important factor expressed in M1 mouse macrophages that catalyzes the production of nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine substrate. Interestingly, no significant changes in NO concentrations were measured in the culture supernatants of M1, M2 and control macrophages (Fig. 3C) . These data demonstrate that, in contrast to mouse macrophages, iNOS is not a valuable indicator of M1 polarization in porcine macrophages, consistent with a previous study [15] . Moreover, M2 macrophages generally express high levels of arginase, an enzyme that catalyzes arginine into urea and ornithine. Accordingly, we found markedly higher urea concentrations in the supernatant of IL-4-stimulated PAMs when compared to control and M1 samples (Fig. 3C) .
Furthermore, we found a significant increase in the M2 genes IL-10 and Arg-1 in M2-polarized macrophages as compared to M0 and M1 PAMs (Fig. 3D) . Additionally, expression of M1 TLR4 and M2 Arg-1 was notably higher LPS/IFN-γ-and IL-4-stimulated PAM, respectively, when compared to control cells (Fig. 3E) . Collectively, these results indicate that treatment with LPS/IFN-γ or IL-4 potently induces M1 or M2 polarization in PAMs, respectively.
To investigate the effects of PAM polarization on HP-PRRSV replication, PAM cultures were treated with LPS/IFN-γ or IL-4 for 24 hr to induce macrophage polarization prior to infection with the HuN4-F5 strain of HP-PRRSV, which was derived from the wild, highly virulent strain HuN4 by 5 passages in MAC145 cells or left untreated (controls). IFA assays, anti-nucleocapsid protein (N protein) western blotting, qRT-PCR and viral titer analysis (TCID 50 ) showed that viral replication in control PAM progressively increased, peaked at 36 hr and then decreased until 48 hr post-infection (Fig. 4) . In contrast, HP-PRRSV replication was strongly inhibited in M1-type, but not M2-type PAMs (Fig. 4) . Based on western blot analysis, the relative viral suppression in M1-type PAMs ranged from 73% at 12 hr to 36% at 36 hr post-infection ( Fig. 4A and 4B) . Moreover, qRT-PCR (Fig. 4C) and TCID 50 assays (Fig. 4D ) also revealed a significant decrease in viral protein expression and infection rate in M1 macrophages when compared to M2 and control counterparts at 12, 24 and 36 hr postinfection. When M1-type cells were infected 48 hr after polarization, no inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication were observed, in comparison to M0-type and M2-type PAMs.
Using PAMs polarized in vitro, we also tested whether the replication of different PRRSV strains, including the HuN4-F2 strain of HP-PRRSV (derived from a wild, highly virulent strain HuN4 by 2 passages in MAC145 cells) and CH-1a strain of PRRSV (representative classic strain), was altered in cells with different activation status. PRRSV infection was monitored with IFA using a monoclonal antibody directed against the PRRSV N protein. Compared with untreated PAMs (M0-type), PAMs with LPS/IFN-γ stimulation (M1-type) showed a decreased cell population that was permissive to infection of both PRRSV strains. PAMs with IL-4 stimulation showed no significant change in the population of permissive cells (Fig. 5A and 5B ). In addition, to assess the replication abilities of different PRRSV strains in cells with different activation status, the RNA genome copy numbers for these two strains of PRRSV were determined using RT-PCR at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr after infection. The replication level of HuN4-F2 strains in M1-type PAMs was significantly lower than that in M0-type and M2-type PAMs at 12, 24 and 36 hr, but not 48 hr (Fig.  5C) ; and the replication level of Ch-1a strains in M1-type PAMs was significantly lower than that in M0-type and M2-type PAMs at 12 and 24 hr, but not 36 and 48 hr (Fig. 5D ). In summary, M1 polarization with LPS/IFN-γ also inhibits the replication of other PRRSV strains, such as the HuN4-F2 and CH-1a strains. 
Macrophages display remarkable plasticity and can change their physiology in response to environmental signals [11] . Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) are important lung tissue-resident professional phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APC) that play a central role in inflammation and host defense [23] . Therefore, it is necessary to understand the morphology, marker expression and cytokine secretion that clearly define PAM subsets. Our data show the PAM activation (LPS/IFN-γ or IL-4 stimulation) elicits a changed phenotype, altered expression pattern of certain markers and different antiviral regulation. This study should not only provide certain markers for determining the activation status of PAMs in vivo, but also contribute to understand antiviral immunity according to the activation status of PAMs.
Activation protocols have significant effects on macrophage morphology. Here, PAMs showed an elongated shape with a smaller nucleus after activation with LPS/IFN-γ, whereas activation by IL-4 appeared to result in more circular PAMs. This is in line with reports showing that the morphology of human macrophages changes with different maturation and activation methods in vitro [31] . A previous study showed that LPS/IFN-γ stimulation causes macrophages to stretch through cytoskeletal arrangements and modulates macrophage elasticity, which is a major determinant of innate macrophage functions such as phagocytosis [25] . These results suggest that LPS/IFN-γ increase phagocytosis through effects on macrophage elasticity (morphology).
Our results showed significantly higher IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, CCL2 and CXCL10 production by PAMs activated with LPS/IFN-γ stimulation. In contrast to M1-type macrophages, M2-type PAMs were characterized by the production of Arg-1, TGF-β, IL-10, Ym-1, PPAR-γ and STAT6. Overall, the specific production of these cytokines is consistent with reports for corresponding polarized murine macrophages. These data support the notion that PAMs are highly heterogeneous. Marker expression and cytokine production of PAMs are highly dependent on activation protocols. However, differences between species should be considered, e.g., there are no homologs of Ym1 and Fizz1 in humans [26] . A transcriptional analysis of PAMs polarized using LPS/IFN-γ or IL-4 stimulation needs to be performed to answer this question.
In the present study, we demonstrated that HP-PRRSV replication was significantly impaired in M1 PAMs. Several studies have confirmed that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection is restricted through down-regulation of CD4 at the cell surface and up-regulation of the secretion of CCR5-binding chemokines (CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5) in M1-type macrophage [3] . PAMs are the primary cellular target for receptor-mediated PRRSV infection via sialoadhesin (SN), heparan sulfate (HS) and CD163 [7] . Thus, we theorized that the observed effect on PRRSV replication in M1 macrophages results from the decreased expression of viral receptors on the PAM surface. Although no significant change in HS expression was found between the two polarized subtypes compared with the control, SN and CD163 expression was markedly increased with the expression of SN in M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively (data not shown), thereby demonstrating that the diminished HP-PRRSV replication in M1 PAMs is not associated with viral receptor expression. In addition, the important feature of M1-type macrophages is that they activate host defense programs against invading pathogens, such as HIV-1, through up-regulation of several host restriction factors, e.g. APOBEC-3G and sterile alpha motif and HD domain (SAMHD)-1. It has been reported that SAMHD-1 inhibits HP-PRRSV replication by interfering with the synthesis viral genome cRNA in MARC-145 cells [33] . However, when M1-type cells were infected 48 hr after polarization in the present study, no inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication were observed. To some extent, the phenotype of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can be reversed in vitro and in vivo [12, 28] . Indeed, our unpublished data demonstrated that M0-/M1-type PAMs were re-polarized to the M2 type as a result of HP-PRRSV infection. These findings strongly suggest that HP-PRRSV infection can modulate macrophage polarization and might be the reason why M1-type PAMs did not restrict PRRSV at 48 hr after infection.
In conclusion, we established a PAM polarization model in vitro and confirmed similarities in cytokine expression as previously observed in mouse and human macrophages. Notably, we show that PRRSV replication is significantly impaired by M1-polarized ",Porcine alveolar macrophage polarization is involved in inhibition of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication,"WANG, Longtao; HU, Shouping; LIU, Qiang; LI, Yiru; XU, Lu; ZHANG, Zhuo; CAI, Xuehui; HE, Xijun",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5709573/,243,3520,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to engage in drug addiction. Objective: Whether lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) attended to morphine-mediated autophagy of mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was probed. Materials and methods: HT22 cells were subjected to 10 mM morphine for 24 h. Cell autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expression. qRT-PCR was carried out to measure MEG3 expression. SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) was transfected to silence MEG3. The orexin1 receptor (OX1R), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions were tested by western blotting. SCH772984 was used as an inhibitor of ERK pathway. Results: Morphine elevated OX1R (2.92 times), c-fos (2.06 times), p/t-ERK (2.04 times) and p/t-PKC (2.4 times), Beclin-1 (3.2 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (3.96 times) expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, followed by morphine exposure, the MEG3 expression was also elevated in HT22 cells (3.03 times). The silence of MEG3 lowered the Beclin-1 (1.85 times), LC3-II/LC3-I (2.12 times), c-fos (1.39 times) and p/t-ERK (1.44 times) expressions in morphine-treated HT22 cells. Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphine-caused Beclin-1 (1.97 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (1.92 times) expressions decreases. Conclusions: Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation. More experiments are also needed in the future to analyse the influence of other lncRNAs in drug addiction.
ARTICLE HISTORY","Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing neuropsychiatric disease manifested by uncontrolled drug-seeking and drug-taking (Yager et al. 2015; Koskela et al. 2017) . It can be comprehended as a neuropathological process caused by drug stimulation, results in the construction of obsessive drug-seeking behaviour (Robbins and Everitt 2002) . Due to the molecular mechanism related to drug addiction is very complex and mysterious (Kenny 2014; Sun et al. 2016) , it believes that studying the biological mechanism of drug addiction is of great significance for the treatment and intervention of drug addiction.
Morphine is a very effective opiate analgesic drug widely used to ease both acute and chronic pain (Du 2018) . However, morphine has become a commonly abused recreational drug due to its widespread availability and a high potential for addiction (Kim et al. 2016) . Researching the pathogenesis of morphine addiction can provide new ideas and theoretical basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of opioid addiction and clinical treatment. Earlier experimental studies have indicated that neuronal cell mitochondrial dysfunction happens in morphine addiction process, which in turn induces cell autophagy (Lixia et al. 2010; Cai et al. 2016; Su et al. 2017) . Su et al. (2017) reported that compared to wild-type mice, mice specific knockout of autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) and Atg7 in dopaminergic neurons had lower sensitivities to constructing morphine-induced addictive behaviours. Orexin1 receptor (OX1R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor in central nervous system, which contributed to the establishment of morphine addiction (Baimel et al. 2015) . c-fos is a proto-oncogene that expressed in central neurons after adverse stimulation (Dziopa et al. 2011) . Studies in rats revealed that cfos protein took part in the neurobiological responses to morphine in dopamine neurons (Dziopa et al. 2011) . Besides, both ERK and PKC pathways have been found to participate in the morphine-mediated drug addiction Pena et al. 2018) .
It is well known that not all genes in cells transcribed into mRNAs, some of them also transcribed into long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Jarroux et al. 2017) . As a class of regulatory RNAs, lncRNAs have been discovered to engage in the modulation of numerous biological processes (Quinn and Chang 2016) . Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is an lncRNA that attends to the modulation of cell autophagy (Pawar et al. 2016 ).
However, most of the current studies only focus on the roles of MEG3 in cancer cell autophagy (Xia et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018) . Whether MEG3 engages in the morphine-caused neuronal cell autophagy remains unclear.
Herein, mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells were exposed to morphine stimulation. The OX1R, c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions in HT22 cells, along with the HT22 cell autophagy were tested. What's more, the MEG3 expression, as well as the influence of MEG3 up-regulation on morphinecaused HT22 cell autophagy were probed. We believe that the outcomes of our research will offer experimental basis for comprehending the influence of lncRNAs on morphine-mediated drug addiction. Morphine solution was received from Sigma-Aldrich (M-005, St. Louis, MO, USA). HT22 cells were exposed to 10 mM morphine for 24 h in our experiments. SCH772984 was received from MedChem Express (HY-50846, NJ, USA). 50 mM SCH772984 was added into the culture medium of HT22 cells to inhibit the ERK pathway.
SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) and siRNA negative control (si-NC) were received from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and transfected into HT22 cells with the help of Lipofectamine TM 3000 Transfection Reagent (L3000-008, Invitrogen).
The MEG3 expression in HT22 cells was tested by qRT-PCR. Total RNAs were separated by RNAiso Plus (9108, Takara Biomedical Technology, Beijing, China). The cDNA was synthesized with the help of PrimeScript cDNA Synthesis kit (6210, Takara Biomedical Technology). Then, the MEG3 expression was measured by TaqMan Non-coding RNA assay (4426961, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and compared to b-actin expression. Results were calculated using 2 À᭝᭝Ct method (Ish-Shalom and Lichter 2010).
Total proteins were separated from HT22 cells with the help of Cell Lysis Buffers (635656, Takara Biomedical Technology) including Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-ProteoGuard (635672, Takara Biomedical Technology). The concentration of total proteins was tested by TaKaRa CBA Protein Assay kit (T9300A, Takara Biomedical Technology). Then, proteins were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (03010040001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Anti-OX1R antibody (sc-166111), anti-c-fos antibody (sc-271243), anti-t-ERK antibody (sc-514302), anti-p-ERK antibody (sc-81492), anti-t-PKC antibody (sc-8393), anti-p-PKC antibody (sc-377565), anti-Beclin-1 antibody (sc-48341), anti-LC3 antibody (sc-271625) and anti-b-actin antibody (sc-47778) were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). PVDF membrane was incubated with primary antibodies for 12 h at 4 C. Subsequently, the PVDF membrane was incubated with Goat anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse) IgG-HRP (sc-2004, sc-2005) for 1 h at 20-25 C. After that, the PVDF membrane was placed into the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc TM XRS system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and coated with Pierce TM ECL Western Blotting (32109, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The signals of proteins were recorded and the intensities of bands were calculated with the help of Image Lab TM software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was carried out for statistical analysis. Results were represented as mean ± SD from three repeated experiments. p-Values were calculated via Student's t-test or ANOVA. Significant difference was set as p ˂ 0.05.
Firstly, HT22 cells were exposed to 10 mM morphine for 24 h. The OX1R, c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expression were tested. Data in Figure 1 (A) showed that 10 mM morphine exposure dramatically elevated the OX1R protein level in HT22 cells (p ˂ 0.01). The c-fos protein level in HT22 cells was also increased after 10 mM morphine exposure (Figure 1(B) , p ˂ 0.01). Moreover, 10 mM morphine exposure notably enhanced the p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expression rates in HT22 cells (Figure 1 (C), p ˂ 0.05 or p ˂ 0.01). These outcomes illustrated that morphine could elevate OX1R and c-fos expression and activate ERK and PKC pathways in HT22 cells.
Then, followed by 10 mM morphine exposure, the Beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I expression in HT22 cells were tested to assess cell autophagy. As displayed in Figure 2 , 10 mM morphine exposure significantly elevated the Beclin-1 protein level and LC3-II/LC3-I expression rate in HT22 cells (p ˂ 0.01), which illustrated that morphine could promote HT22 cell autophagy.
The MEG3 expression in HT22 cells after 10 mM morphine exposure was also measured. Result in Figure 3 presented that 10 mM morphine exposure noticeably enhanced the MEG3 expression in HT22 cells (p ˂ 0.01), which implied that up-regulation of MEG3 caused by morphine might be associated with the influences of morphine on HT22 cell autophagy, as well as elevation of OX1R, c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expression.
In order to probe the influence of MEG3 up-regulation on morphine-caused HT22 cell autophagy, si-MEG3 was transfected into HT22 cells. Figure 4(A) showed that the MEG3 expression in HT22 cells was dramatically declined by si-MEG3 transfection (p ˂ 0.01). By contract with morphine þ si-NC group, the Beclin-1 protein level and LC3-II/LC3-I expression rate in HT22 cells were both lowered in morphine þ si-MEG3 group (Figure 4(B) , p ˂ 0.05 or p ˂ 0.01). These outcomes illustrated that upregulation of MEG3 attended to the influence of morphine on HT22 cell autophagy.
Further experiments were carried out to investigate whether MEG3 took part in the morphine-caused elevations of OX1R, cfos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expression in HT22 cells. Data in Figure 5 (A) presented that there was no significant difference of OX1R protein level in morphine þ si-NC group and morphine þ si-MEG3 group. Figure 5 (B) displayed that morphine-caused elevation of c-fos expression was notably weakened by si-MEG3 transfection (p ˂ 0.05). Besides, morphine-caused enhancement of p/t-ERK expression in HT22 cells was remarkably mitigated by si-MEG3 transfection ( Figure 5(C) , p ˂ 0.05), while the p/t-PKC expression in HT22 cells was not changed between transfection with si-NC and transfection with si-MEG3. These outcomes illustrated that up-regulation of MEG3 also took part in the influences of morphine on c-fos and p/t-ERK expressions in HT22 cells.
Finally, the inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 was added into experiment to analyse the roles of ERK pathway in morphine-caused HT22 cell autophagy. Figure 6 showed that 50 mM SCH772984 incubation significantly declined the Beclin-1 protein level and LC3-II/LC3-I expression rate in morphine-treated HT22 cells (p ˂ 0.01), which illustrated that ERK pathway played important role in HT22 cell autophagy. In addition, by contrast with morphine þ si-MEG3 group, the Beclin-1 protein level and LC3-II/LC3-I expression rate in HT22 cells were further declined in morphine þ si-MEG3 group þ SCH772984 group (p ˂ 0.05), which illustrated that up-regulation of MEG3 took part in the influence of morphine on HT22 cell autophagy might be achieved by promoting ERK pathway activation.
Some lncRNAs have been found to engage in neuroplasticity via modulating protein dynamics in the synapse (Sartor et al. 2012; Bohnsack et al. 2019) . Given that addiction can be regarded as a process of synaptic plasticity (Luscher and Malenka 2011) , it is worthy believing that identifying the roles of lncRNAs in this process will provide novel insights for addiction research. In the current research, we further confirmed the influences of morphine on OX1R, c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions in mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells, as well as HT22 cell autophagy. We proposed that morphine-stimulated HT22 cells could be utilized as an in vitro cell model of drug addiction.
More importantly, we discovered that morphine elevated the MEG3 expression in HT22 cells. Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the influence of morphine on HT22 cell autophagy might be achieved by promoting ERK pathway activation.
Morphine is one of the most abundant alkaloids isolated from the poppy plants (Du 2018) . Although morphine has strong analgesic activity, the addiction of morphine also is a very serious social issue (Kim et al. 2016; Antolak et al. 2017 ). Many efforts have been made to explore the molecular basis of morphine addiction and some molecules and cellular biological processes have been found. OX1R, c-fos, ERK and PKC pathways are all discovered to join in morphine addiction. For example, Erami et al. (2012) reported that suppression of OX1R decreased the progress of morphine tolerance and physical dependence in rats. Siahposht-Khachaki et al. (2018) indicated that exposure to morphine produced an elevation of c-fos expression in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of Wistar rats. In addition, Liu et al. (2016) illustrated that ERK pathway contributed to the maintenance of morphine-mediated memory in hippocampus. Pena et al. (2018) pointed out that followed by morphine stimulation, PKC pathway in mouse neuroblastoma cells was activated. As an intracellular protein self-degradation Figure 2 . Morphine promoted HT22 cell autophagy. HT22 cells were exposed to 10 mM morphine for 24 h. The Beclin-1 and LC3 protein levels were tested by western blotting. ÃÃ p ˂ 0.01. process capable of upholding cellular metabolism, cell autophagy also has been demonstrated to take part in morphine-mediated drug addiction (Lixia et al. 2010; Su et al. 2017 ). In the cell autophagy process, the LC3-I binds to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II, which joins in the formation of autophagosome membranes (Pugsley 2017) . Beclin-1, also known as Atg6, is a key regulator of cell autophagy (Booth et al. 2014) . Herein, we found that the OX1R, c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions in HT22 cells were all increased after morphine stimulation. The LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expressions were also elevated in HT22 cells after morphine stimulation. Therefore, we proposed that morphine-stimulated HT22 cells could be utilized as an in vitro cell model of morphine addiction to explore the influence of MEG3 on morphine addiction.
Previous studies reported that the expression of several lncRNAs were changed in the brains of addicted humans (Michelhaugh et al. 2011; Feng and Nestler 2013) . What's more, some lncRNAs have been demonstrated to contribute to neuroplasticity (Sartor et al. 2012; Bohnsack et al. 2019 ). These findings provide great motivation for studying the influences of lncRNAs on drug addiction. MEG3 has been proved to take part in the modulation of cell autophagy, especially in brain cells (Xu et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018) . Su et al. (2019) indicated that MEG3 might participate in the methamphetamine-mediated addiction in mice. In this study, we discovered that morphine exposure elevated the MEG3 expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, the silence of MEG3 relieved the morphine-stimulated HT22 cell autophagy through declining the Beclin-1 and LC3-II/ LC3-I expressions. Besides, we also discovered that the silence of MEG3 lowered the c-fos and p/t-ERK expressions in morphinetreated HT22 cells, but had no significant influence on OX1R and p/t-PKC expressions. Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphinecaused HT22 cell autophagy. Considering that c-fos and ERK pathway also have been found to join in the regulation of cell autophagy (Wu et al. 2018; Fung and Liu 2019) , the findings of our research suggested that up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the influence of morphine on HT22 cell autophagy might be achieved by elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation.
Taken together, the influence of MEG3 on morphine-mediated mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cell autophagy was investigated in this research. Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation. We propose that not only one lncRNA, MEG3, take part in the morphine-mediated drug addiction. More experiments are also needed in the future to analyse the influence of other lncRNAs in drug addiction.

94,657558034931a24e09f761877fed36cb70f4f6fe,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); manifestations of the disease are diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. Starting from the end of 2010, a PED outbreak occurred in several pig-producing provinces in southern China. Subsequently, the disease spread throughout the country and caused enormous economic losses to the pork industry. Accumulating studies demonstrated that new PEDV variants that appeared in China were responsible for the PED outbreak. In the current mini-review, we summarize PEDV epidemiology and vaccination in China.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. PEDV infections can occur in pigs of all ages, and infections are most serious in piglets, with morbidity and mortality often reaching 100% [9, 40] . Pigs that tolerate PEDV infections usually exhibit growth retardation, reduced food conversion rates, increased feeding costs and the co-occurrence of other diseases. Furthermore, PEDV infections result in reduced pig slaughter rates, insufficient pork supplies and pork price instability, because of a large number of piglet deaths.
PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and genus Alphacoronavirus. In 1971, the first reported PED outbreak occurred in pig populations in England, and PEDV was confirmed to cause PED in 1978 [30] . Thus far, PED has been reported in swine-farming countries in Asia, Europe, North America [7, 17, 20, 29, 32] . In 1973, an acute diarrheal disease similar to swine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) was first reported in Shanghai, China; however, the causative agent of this disease was not confirmed to be PEDV until 1984 [41] . From 1984 to early 2010, PEDV infections occurred in the pig population in China, but there were no large-scale outbreaks [3, 6] . Starting from the end of 2010, PEDV outbreaks occurred in the Chinese pig population and caused enormous economic losses [1, 2, 4, 20, 22, 42] . Because of the severity of PED, extensive, in-depth studies of PEDV have been performed during the past five years in China.
Since 1966, the occurrence of pig diarrheal disease has been recorded in China. The disease showed a local endemic tendency with significant seasonal variations, usually occurring from the end of October to early February, and PEDV was confirmed to be the cause of such outbreaks in 1984 [43] . After PEDV infections in the pig population were confirmed, a series of investigations of PED occurrence were conducted in China. Ji et al. (1987) reported that in farms with PEDV outbreaks, the PEDV incidence was 80% in sows, 100% in suckling pigs and 90% in fattening pigs [18] . Wang et al. (1989) reported that among cases of PED in 1989, the PEDV incidence was 95% in fattening pigs, 60.4% in sows, 78.95% in boars and 100% in suckling pigs (with a mortality rate of 87.9%) [39] . These data suggest that PEDV infections were present in the pig population in China during PED occurred in Europe. However, before 2010, PEDV infections were mostly sporadic or locally endemic, with no large-scale outbreaks in China.
After the PEDV outbreaks in 2010, detailed studies of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of PEDV were conducted in China, which led to the accumulation of a large amount of data (Table 1) . From February 2011 to March 2014, a long-term investigation showed that PEDV was circulating in 29 provinces in China, excluding Tibet and Hainan (Fig. 1A) ; the positive rates of samples varied from 61.10% to 78.49%, and the positive rates of pig farms varied from 71.43% to 83.47% (Fig. 1B) [10, 45] . The positive rates of PEDV in samples or farms were significantly [20] higher compared with earlier PEDV outbreaks in China and other countries. In addition to the PEDV, swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine rotavirus, porcine kobuvirus, porcine bocavirus, porcine enterovirus, porcine teschovirus, Lawsonia intracellularis and porcine deltacoronavirus have also been found in diarrhea samples from pigs [10, 12, 44] . These data demonstrated that PED occurred extensively among the pig population in China and that PEDV was the major cause of viral diarrheal diseases in swine during the recent outbreaks. However, co-infections of other intestinal pathogens with PEDV should also be monitored dynamically in future studies in China. The S1 regions of the spike (S) protein-encoding gene of 99 selected PEDV strains were divided into two groups (GI and GII) in a phylogenetic tree. The GI group consists of two subgroups (GIa and GIb), while the GII group also consists of two subgroups (GIIa and GIIb) (Fig. 2 ). Ten Chinese PEDV strains isolated from 2004 to 2015, which exhibited Several reports indicated that for PEDV field strains, the neutralizing epitopes of the major antigenic protein, the S protein, showed high conservation and were highly similar to that of the vaccine strain CV777 [2, 15, 33] . These data suggest that in China, the traditional PEDV vaccine strain (CV777) still could prevent infections by PEDV field strains and provide effective cross-protection. However, the protective effect of the PEDV vaccine needs to be dynamically monitored in future due to the increasing trend of PEDV variants in China.
Recombination of the S gene of coronaviruses has been frequently reported [24, 31] . The PEDV S protein binds to a host cell receptor and triggers fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. It is likely that PEDV variants will continue to emerge, because of naturally occurring recombination events and mutations in the S gene. To identify possible recombination events within the S gene of PEDV, the S1 regions of 65 selected S genes from Chinese PEDV strains isolated from 2004 to 2015 (see Fig. 2 ) were screened using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP), GENECONV, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, 3Seq, PhylPro, LARD and SISscan methods embedded in RDP4. The recombination analysis revealed that four potential recombination events occurred between the 65 PEDV strains from China (Table 2) , and confirmation of the four potential recombination events was carried out by bootscan analysis and fast neighbor-joining trees, respectively (Fig. 3) . Of the four potential recombination events, one potential recombinant event occurred between a GI group strain and a GII group strain, and three potential recombinant events occurred within GI group strains. Most of the GI group Chinese strains consisted of PEDV strains that emerged from 2011 to 2015. The limited data demonstrated that recently emerging PEDV strains in China exhibited high variability and potential recombination of the S gene. In summary, although the evidence of naturally occurring recombination events is limited, possible recombination events between the S genes of Chinese PEDV strains should be monitored by extensive molecular epidemiology investigations in the future.
Conventional vaccine: Wang et al. reported that a tissueinactivated PEDV vaccine was prepared using PEDV strain S [38] . Through Houhai acupoint immunization, the active immunization protection rate of the prepared PEDV tissueinactivated vaccine in three-day-old piglets was 77.28%, and the passive immunization protection rate was 97.06%, while the immunization protection period was six months. Improving the tissue-inactivated PEDV vaccine involves a complicated preparation process, high production cost, high time requirement and quality control problems. Ma et al. adapted PEDV strain CV777 to Vero cells and successfully performed continuous passages by adding trypsin to the culture medium [27] . An inactivated PEDV vaccine was prepared using the cultures of 28th passage viruses [27] . Through Houhai acupoint immunization, the active immunization protection rate in piglets was 85.19%, and the passive immunization protection rate was 85.0%. However, inactivated PEDV vaccines still exhibited some limitations, including the need for high immunization doses and multiple booster immunizations, as well as short immunity durations. Tong et al. reported that an attenuated PEDV vaccine strain (a 90th generation cloned virus strain) was successfully prepared by serial passage in vitro [36] . Through Houhai acupoint immunization, the attenuated PEDV vaccine had a 95.52% active immunization protection rate and a 96.2% passive immunization protection rate in three-to six-day-old piglets.
On the basis of inactivated PEDV cell cultures, Ma et al. prepared an inactivated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine [26] . Tong et al. prepared an attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine based on the attenuated PEDV vaccine [37] . The inactivated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (1999 to present) and the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) are extensively used in the Chinese pig population, and they play important roles in the control of TGEV and PEDV infections. After the outbreak of PED at the end of 2010, there was a renewed demand for live vaccines that could effectively prevent viral diarrhea diseases of swine. Based on the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine, Feng et al. prepared a trivalent TGEV, PEDV and PRoV (G5 type) live vaccine (consisting of an attenuated H strain, an attenuated CV777 strain and the attenuated NX strain), which was licensed on December 31, 2014, by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture. The results of vaccine clinical trials showed that the immunization protection rate was over 95%, and the incidence of viral diarrheal diseases of swine in experimental farms was reduced from 8-12% to 3-5% [5] . In the future, the TGEV, PEDV and PRoV trivalent live vaccine will serve as an effective tool for the control of viral diarrheal diseases of swine in China, especially PEDV infections.
Genetically engineered vaccines: Mucosal immunity plays an important role in the immune mechanism of viral diarrheal diseases. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies secreted by the intestinal mucosa can defend against invading pathogens. Oral vaccines can stimulate mucosal immunity and produce protective mucosal and serum IgA antibodies, and they are an effective method for prevention of intestinal infectious diseases. For PEDV oral vaccines, Hou et al. reported that lactic acid bacteria expressing the PEDV N protein could activate the production of mucosal IgA and circulating IgG antibodies against the PEDV N protein [16] . Ge et al. reported that recombinant lactobacilli expressing * Group was defined based on the phylogenetic tree of S1 gene of the selected PEDV strains in our study (see Fig. 2 ).
the N protein and the core neutralizing epitope (COE) could stimulate the intestines to produce local immune responses, as well as systemic immune responses, after oral immunization [13, 14] . Liu et al. constructed recombinant lactobacilli expressing the PEDV N gene or the S1 region of the S gene, and an oral inoculation showed that lactobacilli expressing the N protein could enhance the mucosal and systemic immune responses mediated by recombinant lactobacilli expressing the S1 fragment of the S protein [25] . The S protein of PEDV is a peplomer glycoprotein that is located on the surface of viral particles, and it can mediate the production of neutralizing antibodies; therefore, it is a target for vaccine research. However, the S protein is a highly glycosylated protein, and in vitro expression of recombinant S protein usually results in the loss of immunogenicity. To produce a highly effective PEDV vaccine, Meng et al. used a eukaryotic expression vector to construct a DNA vaccine expressing the PEDV S gene. This vaccine was able to effectively activate cell-mediated immunity and mediate the production of high levels of antibodies in immunized animals [28] . Liang et al. used a eukaryotic expression vector to construct a recombinant plasmid expressing the S1 region of the PEDV S gene, and they further constructed an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain that carried a recombinant plasmid expressing the S1 region of the S gene [23] . Currently, although PEDV oral vaccines and DNA vaccines are still at the research stage and have not been applied in Chinese pig populations, these studies have broadened our understanding of PEDV vaccines, and they have provided a foundation for the future development of highly effective PEDV vaccines.
Recently, a large number of studies of PEDV have provided an in-depth understanding of PEDV infections in the pig population in China. In particular, a trivalent live vaccine for viral diarrheal diseases of swine has been authorized for (b) Fast neighbor-joining (NJ) tree (1,000 replicates, Kimura two-parameter distance) constructed using the recombinant region of each potential recombinant event; (c) Fast neighbor-joining (NJ) tree (1,000 replicates, Kimura two-parameter distance) constructed using the non-recombinant region of each potential recombinant event.
use, and it is a powerful tool for the control of PED. However, virus variability and co-infections of PEDV with other enteric viruses are unpredictable. These factors make it difficult to understand and control PEDV infections. Therefore, future work should continue to trace the variability of PEDV strains and co-infections of other enteric viruses, improve PEDV vaccines using variant strains as candidates and elucidate the pathogenicity of PEDV variant strains.",Epidemiology and vaccine of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in China: a mini-review,"SUN, Dongbo; WANG, Xinyu; WEI, Shan; CHEN, Jianfei; FENG, Li",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4829501/,87,2032,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,57b88add1645a89614742dc32b0e11922c5f37d2,"Recent evidence has confirmed that a mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene occurs early in gliomagenesis and contributes to suppressed immunity. The present study aimed to determine the candidate genes associated with IDH mutation status that could serve as biomarkers of immune suppression for improved prognosis prediction. Clinical information and RNA-seq gene expression data were collected for 932 glioma samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases, and differentially expressed genes in both lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) samples were identified according to IDH mutation status. Only one gene, interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20), with reduced expression in IDH mutant tumors, demonstrated significant prognostic value. ISG20 expression level significantly increased with increasing tumor grade, and its high expression was associated with a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, increased ISG20 expression was associated with increased infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils, and suppressed adaptive immune response. ISG20 expression was also positively correlated with PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 expression, along with the levels of several chemokines. We conclude that ISG20 is a useful biomarker to identify IDH-mediated immune processes in glioma and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.
ARTICLE HISTORY","Glioma is the most common and lethal type of malignancy in the primary central nervous system (CNS). 1 Although patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs) have a more favorable prognosis than those with glioblastomas (GBMs), many tend to progress to a higher grade, leading to poor survival. 2 Nevertheless, the outcome of glioma patients is highly variable, even among those with the same tumor grade. 3 Recent analyses demonstrated that an IDH1/2 mutation, encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene, occurs early in gliomagenesis, affecting a common glial precursor cell population. 4 Patients with tumors harboring an IDH1/2 mutation (IDHmut) show significantly longer survival than those expressing wild-type IDH1/2 (IDHwt). [5] [6] [7] IDH mutation leads to a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) by modulating the methylation patterns on a genome-wide scale, changing transcriptional programs and altering the differentiation state. 8 CIMP is associated with microsatellite instability and longer survival in several cancers. 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] IDHmut and IDHwt tumors differ with regards to various biological processes, including immune cell infiltration. [14] [15] [16] [17] Human IDH1-mutant gliomas have less infiltrating immune cells than IDH1-wild type gliomas, with global depletion of immune infiltrates, including microglia, macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells. Accordingly, early IDHmut glioma progenitor cells have suppressed immunity compared with IDHwt cells, 4, 15, 18 which may be responsible for their improved clinical outcomes. 15 Moreover, IDHmut tumors have reduced expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated genes and interferon (IFN)-γ-inducible chemokines, as well as suppressed accumulation of T cells in the tumor compared with IDHwt tumors. 16 IDHwt gliomas are also characterized by more prominent regulatory T cell infiltration and higher programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels than IDHmut cases. 17 Although IDH status clearly appears to affect the immune state and progression of glioma, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To elucidate these mechanisms and identify the candidate prognostic and/or therapeutic markers, we investigated the differential expression of immune-related genes and their role in glioma progression. In particular, we collected clinical and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases, including 932 glioma samples. We then determined the differentially expressed immune-related genes according to IDH mutation status, analyzed separately for LGG and GBM cases, and performed pathway enrichment analysis for functional annotation.
To identify the differentially expressed immune-related genes according to IDH status, we compared their expression levels between IDHwt and IDHmut tumors. Genes were analyzed in four groups: LGG in the CGGA database (CGGA-LGG), GBM in the CGGA database (CGGA-GBM), LGG in the TCGA database (TCGA-LGG), and GBM in the TCGA database (TCGA-GBM). Twelve genes with upregulated expression in IDHmut gliomas and 71 genes with upregulated expression in IDHwt tumors were found to be significant across all four cohorts ( Figure 1 , Table S1 ). The prognostic value of these genes was further evaluated (Table S2) . Only one gene, ISG20, with up-regulated expression in IDHwt tumors, was found to have a consistently significant influence on patient survival across all groups.
High ISG20 expression is related to higher tumor malignancy in glioma
To further investigate the clinical significance of ISG20 in glioma, we analyzed the expression of ISG20 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and molecular subtypes. We found that ISG20 expression level increased with increasing tumor grade (Figure 2(a); Fig. S1A ). The mesenchymal subtype of GBM showed the highest ISG20 expression level compared with the other subtypes, whereas the proneural subtype had the lowest ISG20 level (Figure 2 (b); Fig. S1B ). Moreover, ISG20 expression was up-regulated in 1p/ 19q-non-co-deleted gliomas compared with those with 1p/19qco-deletion (Figure 2(c); Fig. S1C ). In addition, ISG20 expression was significantly higher in IDHwt tumors compared with IDHmut tumors across all tumor grades (Figure 2 (d-f), Fig. S1D-F) . Overall, these results suggest that ISG20 expression is suppressed in IDH mutant tumors and is associated with higher tumor malignancy.
To further determine the prognostic value of ISG20, we carried out Cox regression analyses in the CGGA and TCGA databases, respectively. In the CGGA database, ISG20 emerged as an independent prognostic factor of patient survival (hazard ratio = 1.058, 95%CI = 1.024-1.093, p = 0.001), independent of age, tumor grade, chemo-and radiation Figure 1 . Numbers of differentially expressed genes according to IDH status in four groups of samples. Genes were analyzed in four cohorts: low-grade gliomas in CGGA cohort (CGGA LGGs), glioblastomas in CGGA cohort (CGGA GBMs), low-grade gliomas in TCGA cohort (TCGA LGGs), and glioblastomas in TCGA cohort (TCGA GBMs). Genes that were both significant in Student's t-test (p < 0.05) and SAM (FDR < 0.01) were counted. Each digit represents the number of significantly upregulated genes in the corresponding group. The overlapped genes across four groups were selected for further survival analysis. therapy, IDH mutation, 1p19q-co-deletion status, and MGMT promoter methylation (Table 1) . Analysis in TCGA database showed the same result (hazard ratio = 1.250, 95%CI = 1.070-1.460, p = 0.005, Table 1 ). The samples were further stratified based on IDH status and tumor grades. As shown in Figure 3 and Fig. S2 , high ISG20 expression (i.e. higher than the median ISG20 level) was associated with shorter patient survival across all subgroups, except for grade II glioma (Figure 3, Fig. S2 ).
To examine the consistency of ISG20 protein expression with gene expression findings, we used immunohistochemistry and measured ISG20 expression in tumor specimens from 43 glioma patients. In line with the results from the bioinformatics analyses, protein expression of ISG20 showed the same results, with increased expression in higher tumor grade and decreased expression in IDH mutant tumors. Representative immunohistochemical staining of ISG20 in gliomas is also illustrated (Figure 2 (e,f). 
To better understand the mechanism of ISG20-promoted glioma progression, we determined the genes showing correlated expression with ISG20 among the whole transcriptome. Among the total 21,468 genes analyzed, 570 genes in the CGGA and 1925 genes in TCGA showed significant correlations with ISG20 expression (r > 0.5, Table S3 ). Subsequent pathway analyses showed that these genes were involved in a wide variety of immune responses, including innate immune response, T cell activation, inflammatory response, antigen processing and presentation, hematopoietic cell lineage, leukocyte migration, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, lysosome activation, and type I and II IFN signaling pathway (Figure 4; Fig. S3A ). ISG20 also appears to be involved in essential metabolic pathways, such as the regulation of protein processing and modification, proteasome synthesis, and galactose metabolism (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicated that ISG20 is highly involved with the immune response in the glioma microenvironment.
To validate this hypothesis, we further investigated which pathways were associated with ISG20 expression. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) highlighted that the high expression of ISG20 was significantly enriched in multiple immune processes, especially in innate immunity (Fig S3B;  Table S4 ). The correlationship of ISG20 expression with the above immune processes was further validated in detail using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA; Fig S3C ; Table S4 ).
To further explore the connection of ISG20 and immunity in the local tumor microenvironment, we performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and analyzed the enrichment scores of various immune cell-characterized gene sets in ISG20-associated genes. We found that as the ISG20 expression level increases, the numbers of macrophages and neutrophils that infiltrates the tumor also rise, while the numbers of central memory T cells (Tcm), follicular helper T cells (Tfh), effector memory T cells (Tem), and gamma delta T cells (Tgd) decreased ( Figure 5(a); Fig. S4A ). However, NK cells, CD4 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells were not correlated with ISG20 expression. Mutual relationship analysis of ISG20related immune cells was further conducted to identify their clusters according to the extent of ISG20 expression ( Figure 5  (b), Fig. S4B ), demonstrating that macrophages and neutrophils were tightly correlated, both of which were positively correlated with ISG20 expression; while subsets of T cells were correlated with each other, and were negatively correlated with ISG20 levels.
To further confirm these initial findings, we next studied the intratumoral immune cell infiltrates from 43 glioma patients with immunostaining and compared their immune cell profiles relative to ISG20 expression ( Figure 5(c,d) ). In line with the bioinformatic findings, the composition of the immune infiltrates differed between the low ISG20 expression group and the high ISG20 expression group, with a more substantial number of macrophages and lower number of the T cell subsets (T cells, Tfh cells, memory T cells) in high ISG20 expression tumors. Moreover, microglia and cytotoxic T cells were not associated with the ISG20 protein level.
We also investigated the association of ISG20 and chemokine levels in the tumor. As expected, the ISG20 expression level increased in parallel with the levels of many chemokines, including CCL2, CCL5, CCL23, CCL26, CCR1, CCR2, CCR7, CCRL2, CXCL16, CXCR4, and CXCR6 (r > 0.4, p < 0.05; data not shown).
Since PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 are important immune inhibitory molecules, we further determined the association of ISG20 expression with these levels. We found that PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 expression levels increased in parallel with increasing ISG20 levels (r > 0.45; p < 0.0001) (Fig. S5 ).
Mounting evidence suggests that glioma with an IDH mutation has suppressed immunity. 16 Inflammation may promote the proliferation and survival of malignant cells and metastasis, contribute to overturning adaptive immunity, and change tumor responses to chemotherapeutic agents. 19 A large proportion of the glioma tumor microenvironment consists of an inflammatory infiltrate predominated by macrophages, which are thought to be subverted by glioblastoma cells for tumor growth. 20, 21 In gliomas, IDHwt tumors are associated with infiltration of more immune-related components, contributing to poor survival. However, the associated molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood, and thus more extensive research in this area could provide insight toward improved diagnosis and treatment. [22] [23] [24] [25] Toward this end, we have identified that ISG20 may play a key role in mediating the IDH-related immune response in the glioma microenvironment. The ISG20 gene, located at chromosome 15q26.1, encodes a 20-kDa protein. It was first introduced in 1997 by Celine Gongora and colleagues as an IFN-induced promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB)-associated protein. 26 PML-NB is reported to be extensively involved in oncogenesis and gene transcription, [27] [28] [29] and the function differs according to its binding protein. [30] [31] [32] [33] The endogenous ISG20 protein is present both in the nucleolus and in the Cajal bodies, and participates in the maturation of small nucleolar RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, and in ribosome biogenesis, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] leading to the control of RNA stability. 40,41 ISG20 can be induced by type I and type II IFNs, 42,43 and its expression has been shown to be elevated during infection [44] [45] [46] and in several types of cancers. 33, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] However, the exact function and mechanism of action of this protein remain elusive.
In this study, we found that ISG20 expression is associated with many chemokines, leading to tumor infiltration of a variety of immune cells. CCL2/CCR2 is known for recruiting monocytes to the sites of inflammation produced by either tissue injury or infection, and augments the accumulation of regulatory Foxp3(+)CD4(+) T cells and of nitric oxide-and YM-1-expressing macrophages and microglia. 52 CCL5 induces chemotaxis in T cells and monocytes. 53-56 CCL23 might play vital roles in inflammation through the recruitment of macrophages and dendritic cells. 57 CCRL2/CXCR2 is the main neutrophil attractor in vitro, 58 and is involved in the control of both innate and adaptive immune responses. 59 CXCR6, a chemokine receptor for CXCL16 that is expressed on a subset of CD4 + T helper 1 cells and natural killer T cells, is involved in lymphocyte homing and modulates the development and progression of atherosclerosis. 60 Collectively, elevated expression of these chemokines may contribute to glioma progression by recruiting macrophages and neutrophils to the local tumor environment. Nevertheless, we did not find a significant association of microglia with ISG20 expression, suggesting that the ISG20-associated macrophages were monocyte-derived instead of residual microglial cells. 61 Moreover, we found that the majority of adaptive immune cells subtypes, such as Tgd, Tcm, Tfh, and Tem were less abundant, with increased expression of ISG20, which suggested that high ISG20 expression is associated with inefficient antitumor immunity. However, we did not find any correlation between ISG20 and natural killer cells, CD4 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells. We also detected a positive correlation of ISG20 levels with PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA4 expression, further inhibiting T cell function and leading to tumor evasion of immune responses. 62 The association of ISG20 expression with patient survival did not reach statistical significance for WHO grade II tumors and in the IDHmut tumors in TCGA cohort, although we found the same trend as the other groups. This may be due to the relatively longer survival of these patients. Further studies with more extended follow-up are needed to determine the prognostic value of ISG20 in these subgroups of patients.
In conclusion, our observations suggest that ISG20 strongly correlates with the tumor-induced immune response and infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils, which increases immunity in the tumor environment. Accordingly, ISG20 may serve as a useful prognostic marker for glioma and as a potential therapeutic target. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results and unveil the underlying mechanism.
The CGGA (http://www.cgga.org.cn) and TCGA (http://can cergenome.nih.gov) datasets were downloaded online. The transcriptome expression data of 932 gliomas were collected, ranging from WHO grade II to grade IV. In the CGGA dataset, there were 325 samples, including 144 GBM and 181 LGG samples. 63 In the TCGA dataset, 150 GBM and 457 LGG samples were available. Information on age, gender, diagnosis, WHO grade, chemo-and radiation therapy regimen, molecular data, and patient prognoses was also collected. Tumor tissues were also collected from 43 glioma patients who underwent surgery at the First Hospital of China Medical University between 2017 and 2018, including 19 WHO grade II patients, 12 grade III patients, and 12 GBM patients (Table S5 ). This study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Hospital of China Medical University, the institutional review boards of Capital Medical University, and the Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders Brain Tumor Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
The IDH mutation status of samples from the CGGA dataset was determined by aligning to the human reference genome (Hg19 Refseq) using IGV (version 2.3.93), which was previously shown to have good correlation with pyrosequencing results. 64, 65 The IDH status was available directly from the TCGA dataset. The 1p/19q co-deletion status was downloaded from the two datasets respectively. Detection of IDH1 and IDH2 status of 43 glioma patients in China Medical University was performed in the pathology department of the hospital by immunohistochemistry (antihuman IDH1R132H H09) and sequencing respectively.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Four μm-thick sections were cut and dewaxed in xylene, rinsed in graded ethanol, and rehydrated in distilled water. After antigen retrieval with sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0), endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H 2 O 2 . Then the sections were added with the appropriate antibody at appropriate dilution, then DAB staining solution was added. The sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and sealed. For immunofluorescence, antigen was retrieved with EDTA buffer (1 mM Tris/EDTA, pH 9.0) and endogenous fluorescence was eliminated with AutoFluo Quencher (Servicebio, Cat# G1221). The details of the antibodies used for immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry are given in Table S6 . Staining for each marker was scored using Image-pro plus (v.6.0). Integrated optical density (IOD) to area ratio was calculated for each marker to assess the staining intensity.
Immune-related genes were collected from the canonical biological pathways in the Molecular Signatures Database v. 4.0 (MSigDB, http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/msigdb/), 66,67 combined with genes identified in three publications from the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, [68] [69] [70] and genes selected among those involved in canonical immune processes indicated in Janeway's Immunobiology (9th edition). A total of 829 immune genes were confirmed by removing overlapping genes.
R language (v. 3.4.3), SPSS software (v. 22.0), and GraphPad Prism (v. 7.0) for Windows were used for statistical analyses and generating figures. GBM and LGG samples from the CGGA and TCGA datasets were analyzed respectively. Genes with significantly different expression between groups with distinct IDH status were estimated by a two-tailed Student's t-test. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) package of R was performed to control the FDR. Values of p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.01 were considered statistically significant. Genes that showed consistent differential expression in both the GBM and LGG cohorts from the two datasets were extracted. We then calculated the prognostic value of these differentially expressed genes using the survival package of R. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was performed for evaluating the independent prognostic variables. Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to depict survival distributions. Genes and immune cells correlated with ISG20 expression were explored by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) using R considering the effect of variant grades or IDH status. An absolute r-value of greater than 0.4 was considered to indicate a forcefully significant correlation with ISG20.
Gene annotation and pathway analyses were performed by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID v6.8 http://david.abcc.n-cifcrf.gov/), STRING (version 10.5 https://string-db.org/), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG http://www. kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to explore biological functions associated with ISG20. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA package of R http://www.bioconductor.org/) was implemented to validate the relationship of ISG20 and the candidate functions. To further define the immune cell subpopulations affected by ISG20 expression, we used the GSVA to explore the relationship between ISG20 and the predefined, highly distinctive transcriptional profile of each immune cell type. [71] [72] [73] [74] Twenty-four types of immune cells with corresponding gene signatures were analyzed (Table S7) . A threshold of an absolute correlation coefficient (r) greater than 0.3 with a p-value < 0.05 was used for selecting immune cells significantly correlated with ISG20.",ISG20 promotes local tumor immunity and contributes to poor survival in human glioma,"Gao, Mengqi; Lin, Yi; Liu, Xing; Li, Yiming; Zhang, Chuanbao; Wang, Zheng; Wang, Zhiliang; Wang, Yulin; Guo, Zongze",Oncoimmunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343791/,189,3011,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a data set containing 2.3 million lead-like molecules and a data set of all the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs are virtually screened for potential Mcl-1 ligands using Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 2MHS. The potential Mcl-1 ligands are evaluated and computationally docked on to three conformation ensembles generated by normal mode analysis (NMA), molecular dynamics (MD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), respectively. The evaluated potential Mcl-1 ligands are then compared with their clinical use. Remarkably, half of the top 30 potential drugs are used clinically to treat cancer, thus partially validating our virtual screen. The partial validation also favors the idea that the other half of the top 30 potential drugs could be used in the treatment of cancer. The normal mode-, MD-, and NMR-based conformation greatly expand the conformational sampling used herein for in silico identification of potential Mcl-1 inhibitors.","Apoptosis is a highly conserved and regulated process for eliminating damaged and surplus cells, such as those generated during normal embryonic development and abnormal cancer. 1 Important regulators of this process are the B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins, which include pro-and anti-apoptotic members. Antiapoptotic (ie, pro-survival) members include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), whereas pro-apoptotic members include Bax-like proteins, such as Bax, Bak, and Bok, and BH3-only proteins, such as Bad, Bim, Bmf, Bik, Hrk, Bid, Puma, and Noxa. 2 The interaction of pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins with regulators is a key element of cell survival and death.
Anti-apoptotic proteins are commonly overexpressed in a number of human cancers where they foster the survival of tumor cells. To inhibit anti-apoptosis (ie, promote apoptosis) and interfere with tumor cell survival, several small-molecule drugs that mimic pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins were developed. 3 The BH3-mimetics include ABT-737 4 and its orally available derivative ABT-263. 5 These BH3-mimetics bind selectively to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w and interfere with cell survival; however, they do not bind to Mcl-1 and some cancers cannot be treated by these compounds alone. To complicate things further, upregulation of Mcl-1 is a key factor in the development of resistance to ABT-737 and ABT-263. 2 Thus, there is an unmet need to design ligands, and in particular new small molecules, that inhibit Mcl-1. 6 Mcl-1 is a major cancer target, and Mcl-1 overexpression is often encountered in human cancer. 7, 8 Mcl-1 overexpression has been reported in breast cancer, 9 lung cancer, 10 prostate cancer, 11 pancreatic cancer, 12 cervical and ovarian cancers, 13 and leukemia. 14 Mcl-1 overexpression leads to resistance against Bcl-2-selective inhibitors and other smallmolecule drugs used in chemotherapy. 15 Remarkably, in vitro inhibition of Mcl-1 overexpression through RNA silencing inhibits tumor growth 16 and abolishes chemoresistance. 17 As such, Mcl-1 represents a promising cancer target.
Virtual screening is currently a classical tool in drug discovery applied in the search for novel compounds that target a given protein of interest. 18 Computational screening approaches have gained general acceptance because, in comparison with high-throughput screening techniques, they are able to decrease both time and cost by limiting the number of compounds that must be experimentally tested. 19 There are two main approaches for virtual screening: 1) ligand-based and 2) structure-based virtual screening. The latter approach is often used if the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a drug target is available from experimental studies. For Mcl-1, several experimental structures are available and are listed in Supplementary materials, Table S1 .
To assist virtual screening, several studies have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 20 MD simulation is a well-established method for understanding protein dynamics. In most cases, MD simulations provide snapshots that improve virtual screening predictive power over known crystal structures, possibly due to sampling more relevant conformations. Furthermore, unrestrained MD simulations can move conformations previously not amenable to docking into the predictive range. 21 To assist virtual screening, several studies have also used normal mode analysis (NMA). 22 NMA is one of the standard techniques for studying long-time dynamics and, in particular, low-frequency motions. 23 In contrast to MD, NMA provides an analytical and fully detailed description of the dynamics around a local energy minimum, 24, 25 and the conformation ensemble is generated by perturbing the initial structure along a set of relevant low-frequency normal modes.
To assist virtual screening, several studies have utilized structural ensembles obtained using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Using multiple fixed conformation either experimentally determined by crystallography or NMR is a practical shortcut that may improve docking calculations.
In several cases, this approach has led to experimentally validated predictions. 26, 27 Thus, NMR, MD, and NMA have each been used separately to improve virtual screening. Here, we combine the three to assist virtual screening for Mcl-1 inhibitors.
In this study, we use conformations sampled by three separate methods, namely, NMA, MD simulation, and NMR, and virtually screen for novel ligands that can modulate the activity of Mcl-1. Using this technique with two curated data sets, namely, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved drugs and lead-like molecules, we identify novel small molecules that could not have been detected using the unperturbed Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure.
For conformational sampling, we used model 1 of the NMR structure of PDB ID 2MHS 28 as a starting structure. Usually, NMR structures consist of an average structure and a number of ensemble structures. The NMR ensemble structures are numbered model 1, model 2, model 3, etc. As no average structure was available, we decided to use model 1 of PDB ID 2MHS as a starting structure.
To calculate normal modes of the Mcl-1 structure PDB ID 2MHS, 28 model 1, two programs were utilized, namely, STAND 23 and ElNémo. 29 For STAND, both real normal modes (REA) and Tirion modes (TIR) were calculated. For speed, the STAND option of coarse graining, 1 point, which accelerates the calculations yet does not flaw the results, was used, and default values of deformation amplitude were used. For ElNémo, default values of DQMIN -100 and DQMAX 100 were utilized. The DQMIN and DQMAX parameters correspond to the deformation amplitude in the direction of a single normal mode. For both STAND and ElNémo, only the three non-trivial lowest frequency modes were calculated. For each of these three modes, six PDB models were generated by STAND and six model structures were generated by ElNémo all fully distorted along the particular mode. These 12 model structures were subsequently used for molecular docking.
We run unrestrained MD of the Mcl-1 structure (PDB ID 2MHS, model 1), with the AMBER simulation package. 30 The simulation parameters were obtained from force fields leaprc.ff99SB for the protein and leaprc.gaff for organic molecules, since we used a water and ethanol solvent mixture. Our MD simulation comprises three stages, namely, system heating using constant number, constant volume, and constant 
Virtual screening for potential inhibitors of Mcl-1 conformations temperature (NVT), system equilibration using constant number, constant pressure, and constant temperature (NPT), and production using NVT. System heating uses NVT (ie, constant volume) since at low temperatures, pressure calculation may lead to barostat overcorrection and system instabilities. System equilibration uses NPT (ie, constant pressure) and allows system density to equilibrate before production. Production uses NVT (ie, constant volume). Our MD simulation is based on a protocol similar to the one described by Romero-Durana et al. 31 Shortly, each time step was set to 2 fs, heating time was 200 ps, equilibration time was 1 ns, and production time was 200 ns (see Supplementary materials, Figure S1 ).
To obtain hierarchal MD clusters, the biomolecular simulation trajectory and data analysis program cpptraj, 32 which is part of the AMBER package, were used. Clustering is a means of partitioning data so that data points inside a cluster are more similar to each other than they are to points outside a cluster. In the context of molecular simulation, this means grouping similar conformations together. Similarity is determined by a distance metric -the smaller the distance, the more similar the structures. One commonly used distance metric is coordinate root mean square deviation (RMSD). Application of this procedure resulted in four main clusters, from which one centroid conformation PDB structure was chosen for subsequent molecular docking.
The NMR conformational ensemble of PDB ID 2MHS 28 was used. This PDB entry contains 20 experimentally observed structures, which were all used for molecular docking.
To identify potential inhibitors of Mcl-1, two molecular data sets were virtually screened and docked on to Mcl-1 using the AutoDock Vina program. 33 The molecular data sets include a lead-like subset and an FDA-approved subset. The lead-like data set was based on the standard lead-like of the ZINC database (version 12, September 29, 2014), 34 which contains 6,053,287 molecules from which a subset of 2,300,000 molecules were randomly selected. The leadlike library has been pre-filtered based on the properties of molecular weight between 250 and 350 g/mol, predicted partition constant (× LogP) #3.5, and number of rotatable bonds #7. The FDA-approved subset contained 1,790 FDAand internationally approved drugs and was kindly provided by Dominique Douguet from the Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire. 35 To identify potential Mcl-1 inhibitors, we used multiple conformations of the protein. The multiple conformation comprised 20 NMR structures conformation of Mcl-1 (PDB ID 2MHS), 28 12 models obtained using NMA, and four models obtained using MD simulations. First, AutoDock calculation was performed on a representative structure of the NMR ensemble (model 1 of PDB ID 2MHS). Then, we picked the 1,000 ligands with the lowest binding energies and docked them on the multiple conformations sampled by NMR, NMA, and MD.
In all cases, AutoDock Vina (1.1.2 for linux) was run on our Ahalama cluster equipped with 960 Intel E5645 processors. In all cases, the default parameters of AutoDock Vina were as follows: the exhaustiveness of the global search was 8, the maximum number of binding modes to generate was 9, and the maximum energy difference between the best and worst binding mode displayed was 3 kcal/mol. For each ligand, only the best pose was retained. In all cases, the binding site on Mcl-1 was defined and limited by a box measuring 16, 18, and 20 Å. The X, Y, and Z coordinates of the center of the docking box were -2.2, -19.8, and 2.9, respectively. The box encompassed the entire binding groove of Mcl-1 and included the P1, P2, P3, and P4 binding sites defined by Belmar and Fesik. 2
Combined, the NMR structures, NMA distorted models, and MD simulation models span more of the conformational space of Mcl-1 than on their own. The MD models with an RMSD of 1.34 Å cover a larger area of the conformational space than the NMR and NMA models with RMSD values of 0.82 and 0.72 Å, respectively. The NMA and MD models each share less in common than with the NMR structure from which they were derived. In contrast to MD, NMA provides a detailed description of the dynamics around a local energy minimum. Combined, these conformations span a larger area of the conformational space of Mcl-1 than on their own.
Many PDB structures are available for Mcl-1 as listed in Supplementary materials, Table S1 . For molecular docking, we chose PDB ID 2MHS, as it was the only structure solved without a peptide or a ligand, and we believe it is closest to the native state of the protein and it does not suffer from induced fit distortions.
To test the validity of our in silico assay, we virtually docked several ligands known to bind to Mcl-1 and compared their predicted binding energy with their experimental binding constants. These ligands included the small molecules 36 The ligands were virtually docked to the multiple Mcl-1 conformations calculated herein using AutoDock Vina. 33 The ligands displayed predicted attractive (negative) binding energies in the following order: -4.97 Kcal/mol (3WIX), -4.86 Kcal/mol (4HW3), -4.82 Kcal/mol (4ZBI), -4.74 Kcal/mol (4ZBF), -2.95 Kcal/mol (5FDO), -0.5 Kcal/mol (5FDR), and repulsive (positive) binding energy +16.6 Kcal/mol (ABT-737). Remarkably, the ligands were ranked in accordance with their experimental binding constants, namely, ,1 nM (3WIX), ~10 nM (4HW3), ~10 nM (4ZBI), ~10 nM (4ZBF), ~100 nM (5FDO), ~100 nM (5FDR), and no binding (ABT-737). The small molecule, ABT-737, which does not bind to Mcl-1, provided a positive repulsive energy. Assuming that the positive binding energy was an error, the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the predicted and observed binding is 0.90. Thus, in a small data set, the predictive capacity of our in silico assay was confirmed, and we set out to test it in large data sets. Table 1 lists the top 10 lead-like molecules (see Supplementary materials, Figure S2 ) that bind to each Mcl-1 conformation sampled by NMR, NMA, and MD. The top 10 lead-like molecules are ranked according to their average binding energy. Interestingly, the three conformations (NMR, NMA, and MD) give diverse top 10 ranked compounds.
The top 10 ligands with the lowest average binding energies in the NMR conformation ensemble are ZINC069 09626, ZINC04529774, ZINC00134139, ZINC01668172, ZINC71890788, ZINC69705019, ZINC05500896, ZINC08405446, ZINC06507008, and ZINC95467634.
ZINC00134139 is structurally related to epinastine. ZINC1019606 is structurally related to S1, 37,38 a Bcl-2 family inhibitor that binds to Mcl-1 with nanomolar affinity. ZINC64613223 is structurally related to marinopyrrole A, a natural product isolated from an obligate marine Streptomyces that binds selectively to Mcl-1 (IC 50 =10.1 µM) and induces apoptosis in Mcl-1-dependent leukemia 39 and melanoma cells. 40 ZINC2673507 is structurally related to the indole-2-carboxylic acid 33 (PDB ID 4HW2) that was a potent inhibitor of Mcl-1 (Kd =55 nM).
Virtual screening using lead-like molecules provides little information except the general skeleton of a ligand. In this study, the lead-like molecule mostly has two aromatic rings linked to a hydrocarbon chain. The lead-like molecules often display nitrogen in the hydrocarbon chain and in the polycyclic aromatic rings. In contrast to FDA-approved drugs, the lead-like molecules have little or no bioavailability and pharmacodynamic activity. The lead-like molecules also risk suffering from toxicity and metabolic instability. Thus, the only information provided by the lead-like molecules is the general skeleton that seems to be common to most Mcl-1 inhibitors to date.
Virtual docking with FDa-approved drug data set 
Virtual screening for potential inhibitors of Mcl-1 conformations 2MHS) took ~300 hours, on the NMA distorted models took ~150 hours, and on the MD simulated models ~80 hours. Table 2 lists the top 10 FDA-approved drugs that bind to each Mcl-1 conformation ensemble sampled by NMR, NMA, and MD. The top 10 drugs are ranked according to their average binding energy. Remarkably, eight FDA-approved drugs are associated with cancer treatment and could become clinically relevant.
The top 10 ligands with the lowest average binding energies in the NMR conformation ensemble are exemestane, levorphanol, cyproheptadine, dextromethorphan, epinastine, lenvatinib, sibutramine, oxcarbazepine, mirtazapine, and darifenacin ( Figure 2) .
Interestingly, two of these, exemestane and lenvatinib, are clinically used and approved for the treatment of cancer. Exemestane is a third-generation aromatase inhibitor administered in breast cancer, 41 and lenvatinib is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 kinase inhibitor administered in thyroid cancer. 42 As such, exemestane and lenvatinib are favorable candidates for Mcl-1-targeted cancer therapies. Other drugs among the top 10 ligands include levorphanol, dextromethorphan, and sibutramine, which are morphine-like opioids with some noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Notably, dextromethorphan is sometimes used to dull pain in cancer, and several clinical trials are currently evaluating its effect in peripheral neuropathy management (ie, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02271893). Dextromethorphan could have an unexpected effect on the outcome of the chemotherapy treatment. Mirtazapine, cyproheptadine, oxcarbazepine, and epinastine are tricyclic compounds with histaminergic and serotonergic activity used to control pain and depression and as antiemetics in cancer. Notably, several clinical trials are currently evaluating them in palliative cancer management (ie, ClinicalTrials.gov IDs NCT01725048 and NCT02336750). If indeed Mcl-1 activity is experimentally shown, then these drugs could serve as adjuvants for cancer therapies. Finally, darifenacin is a muscarinic agonist used for urinary incontinence with little or no known relationship to cancer. Zinc69705019 (-6.65) Zinc78946317 (-8.11) Zinc48345734 (-6.73) 7

Remarkably, four of these have been associated with the treatment of cancer, namely, nilotinib, cabergoline, miltefosine, and adapalene. Nilotinib is a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Nilotinib, which shares some structural similarity with ABT-373, is currently undergoing clinical trials in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of relapsed solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02379416).
As such, nilotinib is a promising candidate for Mcl-1-targeted cancer therapies. Cabergoline is an ergot derivative and a potent D2 dopamine receptor agonist used in the treatment of prolactinomas and uterine fibroids. 43 Cabergoline contains a tricyclic ring that is structurally related to the pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitor, S1, 37,38 a Bcl-2 family inhibitor that binds to Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 with nanomolar affinity, disrupts Bax/Bcl-2 and Bak/Mcl-1 complexes, induces Bax/Bak-dependent apoptosis, 37 increases oxidative stress, 44 and disrupts the interaction of Beclin 1 with Bcl-2. 45 Cabergoline is currently undergoing clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer as an adjuvant therapy of tamoxifen (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01730729). Miltefosine is an alkylphosphocholine first studied as a treatment for cancer and approved for 
Virtual screening for potential inhibitors of Mcl-1 conformations leishmaniasis in India. Adapalene is a third-generation topical retinoid that inhibits keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. Of the top 10 drugs, four are atypical antipsychotics, namely, ergotamine, paliperidone, lurasidone, and risperidone, with serotonergic and dopaminergic activity. They are composed of a tricyclic head and an indole-like tail. Two other drugs do not seem to be associated with cancer and dopamine/serotonin pharmacology. These are deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, used to reduce chronic iron overload, and eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist used in the treatment of thrombocytopenia.
The top 10 ligands with the lowest average binding energies in the MD simulated conformation ensemble are azelastine, florbetapir, nebivolol, lenalidomide, dolasetron, droperidol, torsemide, mazindol, deferasirox, and thalidomide ( Figure 4) .
Remarkably, two of these are already associated with cancer therapy, namely, lenalidomide and thalidomide, which induce apoptosis and are used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. 46, 47 Thalidomide and lenalidomide are structural analogs of the rhodanine derivative, BH3I-1, developed by Degterev et al, 48 which binds the BH3 binding groove of Mcl-1 with micromolar affinity. Of the top 10 drugs, at least three have dopaminergic and serotonergic activity. Dolasetron is a serotonergic and dopaminergic antagonist used against nausea, droperidol is an antidopaminergic antipsychotic, mazindol is a catecholamine reuptake inhibitor and a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, trazodone is a serotonergic antagonist and reuptake inhibitor, and nebivolol is a β1-adrenergic receptor blocker with significant dopaminergic pharmacology. 49 (Structurally, trazodone is of particular interest as it ranks first on average.) Finally, three other drugs do not seem to be linked with serotonergic and dopaminergic activity. Azelastine is a second-generation H1 histamine receptor antagonist, deferasirox is an oral iron chelator used to reduce chronic iron overload, and torsemide is a pyridine-sulfonylurea-type loop diuretic mainly used in the management of edema associated 
In Supplementary materials, Table S2 , the binding energies of all ligands and their standard deviation are provided. The standard deviation characterizes the variation from the average ligand binding energy to 20 NMR, four MD, and six NMA conformations. AutoDock Vina was applied once for each Mcl-1 protein conformation, but by sampling multiple conformations, the signal-to-noise ratio of true positives is expected to increase. Ligands with low standard deviation of binding energies usually have few rotatable bonds, are rigid, and sometimes symmetric. For example, dihydroartemisinin and artemeter are rigidified by the polycyclic skeleton, whereas carbofenotion contains a C2 axis of pseudosymmetry. Contrarily, ligands with high standard deviations are highly flexible. The standard deviation is an indicator of entropy, and the more conformations a ligand may adopt, the more receptor poses are possible. Often, drug candidates with low standard deviation are preferred as binding is confined, but not always.
Remarkably, the rank order of the FDA-approved drug is comparable in all three conformation ensembles. FDAapproved drugs that rank high in the NMR ensemble also rank high in the MD and NMA conformations, and drugs that rank low in the NMR ensemble also have a low rank in the MD and NMA conformations. Figure 5 illustrates the agreement between the drug ranking in the conformations sampled by NMR, NMA, and MD.
Drug ranking of the 1,790 FDA-approved drugs in the NMR ensemble and in the MD conformations correlates well with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.87. Drug Notes: shown is a 3D scatter plot of the drug rank in the three conformation families. each axis enumerates the drug rank in the nMr, nMa, and MD conformations, respectively. each point represents one of the 1,790 FDa-approved drugs and is colored according to its rank. Top ranking drugs are colored red, and bottom ranking drugs are colored blue. Abbreviations: FDa, Food and Drug administration; nMr, nuclear magnetic resonance; nMa, normal mode analysis; MD, molecular dynamics; 3D, threedimensional.
ranking in the NMR ensemble and in the NMA conformations correlates less well with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.76. Surprisingly, drug ranking in the NMA conformation and in the MD conformations does not correlate well with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.54. The latter correlation makes sense in light of the diverging paths of the NMA and MD conformations from the original NMR structure.
This study provides a compendium of potential Mcl-1 inhibitors. The potential inhibitors were identified through virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs and lead-like molecules in multiple Mcl-1 conformations. The study is based on in silico observations and does not claim in vitro and in vivo activity. The study notes that many of the potential Mcl-1 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials in the treatment of cancer, supports their use, and proposes a complementary mode of action. The study does not recommend clinical trials with any of the other potential Mcl-1 inhibitors. The study brings to light potential Mcl-1 inhibitors and exposes them to the scientific community for further investigation.
This study postulates an additional target for some FDAapproved drugs, which may in fact also act on Mcl-1. Some of these drugs are already undergoing clinical trials as noted earlier. As such, this study paves the way for more informed clinical trials, in vivo and in vitro studies, experimental binding assays, and so on. Importantly, if a drug is already approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer, then the clinical use of the potential Mcl-1 inhibitors could be very promising.
In our experience, we cannot know how a docked ligand will modulate the target structure and whether it will act as an agonist or an antagonist. In the past, eg, we inadvertently designed Mcl-1-binding peptides that induced proliferation instead of apoptosis (unpublished results). Here too, it remains unknown if the potential Mcl-1 inhibitors proposed herein act as agonists or antagonists in the Mcl-1-binding site. The ligands could either stabilize or destabilize a conformation required for interactions and apoptosis, and only experimental data in vitro and in vivo and clinical trials can answer this question.
In AutoDock Vina, ligand binding energies (ΔG) are predicted in kcal/mol. Importantly, however, the binding energies should be viewed as qualitative -and not quantitative -binding indicators. The individual value of a ligand's binding energy is less informative than the binding energy relative to other ligands. This consideration should be kept in mind when analyzing ΔG values, and relative values (ΔΔG) are more useful.
Since Mcl-1 is located inside the cytosol, the potential drugs must be able to cross the cell membrane. For most FDA-approved drug candidates listed here, some form of membrane crossing has been reported. For the lead-like compounds, however, cellular penetration data are unavailable, and only estimates based on the predicted octanol/water partition coefficient (LogP) are available. 50 serotonergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic hypothesis Serotonin, dopamine, and histamine regulate cell proliferation, migration, maturation, and apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including lung, kidney, endothelial cells, mast cells, neurons, and astrocytes. 51, 52 Some of the potential Mcl-1 ligands presented here are serotonergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic modulators (ie, ergotamine, paliperidone, lurasidone, and risperidone) and share structural similarity with serotonin, dopamine, and histamine. We hypothesize that serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and Mcl-1 modulation are associated. Such a coincidence is further supported by the vicious cycle of depression, anxiety, and cancer, which are both characterized by abnormally low levels of serotonin and dopamine. 53 Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2017:11 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 1812 glantz-gashai et al","Virtual screening for potential inhibitors of Mcl-1 conformations sampled by normal modes, molecular dynamics, and nuclear magnetic resonance","Glantz-Gashai, Yitav; Meirson, Tomer; Reuveni, Eli; Samson, Abraham O",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5484510/,166,3963,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,54e82ae1126dc9eed820d7a255cb4edca68a9f82,"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) causes acute and severe watery diarrhoea and dehydration, as well as 50-100 per cent mortality in piglets. For the PEDV diagnosis, a rapid test kit that is specific and sensitive to PEDV is critical to monitor this disease at pig farms. The present study aimed to develop an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) strip test for detecting PEDV in faecal swabs. The newly developed diagnostic test showed a detection limit of 10 4.0 TCID 50 /ml of PEDV. Using faecal swab samples, the relative sensitivity and specificity of the ICA kit were 95.0 per cent and 98.6 per cent, respectively, compared with those of real-time RT-PCR. In samples from piglets experimentally infected with PEDV, the results showed 100 per cent agreement with those found by real-time RT-PCR. Our developed test strip will be useful for rapid diagnosis and can be used for epidemiological surveillance of PEDV infection.","Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes acute and severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration, and shows 50-100 per cent mortality in up to one-week-old piglets and less severe disease in older pigs. 1 PEDV belongs to genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and is an enveloped single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. 2 3 Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) have been reported in several countries in Europe, as well as in Asian countries including China, Thailand and South Korea, since the disease was first identified in England in the early 1970s. 1 3 Recently, PEDV was diagnosed in the midwestern region of the USA in 2013. 4 5 Since then, the virus has spread rapidly and was confirmed throughout 30 states in the USA. PEDV has significant economic impacts on the pig industry, causing the loss of approximately seven million piglets within the one-year epidemic period in the USA. 3 Moreover, the emergence of PEDV has been reported in western, central and eastern Europe, and the genome sequences were found to be closely related to PEDV strains from the USA, showing a sequence identity of more than 99 per cent. [6] [7] [8] The genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kb in size and encodes four structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N), and four non-structural proteins, including 1a, 1b, 3a and 3b. 2 The S protein is critical to regulating interactions between receptor glycoproteins and virus ligands and for mediating viral entry into host cells, while the N protein is a basic phosphor-protein important for maintaining the nucleocapsid structure. Epitopes of the N protein may play a role in inducing cell-mediated immunity. 2 Additionally, the N protein may be an appropriate target because it is the predominant antigen expressed in coronavirus-infected cells. 9 To diagnose PEDV, laboratory-based techniques are necessary, because PED is clinically indistinguishable from other diarrhoea diseases such as transmissible gastritis-enteritis virus infection. 10 To detect the PEDV antigen, virus isolation, immunofluorescence testing, immunohistochemical techniques, ELISA, and molecular techniques including RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR are currently used in most laboratories. 1 However, to obtain accurate results, these methods require welltrained technicians and specific equipment, and are time-consuming. Moreover, issues such as transportation delays or temperature changes during shipping from outbreak locations to diagnostic laboratories may affect the diagnosis results. 1 10 Therefore, a rapid test kit that is specific and sensitive to PEDV is critical to monitoring this disease on pig farms. Here, we aimed to develop and validate an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for the rapid and qualitative detection of PEDV antigen from diseased animals. The assay detects N protein of PEDV using highly selective monoclonal antibodies.
To express the PEDV-N protein, cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from the PEDV-DR13 strain (accession no. JQ023161) provided by Green Cross Veterinary Product (Suwon, Korea). The N protein gene was amplified using primers 5-GGA TCC ATG GCT TCT GTC AGC TTT-3 and 5-GTC GAC TTA ATT TCC TGT GTC AAA-3. The PCR products were cloned into the BamH I/Sal I restriction site (underlined) of the pFastBac vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and this recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli DH10Bac containing a baculovirus shuttle vector (Bacmid, Invitrogen). The recombinant Bacmid DNA carrying the PEDV-N protein gene was transfected using Cellfectin Reagent (Invitrogen) into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells. Expression of the N protein gene of PEDV was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, Sf-9 cells expressing N protein of PEDV were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) lysis buffer (1 per cent Triton X-100, 1 per cent deoxycholate and 0.1 per cent SDS). The proteins were then separated on 10 per cent SDS polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5 per cent skimmed milk buffer and incubated with polyclonal anti-PEDV from mice immunised with PEDV at 4°C overnight. For protein detection, the membrane was incubated with antimouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody and visualised using the ATTO Ez-Capture II system (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant baculoviruses expressing PEDV-N protein were propagated in Sf-9 cells. The recombinant N protein was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
To produce monoclonal antibodies, BALB/c mice (six to eight weeks old) were intraperitoneally immunised with the purified N protein antigen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Three identical boosters were administrated with the N protein emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant one-week intervals. The immunised mice were sacrificed to isolate spleen cells, which were washed in serum-free cell culture medium. Splenocytes (1×10 8 ) were mixed with myeloma cells line Sp2/0-Ag-14 (ATCC CRL 1581) (2×10 7 ) in a ratio of 5:1 in the presence of polyethylene glycol for cell fusion. The fused cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) selection medium. Culture medium was exchanged with fresh HAT selection medium eight days after fusion. On day 11, the supernatants were screened by ELISA, and then mAb anti-PED 3B12-1A6 and mAb anti-PED 1H12-1C6 hybridomas, which strongly reacted with the PEDV protein, were selected. Each hybridoma cell was intraperitoneally injected into naïve BALB/C mice to generate ascetic fluid. The ascetic fluid was then purified on protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The antibody concentrations were measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
The binding affinity of the mAbs was calculated following surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using ProteOn XPR36 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Purified mAb 3B12-1A6 or mAb 1H12-1C6 was immobilised to a GLC chip (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using a standard Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (ED-C)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) cross-linking reaction, and affinity values (ka, kd, KD) of each mAb for PEDV were determined by ProteOn Manager RM 2.1 software. Calculation of the binding affinity was performed in Gyeonggi Bio-Center (Suwon, Republic of Korea). To further characterise the mAbs for epitope recognition, we used a competition ELISA to test whether the mAbs recognise different epitopes of PEDV as in a previously described method. 11 Briefly, the recombinant N protein was coated onto a microtitre plate, and the plate was blocked with casein buffer. Biotinylated mAb and/or non-biotinylated mAb were added to the wells, and the plate was reacted with HRP-conjugated avidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The colour reaction was stopped and read as optical density at 450 nm using an automated plate reader.
Characterisation of the monoclonal antibody was conducted by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). For IFA, Vero cells inoculated with PEDV, ST cells inoculated with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), and MA-104 cells inoculated with porcine rotavirus were grown in cell culture chamber slides. The slides fixed with cold acetone were incubated with the PEDV mAbs at 37°C for 45 minutes. After washing, the slides were reacted with goat antimouse IgG conjugated with FITC at 37°C for 45 minutes and examined under a fluorescence microscope.
Establishment and assembly of the ICA kit For establishment of ICA kit, the monoclonal antibody, anti-PED 3B12-1A6, purified from ascetic fluid using protein G resin (GE Healthcare) was coated onto a specific area (test line) of a nitrocellulose membrane, while goat antimouse IgG was coated onto another specific area (control line) on the same membrane. To produce the test conjugate, a different monoclonal antibody, anti-PED 1H12-1C6, was mixed with colloidal gold prepared by trisodium citrate reduction method as previously described, 12 and then the antibody mixture was treated by a previously described method. 12 The assay strips were prepared by assembly with the colloidal gold-conjugated glass fibre, the nitrocellulose membrane and an absorbent paper using polyvinyl chloride self-adhesive floor.
The specificity of the ICA kit for other PEDV strains was tested with PEDV-KNU1309 (accession no. KJ451044), PEDV-KNU1303 (accession no. KJ451038) and PEDV-KNU1402 (accession no. KJ451048), which have 99 per cent identity with the viruses identified in the US pig populations. Additionally, the specificity of the ICA kit against PEDV was evaluated for other porcine viruses including TGEV, PRCV and porcine rotavirus obtained from Green Cross Veterinary Product. For the ICA kit test, the culture supernatant (100 µl) of each virus or cell culture medium as a negative control was transferred into a test tube containing 100 µl of assay diluent (50 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 10 mM NaCl, 0.1 per cent Tween 20, 1 parts per million ProClin 300). The mixture (100 µl) was applied to the sample well of the test kit and the test signal for each test was visualised after 15 minutes.
The sensitivity of ICA was evaluated by comparing the detection limit using real-time RT-PCR as previously described with some modifications. 13 Briefly, real-time RT-PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 µl containing viral RNA, PEDV forward (5'-CGC AAAG ACTG AACC CACTAATTT-3') and reverse (5'-TTG CCTC TGTT GTTA CTTGGAGAT-3') primers, probe (6-carboxyfluorescein
[FAM]-5'-TGT TGCC ATTG CCAC GACTCCTGC-3'-BHQ1), 4x TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and water. The reaction was performed on a LightCycler 480 System (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) beginning with reverse transcription at 58°C for 30 minutes, followed by heat denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds, and annealing and extension at 60°C for 1 minute. The data were analysed using LC480 software (Roche Diagnostics). Serial tenfold dilutions of the PEDV-DR13 strain including TEGV, PRCV and porcine rotavirus corresponding 1×10 6.0 to 1×10 1.0 TCID 50 /ml were analysed with the ICA kit and real-time RT-PCR.
Evaluation of ICA kit using clinical samples A total of 130 rectal swab samples consisting of faeces were collected from pig farms in eight provinces in South Korea between January 2012 and May 2014. These herds were suspected to have enteric viral infection showing typical clinical signs such as diarrhoea, vomiting, high mortality and no response to antibiotic treatment. All samples were tested to detect PEDV infection by real-time RT-PCR and evaluated using the ICA kit to determine the relative specificity and sensitivity. For the experimental infection study, a total of eight piglets (three-day-old, seronegative for PEDV) were obtained from sows with no disease history.
These piglets were orally inoculated with 3 ml of PEDV-DR13 strain (10 2.0 LD 50 /ml) in minimum essential medium cell culture medium, and clinical signs in all piglets were monitored for 10 consecutive days postinoculation (dpi). The rectal cavity of piglets was gently rubbed with a sterile moistened cotton swab, which were taken daily for monitoring. To evaluate the applicability of the ICA kit for diagnosing PEDV infection in pigs, 100 µl rectal swab transport medium was transferred into a test tube containing 100 µl of the assay diluents, and then a total of 100 µl of the supernatant was added to the test well of the ICA kit using a disposable dropper. All animal experiments complied with the current laws in the Republic of Korea.
Expression of the PEDV N protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig 1a) . The binding affinity calculated by SPR analysis of mAb 3B12-1A6 and mAb 1H12-1C6 were KD: 4.91E-09 M (ka: 1.97E+05 1/Ms; kd: 9.67E-04 1/s) and KD: 5.09E-09 M (ka: 6.00E+04 1/ Ms; kd: 3.05E-04 1/s), respectively. The kinetics of the mAbs to bind PEDV were similar in the examination. A competition ELISA was performed to test whether the mAbs recognise different epitopes of PEDV. As shown Table 1 , recognition level of mAb 3B12-1A6 to its epitope was not blocked either alone or in combination with different mAb, and binding of mAb 1H12-1C6 to its epitope was also not blocked. These results indicate that both mAbs recognise different epitopes on PEDV.
Cells infected with PEDV and stained with mAb 3B12-1A6 or mAb 1H12-1C6 showed typical cytoplasmic fluorescence of PEDV on the IFA, while the other cells infected with TGEV, PRCV and porcine rotavirus did not show fluorescence for both PEDV mAbs (Fig  1b) . The best result for detecting the PEDV detection threshold was obtained using the optimised concentration of the monoclonal antibodies in the ICA kit. We applied 0.60±0.12 µg mAb anti-PED 3B12-1A6 to a nitrocellulose membrane. The maximum intensity of test line colouring was detected when the mAb anti-PED 1H12-1C6 conjugated with 0.1±0.02 µg colloidal gold of coated on a glass fibre membrane for immobilisation. Further increasing the mAb concentration did not increase test line intensity. Positive results for PEDV-DR13, PEDV-KNU1309, PEDV-KNU1303 and PEDV-KNU1402 strains were demonstrated by the visualisation of two red-purple bands at the test line and control line on the ICA kit. However, TGEV, PRCV and porcine rotavirus were considered negative when only one band appeared in the control line, such as the cell culture medium. In the determination of the sensitivity of the ICA kit, real-time RT-PCR showed a sensitivity of up to 10 2.0 TCID 50 /ml of PEDV, while the detection limit of the ICA kit was 10 4.0 TCID 50 /ml (Table 2) .
Of the 130 swab samples tested, 58 were positive for PEDV and 72 were negative according to the ICA kit, whereas 60 were positive and 70 were negative according to real-time RT-PCR (Table 3) . Thus, three samples were positive (threshold cycle value of 29.5, 30.2 and 31.7) by real-time RT-PCR, but not detected in the ICA kit test. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the ICA kit compared with those of real-time RT-PCR were 95.0 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval: 86.08-98.96) and 98.6 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval: 92.30-99.96), respectively.
Piglets inoculated with the PEDV strain experienced moderate to severe diarrhoea starting on 1 dpi. Most infected piglets showing clinical signs died between 2 and 9 dpi except for one piglet, which recovered from clinical signs at 9 dpi and survived during the experimental challenge (Table 4 ). In a comparison of the diagnosis methods, examination with the ICA kit using swab samples showed consistent results with real-time RT-PCR in identifying PEDV.
Since the PEDV emergency in the USA in 2013, PED outbreaks have occurred worldwide. The prototype of PEDV is the CV777 strain, which was identified in 1977 in Belgium. Next, PEDV spread throughout Europe and Asia during the 1980s and 1990s and recently emerged in the USA. Based on extensive phylogenetic analysis using obtained sequences, PEDV strains are classified into two major categories: the classical PEDV strain showing lower pathogenicity and highly virulent PEDV strain that emerged in 2010. However, most studies aimed at developing techniques for diagnosing PEDV infection have attempted to differentiate various diarrhoea-causing antigens rather than differentiating between classical and novel PEDV strains. In the present study, we established an ICA kit that can be universally applied for PEDV infection screening without differentiation. The first advantage of this diagnostic kit is that it can be used for any diarrhoea case in which viral infection is suspected, but for which there is no available information regarding PEDV strain involvement. Second, ICA is useful upon emergence of novel PEDV strains, for which a strain-specific diagnostic method may be ineffective. Thus, another optimised diagnostic method should be considered to differentiate classical and novel PEDV strains if additional detection becomes essential for epidemiological studies or disease control. The detection limit of the ICA kit was10 4.0 TCID 50 / ml, while its sensitivity was less than that of real-time RT-PCR (10 2.0 TCID 50 /ml). It is generally accepted that rapid screening test kits may not be as sensitive as gold standard methods for virus diagnosis such as real-time PCR. However, high relative specificity and sensitivity results for PEDV were observed using field samples. Considering the performance of the ICA kit, we additionally assessed the sensitivity of the test in samples from piglets experimentally infected with PEDV; the results showed 100 per cent agreement with real-time RT-PCR results. These results of the challenge study clearly indicate the value of well-defined serial stool samples from experimentally infected animals, as the results of these samples are not influenced by previous infections with PEDV or other gastroenteric pathogens.
Furthermore, the ICA kit targets the nucleocapsid protein of PEDV, which is a conserved region that may be applicable for assessing not only prototype strains, but also novel strains of PEDV from different geographical regions. 14 15 Therefore, the presence of new PEDV variant strains should be monitored, and the test kit may be useful for rapid diagnosis of PEDV in the USA and other countries.
The ICA kit has the advantages of being easy, user-friendly and deliverable without specific equipment available in field conditions. Examination of clinical samples showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay approached 95.0 per cent and 98.6 per cent, respectively, compared with those of the real-time RT-PCR, and 100 per cent agreement of the results were observed in faecal samples from experimentally infected piglets. Thus, the ICA kit developed in this study can be used for rapid diagnosis and can assist in epidemiolog- ical surveillance of PEDV infection. The development of a rapid and easily confirmed diagnosis for PEDV antigen detection is important for controlling PED outbreaks and limiting their spread; however, the ICA kit cannot differentiate novel variant strains. Therefore, an ICA kit that can differentiate PEDV variant strains using a multiplex strip should be developed in future studies.",Development of rapid immunochromatographic strip test for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus,"Lyoo, Kwang-Soo; Yeom, Minjoo; Kim, Jungho; Kim, Donghyuk; Ha, Gunwoo; Na, Woonsung; Le, Van Phan; Song, Daesub",Vet Rec,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5738603/,150,2866,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,64212980bf5953f369ec10e8a54517ec6ce10227,"To investigate the impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on α2-Heremans-Schmid Glycoprotein (AHSG/fetuin A) and potential associations with disease and patient characteristics.
AHSG serum levels were determined in treatment-naïve newly-diagnosed patients, 96 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 84 with Crohn's disease (CD), 62 with diarrheapredominant or mixed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, D-and M-types) and 180 healthy controls (HC), by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
All patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 years at the Gastroenterology Department of the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. C-reactive protein (CRP), anti-glycan antibodies, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies IgG, anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgG, anti-laminariobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgG and anti-chitobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgA were also determined via immunonephelometry and ELISA, respectively.
The mean ± SE of serum AHSG, following adjustment for confounders, was 0.32 ± 0.02 g/L in IBD, 0.32 ± 0.03 g/L in CD and 0.34 ± 0.03 g/L in UC patients, significantly lower than in IBS patients (0.7 ± 0.018 g/L) and HC (0.71 ± 0.02 g/L) (P < 0.0001, in all cases). AHSG levels were comparable between the CD and UC groups. Based on AHSG levels IBD patients could be distinguished from HC with about 90% sensitivity and specificity. Further adjusted analysis verified the inverse association between AHSG and penetrating, as well as stricturing CD (partial correlation coefficient: -0.45 and -0.33, respectively) (P < 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, inverse correlations between AHSG and CRP and the need for anti-TNFα therapy or surgery, were found (partial correlation coefficients: -0.31, -0.33, -0.41, respectively, P < 0.05, in all cases).
Finally, IBD individuals who were seropositive, for at least one marker, had AHSG levels falling within the two lower quartiles (OR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.5-5.44, P < 0.001) while those with at least two serological markers positive exhibited AHSG concentrations within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.03, 95%CI: 2.07-12.21, P < 0.001), after adjusting for age, sex and smoking.
AHSG can be used to distinguish between IBD and IBS patients or HC while at the same time ""predicting"" complicated disease behavior, need for therapy escalation and surgery. Moreover, AHSG may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of IBD, since it is involved in key processes.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been long ago recognized as a systemic inflammatory entity and as such, it is anticipated to induce changes exceeding the boundaries of bowel mucosa, being reflected in a broader spectrum of tissues, including blood [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .
Examples of such changes are the fluctuations in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukins, S100 proteins, metalloproteinases, angiogenins, etc [4] [5] [6] [7] . Since a different task is carried out by each of these biomarkers, it has been proposed that IBD induces multifarious responses which in turn, may affect the levels of different compounds via feedback mechanisms, consumption or reprioritisation of synthesis [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . These observations along with the inflammatory nature of IBD itself seem to encourage the study of novel proteins that tend to become affected by the establishment of systemic inflammation [3, 8] . Such a candidate is fetuin A or α2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), a substance synthesized in the liver, bone marrow and fetal organs, exhibiting properties similar to those possessed by negative acute-phase proteins [9] . AHSG has been shown to carry out various immunologic tasks, including regulation of macrophage-related lipopolysaccharide-triggered opsonisation, TNF-α and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) levels [10] [11] [12] [13] . AHSG is also an inhibitor of ectopic tissue calcification such as that taking place in coronary arteries and heart valves, while at the same time promoting mineralization within fibrils and subsequently, proper bone formation [13] [14] [15] . Other recently discovered properties of AHSG include a binding ability to insulin receptor, modifying its sensitivity, participation in wound healing as well as tumor growth processes, through the induction of a more effective cell migration [8, 9] . Increased AHSG levels have been recorded in fetal organs (probably reflecting an additional role for AHSG in normal organ development), in adults with either metabolic syndrome or increased insulin resistance alone, patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus as well as individuals at high risk for future cardiovascular events: stroke and acute myocardial infarction [8, 9, 16] . Low levels of AHSG have been recorded in patients on hemodialysis, those with cirrhosis, hepatoma or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an entity sharing common inflammatory pathways with IBD, and have been linked to vascular -excessive valvular and coronary artery calcification, ischemic events-and skeletal disorders -osteopenia [14, 17, 18] . Moreover, similar phenomena: upregulation of TNF-α and TGF-β, remodelling in intestinal microvessels, both on an acute and chronic basis, as well as manifestations linked to mineral homeostasis i.e., osteoporosis and urolithiasis, are all exerted in IBD. When bearing in mind these characteristics, the idea of examining AHSG levels in IBD, seems more than tempting [4, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .
Among several patients visiting ER wards, outpatient clinics or being hospitalised for chronic diarrhea, a total of 242 patients were recruited: 96 diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC), 84 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 62 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). All patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 years at the Department of Gastroenterology at the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. Another group consisting of 180 healthy individuals was also formed (HC). Study groups were age and sex matched (P > 0.05) with one exception: the CD and UC groups, differed significantly (P = 0.002) as anticipated, since CD is often associated with younger age. All individuals participating in the study lacked any known disease i.e., end-stage renal disease, RA, cirrhosis, hepatoma, liver metastases potentially affecting AHSG levels, with the exception of diabetes mellitus (DM), which was treated as a confounding factor and was embedded in the models used for multivariate testing. The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and HC are presented in Table 1 .
The diagnosis of IBD and IBS was established upon the co-evaluation of findings originating from clinical and endoscopic procedures, imaging studies, histopathology and laboratory analyses. IBS patients were also diagnosed and classified as D-IBS or M-IBS (40 and 22 individuals, respectively) according to the Rome Ⅲ criteria [24] . Disease activity in the IBD group was documented using conventional indices: Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Clinical Activity Index (CAI), for UC [25, 26] . A CDAI score greater than 439 January 21, 2017|Volume 23|Issue 3| WJG|www.wjgnet.com 150 and a CAI score exceeding 4, on a 0-16 scale, were considered as active CD and active UC, respectively. Disease location and behavior, in CD, were determined using the Vienna classification whereas for disease extent, in UC, the Montreal classification was used [27, 28] . No animals were used for the present study.
Blood samples were collected upon presentation of patients in our hospital, in serum separator tubes and were allowed to clot for 30 min. All samples were then centrifuged and the obtained serum was stored at -25 ℃ for later analysis. The pre-analytical phase, including sampling and handling methods (sampling tubes, storage conditions etc.) was identical in all cases.
AHSG assay: For AHSG determinations, a two-site ""sandwich"" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed, using a commercially available human Fetuin A ELISA kit (BioSource Europe SA, Belgium). Assay calibrators, controls and prediluted patient serum samples (10 μL initially) containing human AHSG were added to microplate wells, coated with a high affinity polyclonal goat anti-human AHSG antibody. During incubation period, the antibody could capture human AHSG in the sample. Unbound proteins were then washed away and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated polyclonal anti-human AHSG antibody was added to each well, so that a ""sandwich"" of ""capture antibody-human AHSG-HRP conjugated detecting antibody"" could be formed. After additional washing, incubation with a substrate solution took place, the reaction was stopped and the developed colour was quantified spectrophotometrically. The enzymatic activity of the detecting antibodies, bound to the AHSG on the wall of the microwells, was directly proportional to the amount of AHSG in the sample. A calibration curve which was generated by plotting the absorbance vs the respective human AHSG concentration for each calibrator, allowed sample AHSG determination.
C-reactive protein assay: For the determination of C-reactive protein (CRP), immunonephelometry was performed using the Behring Nephelometer Analyzer Ⅱ, as well as the N High Sensitivity commercially available kit (Dade Behring Gmbh, Germany). The control and standard sera were provided by the same company and used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Anti-glycan antibodies assay: Serum levels of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (gASCA) IgG, anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibodies (AMCA) IgG, anti-laminariobioside carbohydrate antibodies (ALCA) IgG and anti-chitobioside carbohydrate antibodies (ACCA) IgA were also determined in 108 IBD (56 CD and 52 UC) patients, using commercially available ELISA kits (IBDX, Glycominds Ltd., Israel). Cut-off levels for positivity were set at 50, 100, 60, and 90 U/mL for gASCA IgG, AMCA IgG, ALCA IgG, and ACCA IgA, respectively, as instructed by the manufacturer.
Normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test was initially carried out and since the normality assumption was satisfied for the comparison of means between two groups, Student's t-tests were used. For comparisons between multiple groups, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests were applied. Variables are expressed as mean ± SD or mean ± SE. For variables without comparable variations, Welch's correction has been applied. AHSG was tested for its ability to predict IBD, UC and CD, separately, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, while area under the curve (AUC) and cut-off values, with the optimal sensitivity and specificity, were also calculated. For the simple correlation studies, Pearson's rank test was used. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Whenever statistical significance or trend (0.05 < P < 0.1) was recorded in univariate analysis, multivariate testing was also performed. Using multiple linear regression and a backward selection process independent variables affecting AHSG levels -confounders -were identified. As candidate confounding factors were initially considered age, sex, smoking, DM, treatment modalities, disease duration and behaviour, age at onset. For the associations originating from multiple linear regression, partial correlation coefficients -quantifying the relationship between two variables while controlling for other factors-are reported. Whenever a categorical parameter was treated as dependent variable, logistic regression analyses, simple and multiple, were applied and odds ratios (ORs) as well as 95%CIs, unadjusted/adjusted for confounding, were calculated. Adjusted means were also calculated using analysis of covariance. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (4.0 and 7.0) and the MedCalc 10.2.0.0 statistical softwares. Statistical review of the study was performed by a biostatistician.
The study was approved by the University of Thessaly Medical School Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants, along with a verbal permission for the use of the acquired samples for scientific research.
The mean ± SE of AHSG in serum was 0.33 ± 0.01 g/L for IBD, 0.73 ± 0.02 g/L for IBS patients and 0.7 ± 0.02 g/L for HC. The recorded difference between the IBD and control groups was statistically significant (P < 0.0001) and this was also the case when CD and UC were compared separately with IBS patients and HC. AHSG levels in the CD group were 0.31 ± 0.01 g/L, significantly lower than those of IBS patients and HC (P < 0.0001). Likewise, UC patients also exhibited lower AHSG levels (0.34 ± 0.01 g/L) compared to IBS patients and HC (P < 0.001). These differences remained significant between IBD (0.32 ± 0.02 g/L), CD (0.32 ± 0.03 g/L) or UC patients (0.34 ± 0.03 g/L), IBS patients (0.7 ± 0.018 g/L) and HC (0.71 ± 0.02 g/L), after adjustment for age and sex (P < 0.001, for all comparisons). When AHSG levels were compared between UC and CD patients or between IBS patients and HC, no significant differences were observed (P > 0.05, in both cases) ( Figure 1 ). ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off of AHSG for the prediction of IBD was 0.44 g/L (90% sensitivity and specificity). Similarly, an AHSG value of 0.44 g/L could distinguish CD patients from non-IBD individuals (IBS and HC) with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 90.6%, while a value of 0.42 g/L could discriminate UC patients and non-IBD subjects with 91.7% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity. The AUC was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.91-0.97), 0.94 (95%CI: 0.91-0.97) and 0.95 (95%CI: 0.92-0.98) for the prediction of IBD, UC and CD, respectively (P < 0.0001, in all cases) ( Figure 2 ).
All IBD patients exhibited active disease when blood was drawn for later analysis. In our study, in patients with active disease the AHSG levels were marginally associated with CDAI and CAI scores (r = -0.24, P = 0.08). When disease location (CD) and extent (UC) were taken under consideration no statistically significant differences were observed (P > 0.05 in all cases).
Another part of the present study included the comparison of AHSG serum concentrations among CD patients with diverse disease behavior: stricturing, penetrating and non-stricturing non-penetrating (ns/np). The performed analysis showed that patients with stricturing or penetrating disease had lower AHSG levels (0.26 ± 0.07 g/L and 0.26 ± 0.06 g/L, respectively), compared to patients in the ns/np subgroup (0.33 ± 0.07 g/L). These differences were statistically significant between CD patients with stricturing and ns/np (P < 0.01) or between the penetrating and ns/np disease subgroup (P < 0.001) but not between the stricturing and penetrating subgroups (P > 0.05) (Figure 3 ). Further analysis verified the inverse association between AHSG and penetrating, as well as stricturing CD, both before (r = -0.44 and -0.32, respectively, P < 0.05), as well as after adjustment (partial correlation coefficient: -0.45 and -0.33, respectively, P < 0.05) for age, sex and smoking status. In order to perform additional testing of the link between lower AHSG levels and complicated disease behavior, logistic regression was applied, while considering penetrating or stricturing CD, as dependent, and AHSG concentrations, in quartiles -lowest, low, high, highest -as independent variables. The results originating from this analysis showed that AHSG levels, in the lowest quartile, were associated with both penetrating as well as stricturing disease, before (OR = 4.25, 95%CI: 1.54-11.8 and OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.1-8.31, respectively) and after adjustment (OR = 8.36, 95%CI: 2.57-27.17 and OR = 3.5, 95%CI: 1.47-12.9, respectively) for age, sex and smoking status (P < 0.01, in all cases).
AHSG levels were also examined with respect to the presence of one or more IBD-related extraintestinal manifestations. IBD patients exhibiting extraintestinal manifestations had comparable AHSG levels (0.32 ± 0.01 g/L) to the IBD subgroup without such disorders (0.33 ± 0.01 g/L, P = 0.55). Interestingly, 11 IBD patients with a history of recurrent urolithiasis had AHSG levels at the lowest quartile, this result, however, did not reach statistical significance. All data on AHSG variations according to the already described disease characteristics are presented in Table 2 .
The levels of serum AHSG were studied with respect to gender of IBD patients, so that potential differences could be highlighted. Both male and female IBD patients exhibited comparable AHSG levels (0.32 ± 0.01 g/L and 0.33 ± 0.01 g/L, respectively) (P = 0.53). Likewise, AHSG levels were similar between IBD patients, while taking into account age at onset and smoking habits (Table 3) .
Serum AHSG concentrations were examined with regard to treatment modalities adequate for inducing and maintaining remission during the 3-year follow up period: 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-TNFα agents or surgery. During comparison, IBD patients requiring surgical intervention or the use of anti-TNFα therapy exhibited lower AHSG concentrations (0.26 ± 0.07 g/L and 0.3 ± 0.05 g/L), compared to those adequately treated with 5-ASA (0.33 ± 0.05 g/L) or corticosteroids (0.35 ± 0.1 g/L) (P < 0.05, in both cases). Further evaluation of the recorded associations, using simple linear regression analysis, showed that AHSG levels were inversely associated with the need for anti-TNFα treatment (r = -0.31, P < 0.05) and surgery (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). After multivariate analysis -also considering age, sex, activity, duration, smoking status-the inverse association between AHSG and need for anti-TNFα therapy or surgery remained statistically significant (partial correlation coefficients: -0.33 and -0.41, respectively -P < 0.05, in both cases). Since these results are suggestive of a link between a more profound downregulation of AHSG levels and the need for anti-TNFα treatment or surgical intervention, AHSG concentrations were classified into quartiles. Using logistic regression, AHSG levels in the lowest quartile were found to be an independent predictor of the need for anti-TNFα treatment, in a model adjusted for other treatment modalities, age, sex, smoking status and disease duration (OR = 5.22, 95%CI: 1.58-17.3, P < 0.01). Similarly, by applying the same adjusted model, it was shown that need for surgery could be independently predicted by the presence of AHSG levels within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.51, 95%CI: 1.11-27.3, P < 0.01).
IBD patients had higher CRP levels (median: 3.2 mg/dL, range: 0.9-29.3 mg/dL) compared to IBS (median: 1.05 mg/dL, range: 0-4.3 mg/dL) and HC groups (median: 0.9 mg/dL, range: 0-2.8 mg/dL) (P < 0.001). A correlation study of AHSG with the levels of the inflammatory marker CRP was performed revealing marginal association (r = -0.28, P = 0.07). Multivariate analysis, considering as confounding variables age, sex and smoking on the other hand, revealed a closer association between the two substances with a -0.31 partial correlation coefficient and a P = 0.02 level of significance.
Positivity rates for serological markers were 18% for gASCA, 25.6% for ALCA, 5% for AMCA and ALCA while actual median concentrations are presented in Table 4 . Additional associations were investigated by examining positivity for these serological markers and 442 January 21, 2017|Volume 23|Issue 3| WJG|www.wjgnet.com AHSG (in quartiles). Interestingly, an inverse association between serology and AHSG levels was recorded. IBD individuals who were seropositive, for at least one marker, had AHSG levels falling within the two lower quartiles (OR = 2.87, 95%CI: 1.51-5.45, P < 0.001) while those with at least two serological markers positive exhibited AHSG concentrations within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.12, 95%CI: 2.17-12.08, P < 0.001). Further analysis also considering potential confounding factors such as age, sex and smoking did not alter the reported associations significantly: OR = 2.86 (95%CI: 1.5-5.44) for single and OR = 5.03 (95%CI: 2.07-12.21) for multiple seropositivity (P < 0.001, in both cases).
In accordance with a preliminary report from our team in 2010, AHSG levels were downregulated in patients with IBD thus, allowing discrimination from IBS and HC individuals [29] . Furthermore, a more profound downregulation of AHSG was very well associated with complicated disease behavior and the need for biological anti-TNFα treatment or surgery. Additional associations with CRP and anti-glycan antibodies offered better insight into AHSG's link with acute-phase response and 443 January 21, 2017|Volume 23|Issue 3| WJG|www.wjgnet.com IBD course. The finding of an IBD-induced downregulation of AHSG is nothing but surprising since, AHSG levels decrease in the presence of robust inflammation [9, 11, 18] . Moreover, an interplay had already been documented between AHSG and the ""notorious"", in IBD, TNF-α and TGF-β [11] [12] [13] . An additional finding further confirming the tight link of AHSG with TNFα, was the discovery of a binding site for TNFα, within the AHSG gene. As a consequence of TNFα's binding on this region, the expression of AHSG gene is suppressed, leading to decreased AHSG production while other substances are favored-repriorisation of liver synthesis [8, [11] [12] [13] . Due to the magnitude and rather IBD-selective character of this suppression, however, an evaluation of AHSG's ability to differentiate between entities has been performed. When a cut-off of 0.44 g/L was used, AHSG levels were shown to discriminate IBD from IBS and HC with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%.
When magnitude of disease activity, as expressed through CDAI and CAI scores, was taken into consideration marginal differences were detected. According to the study by Ma et al [30] significant differences in AHSG levels exist between IBD patients with active or inactive disease. On the other hand, a correlation between AHSG and CRP was confirmed, in our study. This may be, at least in part, due to limitations of the indices themselves although one should bear in mind that apart from the negative acute phase protein properties attributed to AHSG, its downregulation is also a part of a more complex liver deregulation, resulting from an excessive uptake and processing of signals [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Perhaps, possible associations of AHSG with other indices should also be evaluated [31] [32] . At this point, however, an asset of the present study has to be underlined: the AHSG levels recorded in IBD patients correspond to a prior-to-therapy status and therefore, could not have been altered by any of the known drugs used to treat IBD.
A different set of results was obtained while examining AHSG levels with respect to UC extent and CD location. The recorded AHSG levels in this study could not predict disease location or extent and therefore, could not be used for this purpose.
This was not the case when disease behavior was taken into account. A further downregulation of AHSG was observed, in CD patients with stricturing or penetrating disease, compared to those with the ns/np subtype. This is not surprising as a more diffuse transmural inflammation would exert a stronger proinflammatory effect [33] . Moreover, in many organs inflammatory stress leads to fibrosis and subsequently tissue calcification [34] . From another pathogenetic perspective, a reason for the observed link between AHSG and stricturing disease could also be the reduced AHSG-induced counteraction of TGF-β's fibrogenic and antiproliferative potential [12, 13, 19] . Likewise, microvascular calcification, reduced blood flow and microthrombosis, exerted phenomena in the presence of low AHSG levels are also major findings during a chronic phase in the intestinal vasculature of IBD patients, leading to diminished intestinal perfusion and in turn to ulceration and fibrosis [21, 35] .
Another scopus of the present study was to test whether there is a link between AHSG levels and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations. The performed analysis did not reveal any associations between AHSG serum concentration and the presence of any extraintestinal manifestations. In this case, a limitation exists: the rather small number of IBD patients manifesting specific disorders i.e., urolithiasis.
A study focusing on the characteristics of IBD patients and AHSG levels was also performed. AHSG concentrations were compared among patients of different gender, smoking status and age at onset. None of these characteristics -male or female sex, current smoking or non-smoking habit and age at onset-could be linked with significant AHSG variations.
This was not the case when AHSG levels were evaluated with respect to treatment modalities adequately inducing and sustaining disease remission during the three-year follow-up period. A robust downregulation of AHSG levels correlated with the need for anti-TNFα therapy. This finding is within reason since, a more profound and persisting upregulation of TNFα, requiring subsequently the use of an anti-TNFα agent, would result in a greater AHSG decrease. As far as the link between AHSG levels and need for surgery, is concerned, one should also bear in mind that this subgroup predominantly consisted of CD patients with stricturing and penetrating disease. In the case of a refractory UC, requiring colectomy, safe conclusions could not be drawn due to the small number of colectomised patients, in our study.
The evidence mentioned above seems to make rather appealing the idea of AHSG's use as a diagnostic or even ""predictive"" tool rather tightly linked to IBD behavior as well as with markers related to it, such as the anti-glycan antibodies [36] . A prerequisite for this type of use is that its lack of a disease-specific nature, with similar fluctuations also reported in other disorders, is taken into account [9, 14, 17, 18] . A combined clinical and AHSG-based algorithm for the diagnosis of IBD, on the other hand, could help overcome this limitation.
Setting aside the already-performed diagnosticallyoriented interpretation of current results, a careful examination of AHSG's potential implication in the pathogenesis and complications of IBD, should also be performed. As already mentioned, AHSG is an inhibitor of unwanted, ectopic, tissue calcification and its decreased levels, as in this case, have been linked with excessive valvular and arterial calcification [4] . Although, initial reports originated from animal studies and those recruiting dialysis patients, similar results were obtained in patients with ischemic heart disease, alone [37] . Since a decrease in circulating AHSG is present in IBD, it would be logical to hypothesize that an accompanying reduced inhibition of vascular and valvular calcification would also be present. As this study was not designed to ""tackle"" these matters, the actual contribution of low AHSG levels in vascular changes and related acute or chronic ischemic events in IBD [38] , remains to be clarified.
Apart from the implication of AHSG in vascular pathology, another role, that of bone mineralisation has been identified [13] [14] [15] . Under the influence of AHSG, a ""reliable"", stress-resistant bone structure is formed, while in the absence of AHSG, minerals deposit outside fibrils, leading to defective osseous formation and finally osteoporosis [15] . As IBD patients are at high risk for osteoporosis, resulting from corticosteroids, malnutrition and inflammation-induced osteopenia [22] the examination of possible contribution of AHSG suppression for the onset of osteopenic manifestations might prove fruitful. In a rather similar manner, a defective coordination in mineral use, predominantly that of calcium, due to decreased AHSG levels, may lead to urolithiasis. Indeed, in the study of Stejskal et al [39] lower levels of AHSG in urine have been associated with the presence of urolithiasis. Although, in the case of IBD, wellestablished mechanisms-i.e., hyperoxaluria, reduced citric acid etc [18] -for urinary compications exist, when bearing in mind that still 80% of urinary stones consist of calcium salts it is within reason to test for additional candidates involved in calcium homeostasis and urinary manifestations, such as AHSG [40] . Conclusively, AHSG seems to emerge as a molecule of potential diagnostic and perhaps predictive value in IBD, as its downregulation shows a tight link with acute-phase. As well as with chronic inflammatory responses in both CD and UC. This link also encompasses the more challenging cases, those with complicated disease behavior, as well as those requiring advanced treatment strategies such as biological agents or surgery. As far as the pathogenetic role of AHSG in IBD is concerned, further studies designed to assess the impact and the association of low AHSG levels with respect to micro-and macro-vascular changes, skeletal and urinary complications recorded in patients with CD and UC, are needed.",α2-Heremans-schmid glycoprotein (fetuin A) downregulation and its utility in inflammatory bowel disease,"Manolakis, Anastassios C; Christodoulidis, Gregory; Kapsoritakis, Andreas N; Georgoulias, Panagiotis; Tiaka, Elisavet K; Oikonomou, Kostas; Valotassiou, Varvara J; Potamianos, Spyros P",World J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5291848/,363,4075,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,90cc93e5eac1e836f5cbce50fe92ded531045abf,"A method is described for the detection of certain nucleotide modifications adjacent to the 5' 7-methyl guanosine cap of mRNAs from individual genes. The method quantitatively measures the relative abundance of 2'-O-methyl and N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine, two of the most common modifications. In order to identify and quantitatify the amounts of N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine, a novel method for the synthesis of modified adenosine phosphoramidites was developed. This method is a one step synthesis and the product can directly be used for the production of N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine containing RNA oligonucleotides. The nature of the cap-adjacent nucleotides were shown to be characteristic for mRNAs from individual genes transcribed in liver and testis.","I n most eukaryotes, polymerase II (Pol II) dependent transcripts are modified co-transcriptionally at their 5'end by the addition of a 7-methyl guanosine (m 7 G) cap to the first nucleoside of the nascent transcript. If no additional modifications are made to the cap-adjacent nucleotides, the structure is referred to as a cap0. In yeast and plants, only cap0 structures are found, however, in animals, modifications of the two nucleotides adjacent to the m 7 G are possible The methylation of the first nucleotide on the ribose residue ( Fig. 1a) will form a cap1 structure 1 . Cap1 messages can be converted to cap2 structures if a further 2'ribose methylation takes place on the next nucleotide following the cap1 (Fig. 1b) . These methylation steps are sequential and carried out by nuclear located methylases [1] [2] [3] . In a transcript where the first nucleotide is an adenosine in a cap1 structure, a further methylation of the 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (Am) at the N 6 position of the adenine can take place to give N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m 6 Am) (Fig. 1c) 4 . The methyltransferase that carries out this modification has been partially characterized and appears to be predominantly located in the cytoplasm 5 . Transcription start sites of focused promoters are usually contained within an initiator motif (Inr) of general sequence YYANWYY (Y5pyrimidine, N-any nucleotide, W5A or T) where the A is the principal start site and neighbouring nucleotides may be used to varying degrees 6 . Since, A is often the first nucleotide after the m 7 G cap, its modification may have a functional role. In order to study the effect of m 6 Am present in cap1 messages, the chemical synthesis of RNA oligonucleotide sequences that contain m 6 Am in well-defined positions, is necessary. A number of methods exist in the literature for the preparation of N 6 -methylated adenosine derivatives, with the Dimroth rearrangement being perhaps the most well known [7] [8] [9] . This transformation relies upon an initial N1-methylation of the adenine ring followed by an alkali-mediated rearrangement to give the N6-methylated adenine product. An alternative method for accessing N6-alkylated adenines has been developed, which involves the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of adenine derivitives, that are activated at the 6-position, with amine nucleophiles (i.e. MeNH 2 ) [10] [11] [12] [13] . In order to obtain the N6-methylated phosphoramidite reagents from these adenine derivatives, a number of additional synthetic steps are required, which results in a 6 to 8 step synthesis being needed to produce each phosphoramidite reagent [10] [11] [12] [13] . Such approaches are not realistic other than in synthetic chemistry laboratories.
An interaction of m 7 G capped transcripts with the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) is important for promoting correct splicing 14 and 3'end formation 15 . After export from the nucleus, translation of most mRNAs is initiated with the recognition of the m 7 G cap by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) 16 . This cap binding step is usually rate-limiting for translation. The m 7 G cap also protects the message from 5' to 3' exonuclease digestion. Compared to the well characterised role of m 7 G, relatively little is known regarding the function of 2' ribose methylation on the following nucleotides. The presence of a cap1 structure may promote binding to ribosomes 17 and can increase translational efficiency in vitro 18, 19 . Many animal viruses encode their own cap1 methylases 20, 21 and this may also help them to limit host immune responses 22, 23 . Whilst viral cap1 methylases are common viral cap2 methylases and m 6 Am methylases have not been reported. However, m 6 Am and cap2 structures can be found in viral mRNAs in vivo, presumably as a result of the action of the host cell's enzymes 24 . The functional consequences for an mRNA of possessing m 6 Am in a cap1 or a cap2 structure are not known.
In order to investigate the roles of these cap-associated modifications, we have developed enzymatic techniques, in combination with thin layer chromatography (TLC) that allow the detection of m 6 Am and other cap nucleotides. We also describe a direct synthetic method for the preparation of the desired m 6 Am phosphoramidite reagent in a single step from commercially available starting material.
Through the use of this synthetic substrate we have demonstrated that a thin layer chromatography (TLC) method is quantitative for determining m 6 Am:Am ratios, and allows the relative proportions of Am and m 6 Am to be rapidly determined for mRNAs from different cell types and also for caps of messages from individual genes. We further give evidence that the relative proportion of m 6 Am varies in a characteristic way for mRNA from different mouse organs.
Synthesis and detection of N 6 , 2'-O-dimethyladenosine. We have previously used TLC assays to detect and quantify N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) 25 , a modification found internally in the mRNA of many eukaryotes [26] [27] [28] [29] . This method was modified to label and detect only the first nucleotide after the cap. In order to use this approach to compare the relative proportions of m 6 Am and Am in cap structures from different sources, it was first necessary to establish the mobility of m 6 Am in the TLC assay and to demonstrate that T4 polynucleotide kinase does not preferentially label either of these nucleotides. As neither m 6 Am triphosphate or m 6 Am phosphoramidite are commercially available, a novel method for its synthesis and incorporation into RNA oligonucleotides was developed.
In order to get quick access to the required m 6 Am phosphoramidite building block for solid-phase oligoribonucleotide synthesis, we performed a selective one-step methylation of the commercially available 2'-OMe-Bz-A-CE phosphoramidite. Due to its high reactivity and sensitivity towards acids and bases, Aritomo's relatively mild phase transfer catalysis (PTC) method was used 30 . Under these conditions (iodomethane, sodium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium bromide) the N 6 -methylated product was obtained as the major product in 56% yield, with the N 1 -methylated isomer being formed as a byproduct in 25% yield. Due to their different Rf values, the N 6 -and N 1 -methylated products were easily separated via column chromatography, and the purified m 6 Am phosphoramidite was used directly for RNA synthesis.
All oligoribonucleotides were synthesized using the standard protocol for solid-phase RNA synthesis with a 15 min coupling time per nucleotide. The last coupling step was followed by a standard DMTroff procedure, the oligoribonucleotides were removed from the solid support, deprotected, precipitated and desalted. MALDI mass spectrometry was used to confirm the mass of all RNA oligonucleotides produced Thin layer chromatography of modified adenosines. Radioactively 5' end labelled oligonucleotides SK-526 (m 6 AmGGGCUGCU) and SK-524 (AmGGGCUGCU) were digested to release pm 6 Am and pAm then mixed with a combination of 5' radioactive labelled pm 6 A and unmodified nucleotide monophosphates for which relative mobilities are well characterised. This mixture was separated by 2D TLC using the solvent systems previously described 25 to establish the position of pm 6 Am (Fig. 2) .
To show that T4 polynucleotide kinase does not preferentially label m 6 Am or Am, the RNA oligonucleotides SK-524 and SK-526 were mixed in different ratios, end labelled, digested with P1 nuclease and separated by TLC. The spots corresponding to pm 6 Am and pAm were then quantified using phosphorimaging. The results demonstrated that both nucleotides are labelled with equal efficiency by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fig. 3) Labelling and analysis of the first cap adjecent nucleotide. To label the first nucleotide following the m 7 G, poly(A) RNA was prepared from various mouse organs then digested with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the m 7 G cap. The exposed 5' ends were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase and after phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the mRNA transcripts were radiolabelled at their 5' end using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of .20 fold excess of [c-32 P] ATP. The labelled RNA was digested to monophospho-nucleotides by P1 nuclease prior to TLC separation. Using this method, new spots corresponding to the 2'-O methylated nucleotides are apparent in the labelled samples after cap removal (Fig 4A) . A spot corresponding to pm 6 Am is readily detectable in all mRNA samples tested, and with pm 6 Am:pAm ratios of between 15:1 (brain) and 2:1 (liver) it appears that m 6 Am is more prevalent at the cap1 than is Am (Fig. 4A ). Under these labelling conditions, where both ATP and polynucleotide kinase are in excess, the intensity of the spots corresponding to the unmodified Analysis of cap structures for mRNA transcripts from individual genes. In order to assay modifications on the first transcribed nucleotide for messages from individual genes, mRNA from liver and testis was de-capped and end-labelled as described above then fragmented to ,120 nt. This was then hybridised to single stranded DNA targets corresponding to the 5' region of selected messages. These DNA targets were first cross-linked to 2 mm 3 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N 1 membrane. After hybridization and washing, the membrane was subjected to phosphorimaging (Fig. 4B) . The individual teeth containing the labelled mRNA gene-specific fragments were then removed and digested to nucleotide 5' monophosphates using P1 nuclease. These samples were individually spotted onto TLC plates and developed as described (Fig. 4B ). Four mRNAs were chosen for analysis, apolipoprotein A-I (Apoa1, BC012253), albumin (Alb, BC024643), protamine 2 (Prm2, BC049612) and poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (Pabpc1, BC046233). Alb and Apoa1 are predominantly liver expressed messages, whereas Prm2 shows testis specific expression and Pabpc1 is expressed highly in both organs. Pabpc1 may be subjected to translational regulation, but unlike Pabpc2, it is present in actively translating polyribosomes of mouse testicular cells 31 . For both Alb and Apoa1, the labelled nucleotide in the cap adjacent position included A, G, U and C, as well as m 6 Am and Am. This is consistent with multiple alternative transcription start sites at and around the Inr 32 . In both cases, Am and m 6 Am appeared as the major nucleotide modifications; unlike the mixed mRNA starting material, 2'-O-methylcytosine was not present (compare Fig. 4A, B) . The m 6 Am:Am ratios were 1.65:1 and 1.4:1 for Apoa1 and Alb respectively, which is only slightly lower compared to that seen for the liver mRNA population as a whole. The Prm2 mRNAs from testis tissues almost exclusively had m 6 Am at the cap adjacent position (Fig. 4B) . With an m 6 Am:Am ratio of 40:1, this was four times larger than the m 6 Am:Am ratio for the testis mRNA population as a whole. In contrast the cap adjacent nucleotides of Pabpc1 transcripts were predominantly unmodified, although a pronounced 2'-O-methyluridine was apparent in the sample from testis (Fig. 4B ).
Core promoters of Pol II transcribed genes may be focused, directing transcription initiation at a single site or cluster of adjacent sites, or they may be dispersed and have multiple start sites over a region of 50-100 nucleotides 6 . In case of focused promoters the transcription start sites are contained within and around the Inr (YYANWYY), where the A is the principal start site and surrounding nucleotides are utilised to varying degrees 6 . Recent high-throughput sequencing from full length mRNAs, suggests that purine instead of A may be a better representation of the Inr consensus. However, most core promoters have several closely arrayed transcription start sites with different initiation rates rather than initiating at a single nucleotide 32 . Thus, most genes will give rise to a population of mRNAs that differ in their starting nucleotides. For example the Prm2 message initiates predominantly at the central A of the Inr as well as a second A 3 nucleotides upstream, whereas, Apoa1 strongly initiates at the A of the Inr but also uses surrounding U, G, C and sites at a significant level (Supplementary Figure S2 online) and (Fig. 4B) .
Conversion of an adenosine following the m 7 G cap to Am (cap1) can be followed by further conversion to m 6 Am (Fig. 1a, and 1c) . It is not known if this Am to m 6 Am conversion preferentially targets certain messages, or if the Am:m 6 Am ratio for messages from any one gene is merely a reflection of the general m 6 Am methylase activity of a particular cell type. The enzyme responsible for the formation of m 6 Am has been partially characterised 5 . It appears to be a cytosolic enzyme and is distinct from METTL3/MT-A70, the nuclear enzyme responsible for the formation of m 6 A at internal positions within mRNA 33 .
Whilst there is evidence that cap1 methylation may increase translation efficiency 18, 19 , the consequences of converting a cap1 Am to m 6 Am are largely unknown. Some crystallographic observations suggest that the first nucleotide after the m7G may influence interaction with eIF4E or other cap binding proteins. Crystallographic analysis of eIF4E in a complex with the dinucleotide m 7 GpppG, show the G in a disordered arrangement 34 . However, with m 7 GpppA as substrate, the A interacts with a C-terminal loop of the protein 35 . A key interaction of this C-loop is a hydrogen bond between Thr 205 and the amino group in the N 6 position of the adenosine. It is this amino group that is targeted for methylation by the m 6 Am methylase. Thus, N 6 methylation of a cap1 adenosine might influence the flexibility and orientation of the eIF4E C-terminal loop region. The ability to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides that containe m 6 Am in welldefined positions should facilitate future structure-function analysis. Therefore a direct synthetic method for the preparation of the desired m 6 Am phosphoramidite reagent, in a single step from commercially available starting material via direct N 6 -methylation, dramatically improves access to these materials for biological evaluation.
Preparation of 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite. 59-(4,49-Dimethoxytrityl)-6-N-benzoyl-6-N-methyl-adenosine,29-O-methyl-39-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite (2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite) was prepared as follows: tetrabutylammonium bromide (260 mg, 807 mmol) and aq. NaOH (1M, 7 ml) were added to a stirring solution of 2'-OMe-Bz-A-CE phosphoramidite (Link Technologies, 708 mg, 797 mmol) and iodomethane (200 ml, 3.21 mmol) in dichloromethane (7 ml). After vigorous stirring for 30 min, ether and water were added and the resulting layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with ether, the combined organic extracts were dried over Na 2 SO 4 and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite was readily purified by column chromatography (1:1 petrol/etherR9:1 ether/methanol) affording 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite (403 mg, 56%, white foam, 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers) and 2'-OMe-Bz-m 1 A-CE phosphoramidite (182 mg, 25%, white foam, 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers). Data for 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite and for 2'-OMe-Bz-m 1 A-CE phosphoramidite are presented in Supplementary Table S1. online.
Synthesis of oligoribonucleotides SK-524 and SK-526. Oligoribonucleotides SK-524(AmGGGCUGCU) and SK-526(m 6 AmGGGCUGCU) were synthesized on an ABI 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer and mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ultraflex III mass spectrometer via MALDI-TOF. Columns (SynBaseTM CPG 1000Å , RNA: 0.2 mmol), apart from the 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite, standard RNA-phosphoramidites and reagents for the synthesizer were purchased from Link Technologies Ltd., MeNH 2 solution (33 wt.% in ethanol) was obtained from Fluka, NEt 3 N3HF, N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (HPA) and DowexTM 50WX8-200 were purchased from Aldrich, illustra Nap TM -10 columns were obtained from GE Healthcare Europe GmbH. Dichloromethane and acetonitrile were freshly distilled from CaH 2 before use on the synthesizer.
The RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using a standard 0.2 mM scale protocol, but with a 15 min coupling time for each nucleotide addition step. The polymer-bound oligoribonucleotide was transferred from the synthesis column to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and suspended in MeNH 2 solution (1 ml). The mixture was heated to 65 uC for 10 min, cooled to room temperature (water/icebath) and centrifuged for 1 min (10,000 g). The supernatant was separated from the CPG beads, the beads were washed with RNase free water (2 3 0.25 ml), all supernatants were combined and dried (2 h under nitrogen stream, then freeze dried). The oligoribonucleotide was resuspended in anhydrous NEt 3 N3HF/NEt 3 /NMP solution (250 ml of a solution of 1.5 ml NMP, 750 mlNEt 3 and 1.0 ml NEt 3 N3HF), heated to 65 uC for 1.5 h, cooled to room temperature and quenched with 3M NaOAc solution (25 ml). n-BuOH (1 ml) was added to the mixture, which was then thoroughly mixed, cooled to 270 uC for 1 -2 h to encourage further precipitation and centrifuged for 30 min (4 uC, 13 000 g). The supernatant was removed, the pellet washed with 70% EtOH (2 3 500 ml) and then dried in vacuo (30 min). The dry precipitate was dissolved in RNase free water (1 ml) and desalted using a Nap TM -10 column following the standard protocol. The resulting solution was freeze dried over night leaving the oligoribonucleotide as a white foam/powder. Samples for MALDI-mass spectrometry were prepared as follows 36 : Dowex TM ion-exchange beads were rigorously cleaned with dilute HCl, washed with water, then treated with dilute NH 3 and finally washed with water again to generate Dowex-NH 4 1 . Diammonium citrate (DAC) (100 mg) was dissolved in water (1 ml) and HPA (34.8 mg) was dissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile/ water (1 ml). The HPA solution was filtered through Dowex-NH 4 1 and the DAC solution (100 ml) was added to prepare the matrix stock. Prior to MALDI-MS acquisition, matrix stock (20 ml) was mixed with Dowex-NH 4 1 (5 ml) and each oligoribonucleotide sample (1 ml) was mixed with Dowex-NH 4 1 (19 ml). After 30 min the matrix, and after drying, the sample solution (0.5ml) were spotted onto the sample well and allowed to dry prior to confirmatory analysis by MALDI-MS.
RNA purification. Total RNA was prepared from mouse (C57BL/6) tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The poly(A) RNA was purified twice using oligo(dT) cellulose (Fluka) followed by oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen). All samples were quantified and assayed for poly(A) purity using an Agilent Bioanalyser.
Analysis of gene-specific mRNA cap structures. Regions corresponding to the first 300 to 500 nucleotides of the target messages were PCR amplified from cDNAs using the following oligonucleotides:
Apoa1forward GCTCCGGGGAGGTCACCCACACCT and Apoa1reverse CAATGGGCCCAGCCGTTCCTGCAGC; Albforward CCCCACTAGCCTCTGGCAAAATGAAGTG and Albreverse GGCTGGGGTTGTCATCTTTGTGTTGCAG; Prm2forward GCTGGGTGTGCGCGAGTCAGGGGCTC and Prm2reverse CTTGTGGATCCTATGTAGCCTCTTACG; Pabpc1forward CGGCGGTTAGTGCTGAGAGTGCGGAG and Pabpc1reverse GAAGTTCACGTACGCGTAGCCCAAGG. Prior to amplification, the forward oligonucleotides were 5' phosphorylated, the amplification products were subsequently digested with lambda nuclease (New England BioLabs) to leave the single stranded antisense DNA strand. 100 ng of this ssDNA (2 ml) was spotted onto 2 mm 3 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N 1 membrane ( Amersham) (Fig. 2B,C) , and UV cross-linked (Stratalinker). Membranes were prehybridised at 42 uC in 40 % formamide with 5 3 Denhardt's, 3 % SDS, 0.3 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.1 mg ml 21 sonicated salmon sperm DNA. 600 ng of poly(A) RNA was digested with 20 units of Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (Epicentre) for 30 minutes at 37 uC. The 5' phosphate of the exposed cap adjacent nucleotide was removed by the addition of 10 units of Alkaline Phosphatase (Fermentas) and incubation for a further 15 minutes at 37 uC. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA samples were resuspended in 20 ml of sterile distilled water and 5' ends were labelled using 30 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK, Fermentas) and 7.4 MBq [c-32 P] ATP at 37 uC for 30 minutes. The PNK was heat inactivated (70 uC for 15 min) and the reaction made up to 60 ml with sterile distilled water then passed through a P-30 spin column (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated isotope. A 1 ml aliquot was taken, added to 9 ml of nuclease P1 buffer and digested with P1 (Sigma) for one hour at 37 uC. 1.5 ml of the released 5' monophosphates from this digest was then analysed by 2D TLC as described previously 25 . The remaining end labelled RNA was fragmented to lengths of approximately 120 nt by the addition of Na 2 CO 3 to a final concentration of 60 mM and NaHCO 3 to a final concentration of 40 mM followed by incubation for one hour at 60 uC.12 ml 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2 was then added and the RNA precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of pre-hybridisation buffer then added to the membranes (final volume 2 ml) and hybridised overnight at 42 uC. Membrane washings were carried out with 2 3, 1 3 and 0.2 3 SSC, 0.1% SDS. Two final washes were carried out at 60 uC, with 0.2 3 SSC but with the SDS omitted. Hybridised membranes were exposed to storage phosphor screens (K-screen; KODAK) and imaged using Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX in combination with Quantity One 4.6.3 software (Bio-Rad). Individual teeth containing the target mRNAs end labelled at the cap adjacent position were cut off and digested with P1 nuclease (Sigma) in a final volume of 3 ml. All of this digestion mix was applied to a cellulose coated TLC plate (20 3 20 cm, MERCK) and developed as described previously 25 .",A novel synthesis and detection method for cap-associated adenosine modifications in mouse mRNA,"Kruse, Susanne; Zhong, Silin; Bodi, Zsuzsanna; Button, James; Alcocer, Marcos J.

The majority of these infections in children are of viral etiology. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of viral ARI among children in Lebanon. Patients and Methods: Children presenting with symptoms of ARI were prospectively recruited between September 2009 to February 2012. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from patients and screened for 11 respiratory viruses using a multiplex Luminex-based PCR assay. Results: Two hundred twenty-one patients were recruited with a median age of 1 year (IQR: 0 -5). Out of 221 patients, 116 (52.5%) were positive for at least one virus, the majority (103/116; 88.8%) of which were in children under 6-year of age. Overall, 188 viruses were detected. Rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common virus detected in 81 (69.8%) patients followed by coxsackie virus and echovirus (CVEV) which were detected as one target in the panel in 45 (38.8%), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV types : 1, 2, 3, 4) in 24 (20.7%) patients. Coinfection with more than one virus was detected in 49 (42.9%) patients. RhV and CVEV were the most common viruses associated with co-infections and higher risk of rhinorrhea. Conclusions: Viral pathogens account for at least half of the ARIs in Lebanon, with a high frequency of co-infections being detected.","Introduction. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) are among the most common reasons for primary care consultations. 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks ARIs as the fourth major killer after cardiovascular diseases, general infections and parasitic diseases, and cancer. 2 ARIs cause 4 million death globally. The burden is especially high in children where ARIs are responsible for 11-22% of deaths. 3 ARIs can lead to severe complications requiring hospitalizations and can have fatal outcomes.
Viruses are the most common etiology of ARIs in children. 6, 7 These include rhinovirus (RhV), respiratory www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2019; 11; e2019059
Pag. 2 / 7 syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (IFN), parainfluenza virus (PIV), coronavirus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), enteroviruses (EV), adenovirus (AdV), and human bocavirus (HBoV). 6, 8, 9 Each of these viruses poses a significant health burden. Nair et al. estimated that 111 500 deaths in children <5 years were attributable to influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) in 2008, the vast majority of which occurred in developing countries. 10 RSV was estimated to have caused 33.8 million LRI episode in children under five, of which 3.4 million were severe causing up to 199 000 deaths. 11 In addition to the health burden of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs), the economic impact is also high if we account for health care costs (direct cost) and loss of productivity (indirect cost). A study by Fendrik et al. estimated the total economic impact of non-influenzarelated viral RTIs in the United States at $40 billion annually. 12 The advancements that have been achieved in developing antiviral drugs, some of which have already been approved, against respiratory viruses allow for targeted therapy of viral ARIs. [13] [14] [15] This possibility calls for better and faster diagnosis of the etiologic agents in ARI patients to benefit from the full potential of these drugs. 6 Furthermore, ARIs are associated with the greatest amount of excess use of antibiotics that has led to unprecedented increase in antimicrobial drug resistance; 16, 17 therefore, proper and timely diagnosis of viral infections can help reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. 5, 6 In Lebanon, studies investigating the viral etiologies of ARIs are very scarce. In this study, we determined the viral etiologies among ARI patients at a tertiary care hospital that serves an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patient population.
Patients and samples collection. Infants and children younger than 18 years of age with symptoms of ARI disease presenting to the emergency department or the departments of pediatrics of the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), Beirut, Lebanon were prospectively recruited between September 2009 to February 2012. An ARI was defined as an acute infection of the upper and lower respiratory airways. Recruited patients had one or more of the following symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache, conjunctivitis, wheezing, dyspnea, and vomiting.
Medical history and demographic data were obtained from the patients and their medical records. A respiratory sample was collected and stored at -80°C for viral assessment. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the AUBMC, and written informed consent was obtained from all parents.
Nucleic acid extraction and viral detection. Nucleic acid was extracted from clinical specimens by using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 200 µl aliquot of each specimen was used for nucleic extraction. Specimens were then analyzed by the ResPlex II panel (Qiagen) using the manufacturer's protocol.
The ResPlex II panel can detect 11 viral targets: RSVA, RSVB, INFA, INFB, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, hMPV, CVEV (coxsackievirus and echovirus), and RhV. Briefly, 10 µl of each specimen were added to 40 µl reverse transcription-PCR (ResPlex II) master mix, including the supplied primers. Targets were detected by mixing 5 µl portions of amplification products with ResPlex II bead in hybridization buffer at 52°C for10 min. Streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate was added, and mixtures were incubated at 52°C for a further 5 min before the addition of stop buffer. The samples were then analyzed on a Luminex Bio-Rad BioPlex 200 System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using Bio-Rad BioPlex Manager software. The cutoff value for each target was determined, as previously described by Lia et al. 19 Statistical analysis. The data were checked for completeness, and responses were coded and entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23 for Windows, which was later used for statistical analyses. 32 Descriptive statistics were presented to summarize the study variables of interest as counts and percentages for the categorical variables and as medians and Interquartile Range (IQR) for the continuous ones. The Chi-square test was used to calculate the association between two categorical variables. Pearson's chi-square analysis with Bonferroni-Holm p-value correction was used for multiple comparisons to assess infectivity enhancing correlations. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine which factors are associated with rhinorrhea. In the regression model, rhinorrhea was used as the dependent variable. Odds ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For all analysis done, a pvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Patient characteristics. A total of 221 specimens were collected from children presenting with symptoms of ARI between September 2009 and February 2012 ( Table 1) . The socio-demographic characteristics of the study patients are presented in Table 1 . Overall, the study consisted of 130 males (58.8%) and 91 females (41.2%) with patients' median age of 1 (IQR: 0 -5) years. Seventy-four patients (33.5%) were children under one year of age, 105 (47.5%) were between 1 to 6 years old, 33 (14.9%) were 6 to 12 years old, and 9 (4.1%) were 12 to 18 years old. Sixty-seven (30.3%) of the children had an underlying disease (asthma, immune-deficiency, allergic rhinitis, or cystic fibrosis). At the time of diagnosis 13 (5.8%) patients were receiving chemotherapy, and 95 (43%) had received an antibiotic.
Virological characterization. Samples were screened for 11 virus targets included in the ResPlexII respiratory panel. Of the 221 ARI episodes, 116 (52.5%) were confirmed to be of viral etiology being positive for at least one of the virus targets tests ( Table  2 ). The majority (n=103; 88%) of viral ARI episodes were observed in children under 6-year of age (chisquare, p<0.05). Figure 1 shows the frequency of each of the viruses detected in the study population. Overall 188 viruses were detected. Rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common virus detected in 81 (69.8%) patients followed Cystic fibrosis 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 2) . A significant majority (n=46; 93.9%; chi-square p-value<0.05) of coinfections occurred in children under six years of age. The most frequent viral co-infections involved two viruses (n=33), 10 cases had a triple infection, 5 had four viruses detected, and one case had five viruses. Almost half cases of Rhinovirus (50.6%) were positive for at least another virus in the panel. CVEV positive cases also had a high rate of coinfection (73%). Moreover, hMPV and INFB were detected in 9 samples, and all were co-infected. Table 3 summarizes the correlation of different viruses among our patients. Several correlations enhancing infectivity were evident in our analysis. Of note, RhV was the most frequently detected virus in co-infections and was significantly associated with RSVB, INFB, PIV3, hMPV, and CVEV.
Underlying conditions and clinical presentation. We next analyzed the correlation between each of the viral etiologies or co-infection with the underlying conditions ( Table 2) . To simplify the analysis, we treated subtypes or genotypes of a virus as a single group (e.g. RSV for RSVA and RSVB, etc.). Having an underlying condition or receiving chemotherapy or a course of antibiotics were not found to be a risk factor for having a viral etiology or co-infection ( Table 2) . Additionally, we investigated the seasonal variation of viruses. Rhinovirus infections were detected throughout the year however the peak rate occurred during the main rainy months (November, December), likely for Coxsackie/Echovirus and RSV. On the other hand,Influenza A virus infections had a peak in the fall (September, October); (Figure 3 ). In terms of clinical symptoms, fever, cough and rhinorrhea were major symptoms observed in most of the patients infected with one or more respiratory virus ( Table 2) . Chisquare analysis revealed a significant correlation between rhinorrhea and INF, CVEV, and RhV and coinfection ( Table 2) . Bivariate logistic regression was then performed to determine the risk associated with these infections. Our analysis revealed that RhV or A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the correlates of rhinorrhea in the study patients. Variables were put in the model in order of strength of their correlation with rhinorrhea as per the bivariate analysis. The effect of each variable on the model was assessed, and the variable was kept if it significantly contributed to a better fit of the model. The final model included the following variables: RhV and CVEV. The results of the multivariate model showed that CVEV was independently associated with rhinorrhea (OR: 4.73; CI: 1.59 -14.07). CVEV infected patients were 4.73 times more likely to have rhinorrhea compared to none-CVEV patients controlling for RhV. Unlike the bivariate analysis, RhV was not significantly associated with rhinorrhea (OR: 1.78; CI: 0.91 -3.48). RhV infected patients were 1.78 times more likely to have rhinorrhea compared to none-RhV patients controlling for CVEV; however, this was not statistically significant.
Discussion. We demonstrated that viral infections are responsible for at least half of the ARIs in children in Lebanon. Rhinovirus infection was the most common etiology of ARI consistent with other studies from Lebanon and other countries. 18, 20, 21 In neighboring Jordan and Egypt rhinovirus incidence was second to RSV, but the population captured in these studies was younger than that included in our study. 22, 23 The overall viral ARI incidence (52.5%) in our study lower than that recently reported by Finianos et al. (70%) in Lebanon. 18 Both studies targeted children; however, Finianos et al. screened their specimens for more viral targets than those included in our analysis. In our study we did not test for HCoV, AdV, EV, and HBoV which collectively accounted for 50% of viral ARI in the study by Finianos et al.
The coinfection rate in our study (42.9%) was higher than that previously reported in Lebanon (37%), Qatar (21.4%), and Egypt (10.8%). 18, 23, 24 This incongruence could be because CVEV, which was frequently detected with other viruses in our study, was not screened in the previous studies from the region. 18 CVEV infections are not commonly reported in studies investigating respiratory infections. In our study, CVEV infection constituted 38.8% of all viral ARI cases and was independently associated with rhinorrhea. This incidence is much higher than that reported in other countries. A recent study in Latin America reported that CVEV was associated with 3% of the ARI cases. 25 In Central America, CVEV was even much lower (0.3%). 26 The very low prevalence of CVEV in other regions might have discouraged its testing. Given the high prevalence of CVEV in Lebanon, we recommend testing for enteroviruses, including (CVEV).
Co-infections were found to be more common younger children in Lebanon, and that is similar to a previous study done in Mexican children showing that the majority of coinfections occur in children <6 months of age. 27 Younger children are likely to be more prone to infections due to their lack or still weak immunity to respiratory viruses. The effect of coinfections on disease outcomes is not well understood. 28 Patients coinfected with pandemic H1N1 influenza and rhinovirus tended to have milder clinical severity when compared with non-rhinovirus coinfections; 29 while the patients coinfected with HMPV and RSV were prone to a higher risk of severe bronchiolitis. 30 Additionally, the prevalence and severity of obstructive airway disease were higher in patients with coinfections. 31 In our study, coinfection was associated with higher risk of rhinorrhea but not with more severe symptoms like dyspnea. In contrast, some studies showed no correlation between coinfection status and clinical severity. 32, 33 The complexity of viral coinfections and the large number of respiratory viruses involved make challenging to study the effect of coinfection on disease outcome in a clinical setting. Therefore, there is a need for developing in vitro or in vivo models to allow a better understanding of coinfections. For example, dual infection with INF was shown to suppress RSV growth in vitro. 34 The suppression of RSV by INF was suggested to be due to competition for protein synthesis and budding from the cell surface. Further studies are warranted to investigate the interactions among respiratory viruses during coinfection and their effect on the host.
Our study had a couple of limitations. First, we have not screened for HBoV, and HCoV which are not included in ResPlex II kit and thus the prevalence of viral ARI is expected to be higher than 52%. Another limitation was our inability to rule out bacterial etiologies which was not tested for in the current study. In conclusion, viral etiologies contribute to a large proportion of ARIs many of which involve more than one viral agent.",Viral Etiology of Acute Respiratory Infections in Pediatric Patients in Lebanon,"Masoud, Khaldoun; Hanna-Wakim, Rima; Zaraket, Hassan; Kharroubi, Samer; Araj, George F; Matar, Ghassan M; Dbaibo, Ghassan",Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6827722/,218,2188,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ReFeRenCes","M iddle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MeRS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that was reported for the first time in June 2012, in Saudi Arabia in a patient with pneumonia. 1 Later, many other cases of pneumonia due to MeRS-CoV infection have been reported in other countries such as united Kingdom 2 and Germany. 3 A majority of the patients diagnosed with MeRS-CoV infection require hospitalization to the intensive care unit (iCu) and mechanical ventilation. in-hospital mortality is very high and is expected to reach 65%. 4
Case A previously healthy 60-year-old man presented to the emergency room because of a 4-day history of fever, shortness of breath, cough with yellowish sputum, and left side chest pain, which was worsened by inspiration. Physical examination showed a body temperature of 38°C, blood pressure of 115/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 24 per minute. the jugular venous pressure was elevated, as assessed clinically. the novel Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MeRS-CoV) has been identified as a cause of pneumonia; however, it has not been reported as a cause of acute myocarditis. A 60-year-old man presented with pneumonia and congestive heart failure. On the first day of admission, he was found to have an elevated troponin-i level and severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography. the serum creatinine level was found mildly elevated. Chest radiography revealed in the lower lung fields accentuated bronchovascular lung markings and multiple small patchy opacities. Laboratory tests were negative for viruses known to cause myocarditis. Sputum sample was positive for MeRS-CoV. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance revealed evidence of acute myocarditis. the patient had all criteria specified by the international Consensus Group on CMR in Myocarditis that make a clinical suspicion for acute myocarditis. this was the first case that demonstrated that MeRS-CoV may cause acute myocarditis and acute-onset heart failure. his chest revealed widespread crackles.
Laboratory tests obtained on admission showed an elevated troponin-I level of 1.13 µg/L and an elevated pro-brain natriuretic peptide level of 6000 pg/ml, which increased to 8906 pg/ml on the second day. White blood cell count was 7.4×10 3 per mm 3 , which increased to 18×10 3 per mm 3 on the third day as the highest level (with 68% neutrophils and 27% lymphocytes). Serum creatinine level was mildly elevated, to 120 µmol/L. Chest radiography revealed accentuated bronchovascular lung markings and multiple small patchy opacities present in the lower lung fields. Another chest radiography performed 3 days later revealed that the opacities had become larger and denser (Figure 1) . electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 120 beats per minute and diffuse t-wave inversion. Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the first day showed severe global left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and small pericardial effusion.
the patient was admitted to the iCu as a case of pneumonia and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g ev-ery 6 hours and azithromycin 500 mg once daily). He also received furosemide intravenously for congestive heart failure. Routine sputum and blood cultures were negative for bacterial infections.
A differential diagnosis of the severe LV dysfunction included myopericarditis, ischemic cardiomyopathy presented with acute coronary syndrome, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Myopericarditis was supported by chest pain description. the elevated level of troponin could be attributed to any 1 of the possibilities discussed here.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed using a 1.5-T Siemens scanner. Multislice, T1weighted (T1w), inversion-recovery gradient-echo sequences, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images were acquired 10 minutes after injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadoterate (a gadolinium-containing contrast agent). t2weighted (t2w) short-tau inversion recovery (t2w-StiR) images were obtained before contrast administration.
LGe images revealed a linear pattern of increased signals in sub-epicardial regions of inferior and lateral walls of the left ventricle (Figure 2a) . this pattern of LGe is consistent with myocarditis. 5-8 t2w images assessed visually showed an increased signal intensity at the apical and lateral walls of the left ventricle ( Figure 2B) . this is evidence of myocardial edema and acuteness of the myocardial injury. 8, 9 Laboratory tests were negative for viruses known to cause myocarditis: influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, coxsackievirus B, parvovirus B19, echovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Bacterial blood cultures were negative for any growth.
As a result of published reports on MeRS-CoV fatal infection in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Ministry of Health requested that all patients with pneumonia requiring admission to the iCu be tested for MeRS-CoV. A sample of the patient's sputum was sent for reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction assay, which was positive for MeRS-CoV.
During the second week of admission, the patient required hemodialysis because of acute renal failure, which improved after 4 weeks. He also required intubation for mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure that continued for 6 weeks. He was then transferred to the general admission ward and stayed there for about 1 month for rehabilitation. LV systolic function remained severely impaired on echocardiography performed 3 months after the first one. He was discharged home when his clinical condition was stable.
the clinical presentation of patients with acute myocarditis varies, ranging from a subclinical disease to a ful-minant heart failure and cardiogenic shock. According to the european Study of epidemiology and treatment of Inflammatory Heart Disease, 72% of patients had dyspnea, 32% had chest pain, and 18% had arrhythmias. 10 The patient had all criteria specified by the international Consensus Group on CMR in Myocarditis that make a clinical suspicion for acute myocarditis. 8 the patient had left side chest pain suggestive of pericarditis, evidence of myocardial injury (elevated troponin and severe global LV dysfunction on the first day of presentation), and confirmed viral infection. The elevated level of troponin is known to occur in about 35% of myocarditis cases. 11 Acute myocarditis can be confidently diagnosed using CMR. 5-8 the signal response from normal myocardi- LGe image in short-axis view. Arrows point to the sub-epicardial accumulation of contrast in the inferior and lateral walls. Panel B shows t2w short-tau inversion recovery (t2w-StiR) image in a short-axis view. There is an increased myocardial signal intensity, which is more prominent in the lateral and inferior walls. um is reduced during LGE imaging, revealing areas with increased accumulation of gadolinium as bright regions that has been shown to reflect a myocardial injury. In this case, the distribution of LGE in the sub-epicardial region is consistent with myocarditis. Myocardial injury due to myocarditis can be easily differentiated from an ischemic injury, as the latter results in sub-endocardial involvement on LGe images. 8 LGe is generally absent in stress-induced cardiomyopathy. 12 t2w-StiR imaging is used to detect tissue edema, which indicates acuteness of the myocardial injury. 8, 9 When both criteria, i.e.,
LGE and presence of edema, are met, the diagnosis of acute myocarditis can be made with an excellent specificity of 91% when validated by endomyocardial biopsy. 13 A third criterion that supports the diagnosis is an increased global myocardial early enhancement ratio between the myocardium and skeletal muscle in gadolinium-enhanced t1w images. 8 For the patient in this study, the skeletal muscle mass size in obtained images was not satisfactory for assessment and, thus, certain criterion could not be applied. However, in the setting of clinically suspected myocarditis, 2 criteria are required to diagnose acute myocarditis according to the international Consensus Group on CMR in Myocarditis (Lake Louise Consensus Criteria). 8 no improvement in LV systolic function was observed on echocardiography performed 3 months after the first one. This was not surprising, as among patients with acute myocarditis presented with severe LV dysfunction, about 50% developed chronic ventricular systolic dysfunction. 14,15 this case report demonstrates that MeRS-CoV may cause acute myocarditis and acute-onset heart failure.

104,7a920d6b53c292f53323cb6c5109732a9575e33c,"Despite the significant progress in the recent efforts toward developing an effective vaccine against toxoplasmosis, the search for new protective vaccination strategy still remains a challenge and elusive goal because it becomes the appropriate way to prevent the disease. Various experimental approaches in the past few years showed that developing a potential vaccine against the disease can be achievable. The combination of multi-epitopes expressing different stages of the parasite life cycle has become an optimal strategy for acquiring a potent, safe, and effective vaccine. Epitope-based vaccines have gained attention as alternative vaccine candidates due to their ability of inducing protective immune responses. This mini-review highlights the current status and the prospects of Toxoplasma gondii vaccine development along with the application of epitope-based vaccine in the future parasite immunization as a novel under development and evaluation strategy.
ARTICLE HISTORY","Toxoplasmosis is a prevalent disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), which is a zoonotic parasite that infects humans, domestic, and wild mammals [1, 2] . It is a significant, life-threatening disease with medical, veterinary, and economic importance worldwide [3, 4] . Immunocompetent individuals infected with toxoplasmosis are usually asymptomatic or might have mild symptoms, while, this disease in immunocompromised patients can be quite severe or even fatal [5, 6] . Despite several available antiparasitic chemical drugs used to prevent or cure the infection and to limit and control the spread of T. gondii parasite in an infected host, these drugs still have limited efficacy and are not absolutely safe and could cause severe side effects [7] [8] [9] . Thus, acquiring safe and effective vaccine to control the vital impact of toxoplasmosis in both humans and animals is urgently needed [10] .
Intensive efforts and significant advances toward acquiring an effective vaccine are under way to control infection and limit the incidence of the disease; however, no vaccine has, thus, far been available for use in humans [11] [12] [13] . Currently, the live attenuated tachyzoites of the strain S48 (commercially named ""Toxovax"") is the only approved vaccine for veterinary use. This vaccine was unfortunately shown limited efficacy [14] .
Consequently, numerous studies on toxoplasmosis vaccination have been conducted and different forms of the parasite or parasitic antigens were tested, including inactivated or life attenuated vaccine, crude or recombinant antigen, subunit or multi-antigenic vaccines, and DNA vaccine [15] . Interestingly, the results indicated acquiring an effective vaccine against toxoplasmosis can be achieved.
The lack of available vaccine highlights the needs of exploring alternative reagents that can be used for immunization purposes. Further discussion was conducted to address the challenges, along with difficulties to acquire potential vaccine construct. Many suggestions were proposed and put forward in order to identify possible directions of the future research studies on the development of potential vaccines against T. gondii. In response to this scenario, the scientific suggestions were based on paying special focus on multi-epitope antigens that contain various immunoreactive epitopes of different T. gondii antigens. The potential use of the epitope-based antigen was explored to develop a new approach that expected to meet the demand of achievement of an effective vaccine. Characterization and identification of immunogenic epitopes from organism antigens could help in developing sensitive diagnostic assays, potential vaccines, as well as effective therapeutic agents [16] .
The application of epitope-based vaccine in the immunization attempts of various infections has shown encouraging results and proved to stimulate protective cellular and humoral immunity [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Accordingly, epitope-based vaccine has suggested as a new potential candidates for acquiring a novel and effective T. gondii vaccine.
To date, the large number of immunization attempts highlight that future T. gondii vaccination approaches should apply antigens with potential to stimulate protective immunity against the parasite and are expressed in most of the parasite life stages [22, 23] . Therefore, epitope-based vaccine features excellent immunogenicity and is valuable for acquiring new immunization strategy [22, 24] . This review summarizes the approaches in developing vaccines against toxoplasmosis with emphasis on epitope-based vaccine and describes the designing and construction strategies of such vaccines, the advantages, disadvantages, and the current applications of these types of vaccines in toxoplasmosis vaccination strategies.
The development of protective vaccines against T. gondii parasite can reduce the high incidence of the disease and prevent the clinical outcome in humans and animals [24, 25] . Therefore, effective immunization is expected to reduce the shedding of the oocyst and prevent the cyst formation. Such vaccination would significantly reduce parasite transmission to intermediate hosts and definitely improve disease control [24] . Economically, the vaccine could also reduce losses in the livestock industry [26] . Thus, achieving effective vaccines against toxoplasmosis is a high priority and extremely important, given the high incidence of the disease worldwide, as well as the serious veterinary and clinical outcomes of the parasite, including chorioretinitis, abortions, mental defects, and death [26, 27] .
During the last 20 years, different immunization strategies in the achievement of effective T. gondii vaccine have been investigated. Consequently, the protection level has been evaluated with different types of immunogens, including the following: life-attenuated parasites, killed vaccines, native parasite antigens, recombinant antigens, and DNA vaccine; these immunogens have been tested as a new immunization strategy [22] [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, inoculation of live parasites significantly induces effective immune protection against toxoplasmosis reinfection [28] .
Despite the significant efforts in developing T. gondii vaccine, only the live attenuated tachyzoites of strain S48 (commercially named ""Toxovax"") was approved and licensed in 1992 to minimize the abortion rate in sheep. Unfortunately, this vaccine cannot be used for human immunization because of the risk of reverting to a virulent form; likewise, the vaccine may be pathogenic in immunocompromised patients [24] . Toxovax has a short shelf life and entails high costs [22] . In addition, immunization with other strains (ts-4) has been widely used in T. gondii immunization studies, providing significant resistance against cyst formation but partial protection against congenital toxoplasmosis. This approach increased the survival rate during acute toxoplasmosis [29] . Mouse inoculated with the temperature-sensitive mutant strain ts-4 induced protective immunity against lethal infection after a parasite challenge. By contrast, injection of mice with killed tachyzoite lysate provided no protection, neither alone nor with an adjuvant [21] . Despite the numerous vaccination strategies studied, as well as the vast knowledge of the molecular genetics, immunology, and pathology related to the T. gondii pathogen, no safe and protective vaccine exists for both humans and animals [22] .
Thus far, all information obtained from the large number of immunization attempts have indicated that future T. gondii vaccination approaches should use antigens with the potential to stimulate cell-mediated immunity against the parasite, expressed in all parasite life stages and compatible with appropriate vaccination routes [22, 23] .
The key step in controlling T. gondii infection is the prevention of oocyst formation in the definitive host (cats and other felines). Given that cats are the only source of oocysts, and that most probably, transmission of infection to intermediate hosts occurs through contaminated feces, the development of any protective vaccines to be used in this species must be able to limit the shedding of oocyst to prevent environmental contamination by the oocysts [30] . Only, few studies have, thus, far focused on the cat vaccination. The use of a live mutant bradyzoite named T-263 was the first trial in which kittens were vaccinated [31] . After the oral inoculation, most of the kittens generated protective immunity; oocyst shedding was successfully prevented in 84% of the cats when challenged with the T. gondii parasite [31, 32] . Unfortunately, T-263 has many disadvantages, including the need to use live bradyzoites and high costs [33] . Similarly, the effect of 60 Co-irradiated tachyzoites on the stimulation of protective immunity against the Beverley strains of T. gondii was investigated. The vaccine induced partial resistance after infection challenge; however, the vaccine showed disadvantages, such as the need for refrigeration and high costs [34] . Oocyst shedding was not reduced when DNA vaccines encoding rhoptry protein (ROP) 2 were used [35] even though DNA vaccine currently shows potential as an immunization tool.
In pigs, live T. gondii vaccines exhibited mild protection against the parasite but still showed risks of reverting to the virulent type and cause the disease [36] . Thus, in this species, the development of killed vaccines was necessary [22] . Recently, intradermal immunization of pigs with a DNA vaccine expressing GRA1-GRA7 of Toxoplasma antigens elicited high humoral and cellular immunity. The study proved that DNA vaccine could be effectively induce strong immune protection [37] . In addition, the potential of the tachyzoites of strain S48 in reducing the number of cysts in pork, and thus, improving food safety has been highlighted [38] .
Among the various approaches for acquiring effective T. gondii vaccines, the recombinant DNA technology is an alternative strategy of great potential [25, 39] . The immunological effects of several Toxoplasma recombinant antigens have been widely evaluated in the last few years; these include surface antigens (SAGs), micronemal proteins, dense-granule proteins (GRAs), and ROPs [9, 35, 40, 41] . Of them, only limited antigens were capable of inducing a strong and protective immunity. Unluckily, recombinant antigens tend to lack immunogenicity, especially vaccination trails of the intracellular pathogens. Therefore, uses of appropriate adjuvants are required to enhance their potency [42] . In addition, the production of the recombinant proteins within another expression system or organism could cause an allergic reaction [43] .
The establishments of DNA vaccination strategies have opened a new perspective in the future of vaccine development [34, 44] . Recently, various DNA vaccines against T. gondii have been developed and evaluated; some of them have shown promise [45] . The ability of such vaccines to induce high humoral and cell-mediated immunity makes it a promising vaccination strategy against intracellular pathogens including Toxoplasma [15] . DNA vaccines exhibit several advantageous such as easy to produce, easy to administer, stable, very immunogenic, and possess the potential for long-lasting immunity. In addition, DNA vaccines show high flexibility as several types of genes can be encoded in one DNA vaccine. Moreover, DNA vaccine has little risk of reverting to a virulent form or cause secondary infection [46] .
Antigenic variation and genetic polymorphisms represent major obstacles in the attempts of acquiring a successful vaccine of any particular pathogen. Therefore, understanding of these variation and polymorphisms in the populations is crucial for proper vaccine design and evaluation. Such data might also provide invaluable insights into parasite-host interaction [21, 47] . The improved knowledge in bioinformatics tools, along with the advances in recombinant DNA technology, has allowed new strategies toward the design and production of novel epitope-based vaccines [48] . Epitopes or antigenic determinants are the minimal immunogenic part of any particular antigen, which are capable of inducing specific immune responses [49] . Accordingly, various immunogenic epitopes have been identified in different infectious pathogens and cancer, and they have significantly improved the development of potential epitope-based vaccines [50] .
The improved understanding of how the immune cells recognize and interact with pathogenic antigens at the molecular and cellular level has significant contribution in the development and acquiring of rationally designed epitope vaccines [7] . The concept of epitope vaccines mainly relies on the prediction of immunodominant T and B cell epitopes that can elicit specific and protective immune response [51] . The antigenic variation in most infectious agents has impeded the development of effective vaccines [17] . Therefore, the use of immunogenic peptides in trials of acquiring epitope-based vaccine has recently drawn attention [51] .
The most critical requirements include the proper identification of both T and B cells epitopes, as well as the selection of a novel and powerful approach to deliver those epitopes [48] . Immunization with multi-epitope vaccine expressing T-cell or/and B-cell epitopes against different pathogens showed significant increase in both cellular and humoral immunes responses, as well as prolonged survival time [30] . Numerous studies identified potential epitope-based antigens that could effectively induce high and protective immunity against diverse pathogens. The approach has been used to develop and evaluate vaccines to various infectious agents, such as Influenza Virus [52] , Human Immunodeficiency Virus [53] , Epstein-Barr Virus [19] , and hepatitis B virus [54] .
The potential advantages of using this vaccination strategy are as follows: it decreases the biohazard risk associated with other types of immunization; it has the ability to rationally engineer and optimize the epitope structure to increase potency in eliciting strong immunity; and it provides the opportunity to focus and generate specific immune responses to known conserved immunodominant epitopes [55] . In addition to the lack of infectious potential, epitope-based vaccine also shows chemical stability, and therefore, such kind of vaccines have been developed and tested against various infectious agents, including parasitic, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, as well as cancers [51, 56] . In the clinical trials of various cancers, peptide vaccine has entered phases I and II with satisfactory and promising clinical outcomes [57] . However, more effort is needed to eliminate the associated obstacles, including the necessity to have a better adjuvant, as well as the low or/and lack of resulting immunogenicity during antigen processing and presentation. Nonetheless, other study showed a significant progress in defying these limitations [51] .
Development of any potential epitope vaccine requires proper prediction and validation of highly immunogenic epitopes that are capable of inducing protective immune response and constitutes the basis of vaccines development as shown in Figure 1 [58] . In fact, significant barrier in designing such kind of vaccine is epitope identification [59] . Therefore, predicting or identifying T and B cell epitopes significantly furthered our understanding of how the immune response against the pathogens is generated and increased the chances of developing potential vaccines. The mechanism of action and how the epitope-based vaccines generate specific immune response were illustrated in Figure 2 . Bioinformatic tools remain the vital option for analyzing immunogenic epitopes with high antigenicity and immunogenicity even though the inherent complexity of microbial antigens recognition complicates the process of epitope prediction [21, 60] . Yet, significant efforts have been put toward acquiring novel strategies and efficient tools for epitope analysis. Consequently, different algorithms have been developed and tested for predicting and screening of possible epitopes, and the results indicate a promising strategy for vaccine development [59] . Application of bioinformatics approaches in the analysis of conserved sequences and predicting of potential epitopes have been widely used against various pathogens. It represents a powerful alternative strategy of epitopes discovery that significantly reduces the cost, time, as well as the effort involved in the experimental approach of epitope screening. However, the variation among epitopic regions might affect the prediction process, and thus acquiring functional protective epitopes. Selection of immunogenic epitopes is crucial in designating any particular epitope-based vaccine; therefore, the differences in pathogens genotypes and subtypes should be taken into account.
Since the application of bioinformatics tools in the production of epitope-based antigen has become potential strategies to acquire a novel and powerful vaccine against infectious agents [61] , considerable efforts have been made toward developing a promising epitope-based vaccine against toxoplasmosis (Table 1) [62, 63] . Researcher assumes that construction of single-or multi-epitope-based antigen expressing potential B or/and T cell epitopes of both tachyzoite and bradyzoite specific antigens would greatly improve T. gondii immunization strategies [64] . Accordingly, several studies have been conducted and resulted in the identification of various promising epitopes that are capable of inducing protective immune response, and would possibly contribute to the attempts of developing a protective vaccine against T. gondii [7] . This evidenced by the significant immune protection generated in mice models [65, 66] .
Recently, a synthetic vaccine expressing nine epitopes predicted from GRA2, GRA7, and SAG1 of T. gondii was tested in BALB/c mice. Immunization with this multi-epitope vaccine significantly generates mixed Th1/Th2 antibody response and high production of IFN-γ cytokine [67] . Similarly, significant increase in the cellular and humoral immunity was generated when the mice was immunized with a multi-epitope vaccine containing two T cell epitopes and one B cell epitope of SAG1, GRA1, and GRA4. In addition, vaccinated mice obtained long-term survival rates compared with the unvaccinated controls [12] .
In contrast, epitope vaccine composed of a single B or T cell epitopes has been used previously and confirmed to elicit strong immune responses, for instance, synthetic B and T cell epitopes identified from GRA2 antigen were able to stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity and to increase the survival rate of immunized animals [64] . Similarly, mice immunized with epitopes vaccine identified form ROP19 protein induced significant T and B cell immune response and also indicated effective protection following parasite challenge with PRU strain T. gondii cysts [68] . However, effective systemic and mucosal immunity was enhanced with both single and mixed peptides with a strong lymphoproliferative response associated with significant IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-4 production, and a high level of specific antibody responses. In addition, partial immune protection against acute and chronic toxoplasmosis was also generated [7] . Furthermore, a combination of DNA/ peptide vaccine significantly reduced the formation of the brain cyst among the immunized mice [69] .
This emphasized the involvement of single or mixture of epitopes has shown to remarkably induce effective humoral and cellular immune response against toxoplasmosis. This could be powerful and efficient strategy that can be considered in the production of possibly protective vaccine candidate against toxoplasmosis.
The development of potential vaccine against T. gondii has significantly progressed in the last few years. Numerous experimental studies of preventive immunization have explored various forms of T. gondii antigens including live-attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, recombinant vaccine, and DNA vaccines [13] . Accordingly, significant strides have been conducted in antigen isolation and characterization, gene cloning, and immunological techniques. In addition to all the prevention strategies, new options to produce effective vaccines are currently needed as the appropriate way to prevent the disease [15] .
Previous studies on developing effective vaccines against T. gondii revealed that vaccines that express only single antigen or single stage induce partial immune protection against the parasite [64] . Thus, a vaccine that expresses multiple stages of the parasite life cycle must be synthesized. Adopting bioinformatics to identify antigenic epitopes and theoretically arranging multiple epitopes in a single antigen could aid in the achievement of potential T. gondii vaccines. The use of epitope-based antigens is highly promising in the development of potential vaccine candidates that would generate lasting protective immune reaction against T. gondii. Furthermore, the use of epitope-based antigens could be an important approach in investigating the improvement of the disease vaccination in the future. Future studies should also consider the exploration of Table 1 . List of predicted Epitopes evaluated as potential Epitope-based vaccine.

105,f90706bbb06cb2fa2992200bddfa2a3305f52b67,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viral frequency, seasonality, and clinical and demographic features of patients hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. A cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed in 316 infants younger than 2 years of age who were hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis. Respiratory tract infection agents were investigated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 316 infants were included in this study. Of the 316 infants, at least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected in 75% (237/316). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus identified in 127 infants (40.1%) followed by rhinovirus (n = 78, 24.6%). In this study, where viral agents were determined via PCR in patients who were followed-up due to the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis, RSV was detected as the most common agent, as in other studies. In almost half of the RSV-positive patients, RSV was accompanied by a second or third agent.","Acute bronchiolitis (AB), which is the most common acute lower respiratory system disease in infants, is often caused by a viral infection. It is especially the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 6 months of age. 1, 2 Epidemic peaks of AB are frequently seen during the winter season. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is usually the cause of 50% to 80% of the cases, but other viruses including adenovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus have also been reported to cause AB as the sole pathogen or as coinfection with or without RSV. 3, 4 With various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, possible new agents like rhinovirus, human metapnomovirus, human bocavirus, Bordatella pertussis, and atypical pathogens were also described as the leading causes of AB. [5] [6] [7] Having a cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, immunodeficiency, and premature birth increase the risk of AB-associated respiratory failure, or even death. 8 The World Health Organization has reported that RSV is the causative pathogen for over 30 million new acute lower respiratory infection episodes in children under 5 years of age and it gives rise to more than 3.4 million hospital admissions and 160 000 deaths every year. 9, 10 The diagnosis of AB is made based on typical history with wheezing and characteristic clinical features such as tachypnea, nasal flaring, chest retractions, and wheezing and/or rales followed by a viral upper respiratory infection in infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2006 11 Chest radiographs and laboratory studies may be thought of on clinical suspicion after evaluating the differential diagnosis for secondary or comorbid bacterial infection, complications, or other conditions. Viral diagnosis methods including antigen detection or immunofluorescence of nasal secretion wash or nasal aspiration, rapid antigen tests, and PCR are only suggested for identifying specific viral agents in children with bronchiolitis if the results will determine discontinuation of palivizumab prophylaxis, initiation or continuation/discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. [12] [13] [14] [15] Majority of studies have recently researched the burden of respiratory viral tract infection agents in AB with larger groups. In these studies, epidemiological, clinical, and risk factors of AB have also been defined. So, it can be said that AB is frequent in infancy and that there is an increase in the number of admissions to hospitals and bronchiolitis-related morbidity.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of pathogens and to determine the differences in clinical and microbiological features among patients under 24 months of age, who were hospitalized with AB in Ege University Children's Hospital.
Ege University Children's Hospital, a tertiary care pediatric teaching hospital, is a 200-bed hospital located in heavily populated area of Izmir. It serves nearly 10 000 inpatients per year that are mostly from middle to low socioeconomic status. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Ege University Children's Hospital and was conducted during a 3-year period. A prospective cross-sectional study of children younger than 24 months who were hospitalized with AB was conducted between October 2013 and October 2016 at the General Pediatrics ward of Children's Hospital. The ethics committee of Ege University approved the study.
Infants who were hospitalized with AB were recruited with informed, written, parental consent. According to the recommendations of AAP guidelines, the diagnosis of AB was based on at least 2 of the following signs: chest retractions, tachypnea, and wheezing or rales on auscultation following viral upper respiratory tract infection in children less than 24 months of age for the first time. 11 Excluded were infants who hospitalized within 2 weeks before the current admission, those who developed nosocomial AB, or those who had a known history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease or any immunodeficiency. Infants who were born prematurely were also excluded from the study. Detailed demographic data including age, gender, smoke exposure, and epidemiological data were collected with a structured questionnaire and from medical files of all patients on admission.
On hospital admission, clinical parameters and severity of the disease including wheezing, retraction, respiratory rate, and general situation were evaluated and assessed with Wang respiratory score. 16 Each parameter was given points from 0 to 3 and then the child's points were added up to describe the severity of AB; points between 0 and 3 showed mild bronchiolitis, between 4 and 8 moderate, and points between 9 and 12 indicated severe bronchiolitis. Complete blood count (white blood cell count and percentage of lymphocytes) and C-reactive protein were measured at admission.
A nasal smear was obtained from each infant and tested for the presence of RSV, influenza virus types A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and human bocavirus with multiplex reverse-transcription PCR methods (RealAccurate, Respiratory RT PCR, PathoFinder, Netherlands, and Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection, Seegene, South Korea). Nasal samples were obtained more commonly by a nurse or sometimes a research assistant on all subjects within 48 hours of admission using a standardized protocol. 17 Samples were frozen at −20°C and transported on ice to the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Virology Laboratory of our university for viral nucleic acid amplification.
Data analyses were performed using SPSS version 21.0. The quantitative data including percentage, mean, and standard deviations were calculated by simple descriptive analyses. Means ± SD were used to summarize the demographic data and the baseline characteristics of the cases. All analyses were conducted using SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
Between April 2013 and April 2016, a total of 316 infants hospitalized with AB were included in this prospective study. The mean age was 7 ± 6.5 months; 201 (63.6%) were male ( Table 1 ). The most frequent age range of infants with AB was 1 to 6 months, accounting for 63.6% of all included cases. Most of the patients had cough and runny nose on admission to hospital. Nearly half of the infants diagnosed with AB were exposed to passive smoking. There was a history of atopy in 12% of all the infants. Table 2 shows the clinical data and laboratory findings, disease severity scores, hospitalization rates, and duration of hospitalizations of the infants. The most common complaint of the patients was cough (100%), and fever was present only in 88 (27.8%) of all the cases on admission to hospital. On examination, the percentage of infants with wheezing was 58. Ninety-six (30.4%) infants needed oxygen supplementation, and the mean length of hospitalization duration was 7.5 days. More than half of the infants had moderate bronchiolitis and the mean respiratory score was 5.3.
Acute bronchiolitis was diagnosed in 316 infants younger than 24 months of age. Overall, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 75% (237/316) of the cases at Ege University Children's Hospital. The results of the incidence of respiratory viruses in infants hospitalized with AB during the study period are shown in Table 3 . RSV was identified in 127 (40.1%) of the 316 infants hospitalized for AB, and RSV was the most common agent. Of the 127 RSV-positive infants, 76 (59.8%) were sole pathogen for RSV and 51 infants had RSV-coinfection, which was responsible for respiratory tract infection. The second prevalent viral agent was rhinovirus, identified in 78 (24.6%) of the subjects, and as a single pathogen in 35 1%) , and quadruple infections in 1/316 (0.3%) were detected. Of the 81 infants with multiple agents, RSV (51 cases) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (n = 43, 53%), influenza virus (n = 18, 22.2%), human metapneumovirus (n = 16, 19.7%), PIV (n = 10, 12.3%), adenovirus (n = 16, 19.7%), human bocavirus (n = 13, 16%), parainfluenza virus (n = 10, 12.3%), and human coronavirus (n = 8, 9.8%). Among dual co-infections, the combination of RSV and rhinovirus had the the highest number (n = 15, 22.3%). The age distribution of infants is shown in Figure 1 for RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and dual infections. In particular, most viral agents were identified in children of all months, whereas RSV was detected in infants aged under 6 months (n = 93/127, 73.2%) and in 15.7% (n = 20/127) of the 127 RSV-positive infants aged under 1 year of age, which was the case in most of our patients. The monthly incidence of bronchiolitis in infants due to common respiratory pathogens is shown in Figure 2 . The majority of the cases were admitted to hospital in the winter time with a peak occurring in January, February, and March; detection rates were also high during these months (26.2%, 25.3%, and 17%, respectively). Other respiratory virus epidemics were seen also during the winter season ( Figure 3 ). Fifteen cases infected with parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus were seen in the summer time.
The current study of the infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis has proved once again that AB is an important cause of hospitalization in infants, mostly younger than 6 months of age. Using multiplex real-time PCR technique we demonstrated that at least one respiratory viral pathogen was responsible for bronchiolitis in 75% of our cases.
Various studies have shown that RSV is the most common etiologic pathogen with a rate of 50% to 80%. 18 Almost 30% to 40% of cases are related to other viruses including adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, influenza, and rhinovirus. In recent years, new human respiratory viruses like human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and new human coronaviruses have also been reported as possible pathogens causing AB. 19 Today, various viral diagnostic tests allow us to examine the epidemiological differences/ clinical characteristics of respiratory viruses and to provide information on their presence. Multiplex PCR has been the most commonly used method due to some significant advantages like permitting simultaneous amplification of several viruses in a single reaction and facilitating cost-effective diagnosis. 20 In this study, we evaluated via multiplex PCR technique the variety and burden of viral agents causing AB in infants under 24 months of age.
The findings are in agreement with the results of several studies previously reported, in which RSV was diagnosed in 50% to 80% of infants admitted to hospital with acute bronchiolitis. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] RSV was the most common virus identified in 127 infants (40.1%) in our study. Stempel et al 26 showed that RSV incidence was 77%, and Antunes et al 27 found this as 58.1% in the RSV epidemic season. In our study, RSV was the most frequently identified respiratory virus, accounting for 40.1% of all respiratory viruses. In addition, 24.6% of the infants in our study were positive for rhinovirus, followed by influenza virus (8.8%), human metapneumovirus (8.5%), adenovirus (7.2%), human bocavirus (6.3%), parainfluenza virus (5.6%), and human coronavirus (3.1%). Human rhinoviruses are the most common human respiratory pathogens and are responsible for most upper respiratory infections (eg, common cold). They may also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. 28 Additionally, human rhinoviruses are known as a major pathogen for asthma exacerbations in children and adults. Recently, some studies have shown rhinoviruses to be the second most commonly seen pathogen for AB. A study conducted in the United States found a prevalence of 25.6% for rhinovirus, 25 similar to our study. However, other studies reported a lower incidence rate of human rhinoviruses in acute bronchiolitis. 24, 29, 30 Our study showed that the respiratory viral agents exhibited seasonal patterns with the number of RSV and rhinovirus cases peaking in the winter season similar to that already published in previous studies. 31 It has been reported that the seasonal distribution of respiratory agents may occur due to meteorological conditions, spreading of infectious pathogens, and pathogen transmission by the host behavior due to different meteorological conditions. 32, 33 Another important theory on pathogen activity is total sunshine exposure. It is hypothesized that ultraviolet light radiation could affect the spread of RSV by inactivating it. 33, 34 The city of Izmir in Turkey, located in the west, has Mediterranean climate in which summers are hot and dry and winters are warm and rainy. This climatic feature could explain the seasonal pattern of respiratory viruses in our study.
In keeping with previous studies, we found that the respiratory viruses could occur as co-infection with other respiratory viruses, within a range of 19% to 35% dual, triple, or more, dual being the most frequent. 26, 35 Ong et al 36 showed in their study that RSV bronchiolitis associated with other pathogens was present in 10% of the infants. In a multicenter study, it was reported that the co-infection rate was 9%. 25 A study by Papadopoulos et al 37 stated that 19.5% of 119 infants were dual-infected, 69% of whom had RSV together with rhinovirus. In this study, we identified co-infection in 81 (25.6%) infants with bronchiolitis, (20) and more than half of 25.6% showed the same dual combination.
In the 1960s, it was reported that the mortality in infants less than 1 year of age diagnosed with bronchiolitis was 4% to 7% for those who were born prematurely and who had an underlying cardiopulmonary disease or immunodeficiency. 11 Today, the mortality rate of AB is low due to the fact that the infants are monitored by some preventive measures such as palivizumab and improved health services. However, there is an increase in the number of infants applying to hospital and hospitalization. Hall et al 38 reported that the yearly incidence of hospitalization due to RSV bronchiolitis for infants aged under 6 months was 17, emergency department visits were 55, and office visits were 132 per 1000 children. Our study has a number of limitations. First, we only investigated the hospitalized patients with acute bronchiolitis, and not the infants who applied to the emergency services or outpatients policlinics, so our study group was small in number. Second, we did not identify other possible agents such as atypical or bacterial pathogens that could cause acute bronchiolitis. Third, a 3-year study period was not adequate compared to other long-term studies.
Our study showed that the causative agents of acute bronchiolitis are quite varied in inpatient infants in Ege University Children's Hospital during a period of 3 years. Molecular diagnostic techniques uncovered a high frequency of viruses and viral combination infections among patients hospitalized with AB. RSV remains the most frequent causative pathogen, followed by rhinovirus. Even if the results of diagnostic methods for RSV show that the most common pathogen is single, multiple viral infections should also be considered for AB. The present study also emphasized the potential significance of other viruses such as influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, human bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and human coronavirus in infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis, as sole or co-pathogen.

Methods: The study uses a mixed method approach. Initially, through a qualitative study, 12 experts were interviewed deeply; then, 22 participants in three equal focus groups expressed their ideas about growth and development of MT in Iran. Based on the expressed ideas, 120 factors were identified and accordingly a structured questionnaire was developed. Some members from the focus groups confirmed the questionnaire's face and content validity. The reliability of pertinent items was confirmed using Cronbach's alpha=0.8. Afterwards, 61 eligible subjects filled out this questionnaire.
Results: The findings showed that ""healthcare quality"" and ""high level of expertise"" are two most attractive factors in MT. However, other factors such as ""healthcare costs"", and ""visa facilities"" are among key factors as well. Also, the role of ""the healthcare providers"" was found to be more prominent than the roles of ""the government"" and ""the general tourist services"".
Conclusion: Although some attractive MT factors are present currently, MT expansion to a desirable level in Iran requires a comprehensive plan of which its factors were discussed in this paper.","Medical tourism (MT) is defined as travel of people especially to other countries with the aim of seeking treatment. MT is considered as professional health activities that entails trade in medical services and represents splicing of at least two sectors: medicine and tourism. Although MT is considered as a modern field, it dates back to ancient times (1) when people were used to travel to special destinations seeking a variety of medical services.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), MT is a growing trend with enormous economic implications (2) . Therefore, in recent years, many countries are developing comprehensive plans to use this opportunity to improve their economy as well as the quality of medical care.
It was not until 2003 that Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) paid attention to MT systematically for the first time, and in 2004 MT was considered as a separate health industry (3) . However, the very ambitious MT plan, which was supposed to meet at least 30% of national medical financial needs until 2010 through providing medical services to foreigners, did not come up with expectations. It is believed that lacking of a comprehensive plan, and insufficient attention in implementation phase were the main reasons of such a failure (4, 5) . This necessitates identification of the factors affected the expansion of MT in Iran. MT is divided into two main components: therapeutic and surgical. Although MT and ""health tourism"" are usually used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference in between. Kusen regarded ""health tour-ism"" as series of newly emerged preventive and curative services, some of them including: cosmetic services, aromatherapy, Cleopatra's bath, Reiki, Shiatsu, Yoga, aesthetic treatments, and anti-cellulite programs and many other types of alternative medicine (6) . From a different prospective, health tourism covers a range of services tailored for rather healthy subjects to empower them to live safer and longer (7) (8) (9) (10) .
Connell (7) believes that MT is a growing industry with a prosperous future. There are some reasons supporting this prediction such as long waiting lists in many industrial countries, high rate failure of medical procedures in some countries, the high cost of medical services in developed countries, the developing countries' considerable progress in medicine, facilitated traveling, and more or less uniform medical procedures standards.
Some motivations of healthcare seekers toward MT include: economic motivations, i.e. seeking low cost services, to receive services timely with short/no waiting list, for receiving advanced and achievable cosmetic procedures, and for high quality services. Therefore, it seems that there is room for expanding MT in Iran and when it comes to social, cultural, economic, and even political reasons, such an expansion seems inevitable.
In spite of many attractive opportunities in Iran for MT such as the acceptable level and quality of medical treatments especially organ transplantation, cell therapy, infertility and cosmetic procedures, many wellequipped hospitals and medical centers at reasonable costs which their number is increased considerably in recent years (11), there are some accommodation management and legislative issues that must be addressed precisely. For example, subjects may satisfy with receiving appropriate, on time, and beneficial services, but may claim for good accommodation before, during or after receiving treatment. In addition, the friendly environment of the community and the respect of people to legislation are very important as well (4, 5) .
On top of the above mentioned advantages for attracting medical tourists is the geopolitical location of Iran. Iran is a big and historical country (more than 1.6 million square kilometers area) with different climates and many fascinating places and ancient sites. Moreover, the health system of Iran is stronger than of many Middle Eastern countries. Respect to religious rituals in medicine and also an Islamic dominant community are another advantages which may be favorable for Muslim treatment seekers in the region and Islamic world (12) .
This paper explores the underlying reasons why Iran with these unique advantages has not been successful enough in MT field in recent years. Answer to this question is very important to help the system to develop a comprehensive plan accordingly. In this regard, undoubtedly, collecting experiences and suggestions of Iranian MT experts may help revitalizing MT in Iran.
Using a mixed methods design, the study starts with a qualitative approach followed by a quantitative questionnaire-based survey. The main goal of this study was to explore main barriers against the expansion of MT in recent years in Iran.
In both parts, subjects were selected from professionals in different ministries and organizations including: the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, Iran Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Mine, Industry and Commerce, some medical universities, and some public, semi-public and private hospitals and medical centers.
In the qualitative part data were collected using two methods:
1. In-depth interviews: semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 unique participants from three ministries/organizations ( Table 1 ). The interview transcripts were analyzed using the 'framework' analysis approach. This involved a five-step process:
I. Familiarization; II. Identifying a thematic Framework; III. Indexing; IV. Charting; and V. Mapping and Interpretation. 2. Focus Groups: three focus groups were arranged with 22 unique participants from seven ministries/organizations (Table 1) . In this section, data analysis consisted of examining, categorizing, and recombining the ideas to address the main objectives of this study.
In parallel to the above mentioned parts, all available documents and reports of the MOHE were reviewed and relevant concepts were extracted.
Afterwards, the qualitative findings were analyzed and accordingly and on the basis of extracted concepts from review of the MOHME documents a structured questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire face and content validity was confirmed by a group of scholars from the focus group participants and the questionnaire reliability was tested using a Cronbach's alpha which was calculated 0.8. A purposive sampling method was used to select 61 eligible participants from aforementioned seven ministries/organizations (Table 1 ). All questionnaires were returned in due time. The study was carried out from July-September 2015.
The questionnaires' items were described using appropriate tables and graphs. The average score of each item was calculated in a scale between 0 and 10.
At the end, the findings of qualitative and quantitative parts and extracted themes from the literature review were combined and summarized in simple descriptive tables.
Hopefully, the participation rate was very high, and all those who were approached contributed effectively mainly because of their special attention to this topic.
After extracting all necessary issues from our interviews and focus groups, three main stakeholders and their roles recognized as follows:
1. Government, ministries and related organizations: to coordinate all activities, issue supportive rules and regulations, and monitoring the roles of all role-players 2. Healthcare and medical service providers: paying attention to health services' quality, evidence-based services, accessibility and cost of services and to satisfy health seekers 3. Tourism Services: attention to nonmedical supports such as accommodation, travelling, cost of extra-services, availability of information and creating calm and peaceful environment.
Based on the scores in the qualitative part of the study, the most important stockholder was service providers (score: 7.1) followed by government (5.52), and tourism services (4.18) (Fig. 1) . 
It was suggested that a good governance is necessary to facilitate all actives. It was expected that the government and all of its departments pass appropriate rules facilitating regulations (6.61), allocate required resources (6.6), and develop necessary infrastructures (3.08). Also, the supervision of all provided cares and treatments from the quality and cost prospective was pointed out (7.6).
The most important roles of this group was to guarantee the quality of cares from different point of views; manpower (9.1), facilities and hospitals (7.5) , and other components (6.1). Moreover, they have to facilitate the access to the best services timely (6.14), minimize costs (5.1), and provide modern technology (7.8).
It was mentioned that the quality and accessibility of appropriate transportation (6.7), accommodation (5.5), and communications (3.1) are important for health tourisms. Also, the cost of these services (4.3), and facilities for receiving visa (4.7), and providing information about the attractive locations (4.8) were pointed out. Figure 2 shows the scores of main responsibilities of different stakeholders. Based on these scores, it seems that particularly health service providers' roles are very http://mjiri.iums.ac.ir important to provide high technology cares with reasonable cost and high quality.
This research was conducted to answer the question of the influence of governmental laws on the expansion of MT industry, and the impact of managerial performance. Overall, the results showed that the role of healthcare providers is more prominent. In other words, the government has to pave the road by implementing supportive rules and regulations, tourism organization has to create attractive environment by providing appropriate services, and medical centers have to provide high quality cares with reasonable costs.
The attraction of Iran for MT is somehow unique. The quality of medical services is acceptable, the privet sector is active alongside of public sector and the cost of medical cares and surgeries are relatively low. On top of that, the historical, cultural, and ecological attractions of Iran for foreigners are well-recognized. The Islamic government of Iran might be another positive score to attract patients from the Middle Eastern countries.
Generally, during the research it was revealed that all approached policymakers and experts in different sectors were aware of the importance of MT industry, and had enough interest to work together to expand MT in Iran and discuss about why MT is not expanded, as it was planned, in recent years in Iran? And what are the barriers and how we can tackle the issues?
To answer these questions, we consulted some high ranked experts around the country within the scope of MT.
Our findings showed that the role of healthcare providers especially in privet sector is very important (13). Thus, role players in private section have to spend more time to the quality of cares and advertise their services internationally mentioning their reasonable costs for high technology quality services for international cus-tomers.
In this way, the support of the government and all of its departments are vital. The experiences of other countries show that the government has to implement supportive regulations and motivate and coordinate all related organizations to work together efficiently. It seems that this role is more important in a country like Iran with a dominant public health sector and existed bureaucracy.
Doubtlessly, tourist industry has significant role in expansion of MT as well. The required infrastructure for all types of tourism is somehow the same (14) . Our findings highlighted the importance of accommodation, travelling, availability of information and facilities in obtaining visa. Therefore, as part of the plan for improving MT, the tourism organization has to be considered as a very important role player. MT is a competitive industry other countries undoubtedly have plans to expand their services efficiently. Therefore, every country is monitoring the current activities by other competitors to make sure that they are traveling in right direction and their approaching speed is acceptable.
The result of current research is mainly based on the finding of a qualitative study and thus generalizability of its findings might be point of concern. However, since the conclusion is based on a deep and systematic exploration of this issue compatible with the expression of experts from various sectors in different positions, it seems that the findings are relatively robust to be used as valid evidence.
Our findings showed that MT is a very attractive industry for main health roleplayers in Iran. It seems that a comprehensive plan is needed to coordinate all main stockholders including governmental organizations, healthcare providers and tourism organization. High quality of care with reasonable costs and appropriate tourism facilities are very important factors which",Effective factors in expansion of medical tourism in Iran,"Rezaee, Reza; Mohammadzadeh, Mehdi",Med J Islam Repub Iran,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5038994/,198,1966,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,d311964341e7e167635e150212eee7d7a70130e8,"Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a histological change in lung tissue, and is generally caused by an acute lung injury, which is characterized by bilateral and widespread damages. Localized DAD occurs very rarely. The causes for DAD are numerous, but the chief cause is acute interstitial pneumonia or acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, in cases of idiopathic manifestation. The 82-year-old patient, in this case study, showed a DAD lesion in only 1 lobe. The patient was otherwise healthy, with no previous symptoms of DAD. He was admitted to our medical center owing to localized infiltration, observed on his chest radiograph. Laboratory studies showed no signs of infections. DAD was confirmed by a surgical lung biopsy. The patient received corticosteroid treatment and had gradually improved. We report the case of a patient with localized, idiopathic DAD that cannot be classified as acute interstitial pneumonia or acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.","Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a typical pathological finding in cases of acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). However, DAD is caused by various such as infection, transplantation surgery, medication, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that develops after radiation treatment, acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (AEIIP), acute exacerbation of allergic alveolitis, and viral lung infections (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 influenza A) 1, 2 . From a clinical aspect, AIP and AEIIP are most commonly diagnosed, but the etiology of these disease remains unclear.
DAD typically shows a bilateral diffuse infiltration pattern in the lung. Thus, a localized lesion in the lung is considered as a rare event, and Yazdy et al. 3 reported that the localized incidence of DAD is 1.2% 4 . We report asymptomatic, localized, and idiopathic DAD, which does not comply with the diagnostic criteria of AIP and AEIIP.
An 82-year-old man was admitted to our medical center because of nausea and vomiting that occurred after the first oral anti-tuberculosis medication. One week before the admission, the patient underwent a routine-biannual health check-up at a local healthcare facility, and his chest radiograph showed consolidation in the left upper lobe (LUL). The patient received immediate medical attention owing suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had been receiving routine-biannual health check-ups, and did not have any major disease, except hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He had no history of smoking and drinking. He had been under clinidipin and sitagliptin treatments for 5 years for hypertension and diabetes, respectively. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate was 70 beats/min, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and body temperature was 36.5 o C. The findings of auscultation were insignificant. Signs of collagen vascular disease were not observed, and the remaining physical examination was unremarkable. His chest radiograph showed an increase in consolidation in the LUL as compared with the observation a week ago. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a diffuse, patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in the LUL. Reticular opacities, on which our suspicion of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was based, were found along the periphery of both the lower lobes ( Figure 1 ). No bronchiectasis or honeycombing was observed.
Laboratory findings were as follows: leukocyte count was 8,700/μL, C-reactive protein level was 103 mg/dL, and anti-nuclear antibody was not detected. Arterial blood gas analysis was not performed because the patient did not have dyspnea. The other data were within normal limits. Upon admission, 750-mg of levofloxacin was administered to the patient for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Blood and sputum cultures were negative. The results of the serologic tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were also negative. On day 4 after admission, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed because the lesion in the LUL had not improved. Cellular components and lymphocyte subsets were not assessed for the BAL specimen. Culture, tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction, and cytology of the BAL specimen were negative. Video-assisted thoracoscopy was performed owing to increased infiltration observed on the chest radiograph obtained on day 10. Pathological examination of the tissue samples obtained from the anterior and posterior segment of the LUL showed that DAD was at its organizing stage ( Figure 2 ). We immediately started treatment with high doses of parenteral methylprednisolone, and found that the consolidation of LUL decreased within 3 days after the initiation of the treatment. Further, antibiotic treatment was discontinued, and the steroid therapy was maintained for 3 weeks. A follow-up examination showed almost complete disappearance of the LUL infiltration, although reticular opacities on both the lower lobes remained ( Figure 3 ).
DAD commonly shows a bilateral, diffused, and rapidly deteriorating clinical pattern. However, in the case of our patient, a localized and slowly progressing pattern of DAD was observed. First, the patient was asymptomatic despite the organizing stage DAD shown in the chest radiographs. Second, a localized lesion was present in the LUL of the patient, an uncommon clinical pattern for which the rather new term ""regional alveolar damage (RAD)"" was coined 3, 4 . Third, the etiology of the DAD in the case of this patient was unclear. AIP and AEIIP were known to be the common causes of idiopathic DAD. However, the clinical and radiological findings of this patient were not suggestive of either of the 2 diseases. AIP normally occurs as ARDS, and the most common type of AEIIP is acute exacerbation idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AEIPF). The diagnostic criteria for AEIPF include: a previous history or diagnosis of IPF, occurrence and/or aggravation of dyspnea for a 30-day period before AEIPF can be diagnosed, newly occurring bilateral ground-glass opacity in the lungs confirmed by high-resolution CT of the chest, absence of pulmonary infection confirmed by BAL, and the absence of pulmonary thromboembolism and causes of acute lung injury 1, 5, 6 . High dose corticosteroid therapy has been a standard therapy for AIP and AEIPF, but its benefits are not clear, and the prognosis of this disease is poor 7 . Our case did not fall within the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AIP because the disease was localized and asymptomatic. We did not perform a biopsy in this case for AEIPF confirmation. However, even if the pathological diagnosis of IPF in the bilateral lower lobes were confirmed, the disease would not meet the diagnostic criteria for AEIPF, because it was localized and asymptomatic. Overall, the patient responded well to the steroid therapy. Fourth, the pulmonary lesion progressed unilaterally before the treatment. Therefore, the possibility of an early stage of AIP or AEIPF was low in this case.
Yazdy et al. 3 reported that RAD generally involves the upper lobes of the lungs and leads to poor prognosis in patients; thus, RAD is not simply an early stage of DAD and implicates additional pathogenetic factors. Therefore, our case should be considered as a case of idiopathic DAD that cannot be classified as either as AIP or AEIIP and one that has been never reported before. Sakamoto et al. 8 reported the case of a patient with AEIPF along with localized idiopathic DAD. The patient had no specific previous history and was admitted because of dyspnea 30 days before his admission. The patient had IPF in the lower left lobe and localized DAD in the LUL. Despite steroid therapy, the patient died because of respiratory failure. Sakamoto et al. 8 reported the case of this patient as a rare case of AEIPF because they were unable to determine the etiologies for the aggravation; however, the overall clinical courses were similar to those of AEIPF. In our case, the patient showed an unclear dyspnea pattern, aggravation of the condition, indicated by radiographs; further, he responded well to the steroid treatment. Considering these factors, this case is more of rare idopathic DAD rather than AEIPF. In recent studies, the overall survival of patients with ARDS and AIP has improved with timely treatment by using lung biopsy 9, 10 . However, the usefulness of lung biopsy in cases of acute pulmonary failure of an unknown etiology has not yet been established. This is mainly because of the possibility of an increase in the perioperative risk by invasive procedures that induce hypoxia in both lungs with diffuse infiltration.
In our study, the expedited lung biopsy helped us to establish a treatment plan for the patient who showed localized infiltration, although the etiology of the disease was not clear.","A Case of Asymptomatic, Localized, and Idiopathic Diffuse Alveolar Damage","Jeon, Young Do; Hong, H.

109,7037460cc980744603573744bf370ee8f49a4ffe,"Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the nucleoside analog GS-441524 for cats suffering from various forms of naturally acquired feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Methods Cats ranged from 3.4-73 months of age (mean 13.6 months); 26 had effusive or dry-to-effusive FIP and five had non-effusive disease. Cats with severe neurological and ocular FIP were not recruited. The group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks and increased when indicated to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h. Results Four of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2-5 days and a fifth cat after 26 days. The 26 remaining cats completed the planned 12 weeks or more of treatment. Eighteen of these 26 cats remain healthy at the time of publication (OnlineFirst, February 2019) after one round of treatment, while eight others suffered disease relapses within 3-84 days. Six of the relapses were non-neurological and two neurological. Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage, while five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg q24h. The five cats treated a second time at the higher dosage, including one with neurological disease, responded well and also remain healthy at the time of publication. However, one of the three cats re-treated at the original lower dosage relapsed with neurological disease and was euthanized, while the two remaining cats responded favorably but relapsed a second time. These two cats were successfully treated a third time at the higher dosage, producing 25 long-time survivors. One of the 25 successfully treated cats was subsequently euthanized due to presumably unrelated heart disease, while 24 remain healthy. Conclusions and relevance GS-441524 was shown to be a safe and effective treatment for FIP. The optimum dosage was found to be 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks.","Drugs that inhibit virus replication have become mainstays in the treatment of acute and chronic RNA and DNA virus infections of people. 1 However, interest in antiviral drugs for infections of animals has been much slower to develop. This is especially true for cats, which suffer from several chronic viral infections resembling those in people. The infectious agents include feline leukemia and immunodeficiency viruses (FeLV and FIV, respectively), 2 
Efficacy and safety of the nucleoside analog GS-441524 for treatment of cats with naturally occurring feline infectious peritonitis (FHV) , 3 virulent systemic calicivirus 4,5 and a coronavirus causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV). 6 FeLV and FIV infections have been controlled with testing, isolation and/or vaccination. FHV-associated disease was the first feline viral infection to incorporate an antiviral for treatment. 3 Highly fatal systemic calicivirus affects only a small number of cats. FIPV infection is the best candidate for antiviral drug development as vaccines are ineffective, multi-cat environments make prevention extremely difficult and it kills 0.3-1.4% of cats around the world. [7] [8] [9] The emergence of exotic diseases such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome in people has prompted intensive research into drugs that will inhibit RNA virus replication. One of the most promising antiviral drugs against emerging RNA viruses is the adenosine nucleoside monophosphate prodrug GS-5734 (Remdesivir; Gilead Sciences). GS-5734 has been effective in preventing experimental Ebola in rhesus monkeys, 10 and inhibiting both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses in tissue culture and in mouse infection models. 11 These promising findings prompted initial research on GS-5734 and its parent nucleoside GS-441524 against FIPV infection of cats. 12 GS-441524 and GS-5734 were found to have comparable EC50 (1.0 µM) and CC50 (>100 µM) values against FIPV in cat cells. Therefore, it was decided to concentrate on the less chemically complex GS-441524 for further testing with laboratory cats. A pharmacokinetic study in two laboratory cats demonstrated sustained and effective plasma levels of GS-441524 over 24 h following a single dose given subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV). These results were then extended to 10 laboratory cats with experimentally induced abdominal effusive feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 12 This study showed GS-441524 to be highly effective against experimental FIP and opened the way for the present field trial.
The goal of this study was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of GS-441524 in the treatment of cats with naturally occurring FIP. Small-molecule drugs such as GS-441524 are <900 daltons in weight and around 1 nm in size, and can easily enter cells and interact with key target molecules. Unlike published substances or drugs that inhibit FIPV by hampering cellular processes usurped by viruses for their replication, 13, 14 small molecules like GS-441524 interfere directly with replicative processes encoded by the virus. 12, 15 
Drug preparation GS-441524 was provided by Gilead Sciences as a pure and highly stable powder and diluted to a concentration of 10 or 15 mg/ml in 5% ethanol, 30% propylene glycol, 45% PEG 400, 20% water (pH 1.5 with HCI). The mixture was placed in sterile 50 ml glass injection bottles, agitated until in suspension, and then placed in a sonicated water bath for 5-20 mins until clear. The diluted drug was refrigerated and used within 3-4 weeks.
This study was conducted under protocols 19336 and 19863 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Clinical Trial Review Board of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH) Clinical Trials Committee, University of California (UC), Davis. Institutional rules precluded the use of diseased cats obtained directly from shelters or kitten foster/rescue groups, thus requiring that all cats be legally owned/adopted and treated under specific conditions and with owner consent (supplementary material). The study did not incorporate a control group because there is no effective treatment to compare it against. A placebo treatment group was not included, given that preparatory in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that GS-441524 would be safe and more effective than no treatment. 12 Case selection and disease confirmation Cats with FIP were recruited from owners or their veterinarians seeking current treatment options or access to an earlier antiviral drug trial. 6 The initial diagnosis of FIP was based primarily on characteristic signalment, clinical histories and disease signs, routine laboratory test results, and examination of abdominal or thoracic effusions. A more definitive diagnosis based on RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry was desirable but not essential for inclusion. Cats with obvious ocular or neurological disease were discouraged to enter the trial because of concerns over the ability of antiviral drugs, including GS-441524, to penetrate the blood-brain or blood-eye barriers. 12, 15 Thirty-one cats and their owners were ultimately recruited (Table 1) . Owners or representatives of 26 cats came to UC Davis for initial treatment, and five owners and their cats (CT59, CT73, CT76, CT78, CT80) were treated by their local veterinarian. Cats seen at UC Davis were re-evaluated and their FIP diagnosis reconfirmed based on signalment, clinical history, physical examination, prior laboratory test results and a repeat of complete blood count (CBC), serum protein and effusion analyses. Thoracic or abdominal effusions from cats with wet FIP were confirmed positive for FIPV 7b RNA by RT-PCR. 16 Cats with signs of non-effusive FIP were further tested by abdominal and thoracic ultrasonography for primary lesions. Ocular disease was confirmed by the ophthalmology service of the VMTH, UC Davis. Neurological status in cases with possible central nervous system disease signs was evaluated by the VMTH neurology service.
The initial dosage regimen for GS-441524 was 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h, based on earlier tissue culture experiments and pharmacokinetic studies in laboratory cats. 12 The minimum treatment period was 12 weeks based on experiences with the 3CL protease inhibitor GC376 against naturally occurring FIP. 6 Treatment was extended one or more weeks in cats that still had abnormal serum protein values. The dosage was increased during later stages of the trial from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg in cases where treatment had to be extended or when disease relapses occurred. Owners were sent a new supply of drug every 4 weeks in the form of preloaded 1 or 3 ml Luer lock syringes with 1 inch 22 G Luer hub needles. Syringes were stored in the refrigerator and warmed to room temperature prior to injection. Injections were spaced across the dorsum from 2 cm behind the shoulder blades to the mid-lumbar area and one-half the distance down the adjacent chest and flanks.
Cats were taken off all non-essential treatments such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, interferons, pentoxifylline, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or pain relief medication at the time of entry into the trial. They were then monitored every 12 h during their stay at UC Davis for temperature, appetite, activity, urination and defecation. Blood was also taken at 1-3 day intervals to evaluate hematocrit, total protein, bilirubin, white blood cell count and white cell differential count.
Ascites samples were collected at entry and one or more day intervals for as long as possible and tested for the levels of FIPV 7b RNA transcripts by quantitative (q)RT-PCR (IDEXX Molecular Diagnostics). 16 Immunohistochemistry for the FIPV nucleocapsid protein was performed on formalin-fixed tissue sections from five cats that were necropsied.
Cats were discharged to their owners when a significant favorable response to treatment was noted, usually within 3-5 days. Owners were instructed during this time on how to properly give subcutaneous injections of the drug and encouraged to continue daily logs on body temperature, activity, appetite, defecation and urination, and weekly body weight measurements. A CBC and serum chemistry panel were done at monthly intervals by local veterinarians or during visits to the VMTH, and any abnormal signs or behaviors were to be noted and promptly reported. Euthanasia, when required, was usually conducted by the owner's veterinarian or, when possible, at UC Davis. Bodies were sealed in plastic bags, immediately refrigerated, and shipped within 2 days or less in insulated containers with ice-packs to UC Davis by overnight express mail. Necropsies were performed by one of the authors (ML) in the Anatomic Pathology Service of the School of Veterinary Medicine, UC Davis. The owner's request for the final disposition of the body was honored.
Thirty-one cats ranging from 3.4-73 months of age (mean 13.6 months) were enrolled in the trial (Table 1) . Eighteen cats were domestic short-or longhairs and 13 were pedigreed from 10 different breeds ( Table 1 ). The domestic cats were adopted from kitten/foster rescue organizations (n = 13), formal shelters (n = 2) or obtained as neighborhood strays (n = 3). The study included 14 females (seven intact; seven spayed) and 17 males (one intact; 16 castrated).
Twenty-six of the 31 cats presented with effusive FIP (six thoracic, 20 abdominal). Five cats presented with non-effusive FIP; four of them (CT59, CT64, CT73, CT78) with disease localized to the abdomen (mesenteric and ileo/cecal/colic lymph nodes) and one (CT79) to the chest (lung, hilar lymph nodes) ( Table 1 ). Four other cats had indications of earlier non-effusive FIP that had progressed to the effusive form (CT57, CT65, CT67, CT71) ( Table 1 ). Gross signs of ocular disease consistent with underlying FIP was confirmed by ophthalmoscopic examination in three of the 31 cats (CT56, CT65, CT71). Two cats (CT71, CT80) were either reluctant or no longer able to jump to higher places, suggestive of neurological involvement.
Four cats were euthanized (CT62, CT72, CT75) or died (CT56) within the first 2-5 days because of severe disease and other complications, and a fifth cat was euthanized (CT54) after 26 days owing to a lack of treatment response ( Figure 1 ). Treatment periods were not interrupted except for three cats that were given 2 week respites at week 4 (cat CT80) or week 8 (cats CT53, CT71) because of problems with giving injections and skin reactions ( Figure 1 ). Cat CT53 was treated after a second relapse for 8 rather than 12 weeks because of a rise in blood urea and serum levels of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA).
The clinical response of the 26 cats that completed at least 12 weeks of treatment was dramatic. Fever usually resolved within 12-36 h (Figure 2 ), concurrent with a marked daily improvement in appetite, activity levels and weight gain. Abdominal effusions rapidly disappeared over a 1-2 week period starting around 10-14 days post-treatment. Cats with thoracic effusions were usually dyspneic upon presentation to private veterinarians, prompting removal of pleural effusions prior to coming to UC Davis. Residual dyspnea and thoracic effusion responded rapidly to treatment and were no longer apparent after 7 days. Jaundice slowly resolved over 2-4 weeks, in parallel with decreasing hyperbilirubinemia. Signs of ocular disease began to clear within 24-48 h and were no longer apparent outwardly or by ophthalmoscopic examination by 7-14 days. Enlarged mesenteric and ileo/cecal/colic lymph nodes slowly decreased in size over the course of the treatment. All 26 cats appeared outwardly normal or near normal in the estimation of the owners after 2 weeks of treatment. The emphasis of treatment after 2 weeks was on monitoring several blood test parameters. Key values included packed cell volume (PCV), total white blood cells, absolute lymphocyte count, total serum protein, serum globulin, serum albumin and albumin:globulin (A:G) ratio.
Eighteen of 26 cats that completed at least 12 weeks of uninterrupted primary treatment required no further treatment. However, eight other cats suffered disease relapses within 3-84 days (average 23 days) ( Figure 1 ). This group included the three cats that had temporary breaks in their initial treatment (CT53, CT71, CT80) and five cats (CT53, CT57, CT60, CT68, CT73) that had required extended primary treatment ( Figure 1 ). Disease relapses in 2/8 cats (CT57, CT71) were clearly of a neurological nature with high fever and severe posterior ataxia and incoordination, while disease relapses in the remaining six cats consisted mainly of fever, anorexia and lack of activity. Only one cat (CT60) had an obvious abdominal effusion upon relapse. One cat (CT57) was euthanized 2 weeks after suffering a relapse with neurological signs that failed to respond to a second round of treatment.
A decision was made to increase the dose of GS-441524 from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg in eight of the cats, either because treatment had to be extended (CT77, CT80), because they suffered one (CT60, CT68, CT71, CT73) or two relapses days after stopping treatment). The 24 surviving cats will be carefully monitored for any return of disease signs and periodically tested for total protein, globulin, albumin and A:G ratios for the first year. Less intense monitoring will be maintained for the remainder of the cats' lives. Owners were cautioned to avoid unnecessary stresses on their cats for the first 3 months, although four cats (CT52, CT58, CT65, CT79) were spayed and one cat (CT76) castrated without complications. 
The simplest long-term measure of treatment efficacy was body weight. Weight gains of 20-120% occurred during and following treatment, even in cats 1 year of age and older at disease onset. Younger cats also appeared to grow in stature at an increased rate, as independently noted by owners. These post-treatment surges in growth indicated that FIP was subclinical in many of the cats for some time prior to diagnosis and had affected growth. CBCs and a chemistry profile also proved helpful in monitoring the later effects of treatment and observing for possible drug toxicities.
Cats presented with elevated white blood cell counts, which dropped to normal levels within the first 2 weeks of treatment (Figure 3a) . Lymphopenia was noted at the time of entry and resolved over the first week of treatment (Figure 3b) . A mild to moderately severe anemia was observed at entry, as reflected by the packed cell volume (PCV) (Figure 4) . PCVs did not return to normal levels until after 6-8 weeks of treatment. Therefore, absolute total white cell and lymphocyte counts were only of value during the first week of treatment, while the PCV gave a more accurate picture of treatment progress over the first 8 weeks.
Cats with FIP frequently presented with higher than normal total serum protein concentration, high serum globulin, low serum albumin levels and a low A:G ratio (Figures 5-7) . Abnormal serum protein values improved progressively and reached normal levels after 8-10 weeks of treatment (Figures 5-7) . The level of total protein was the least informative, as indicated by the weak R 2 value (0.1883) for the trend line ( Figure 5 ). However, a dramatic and transient rise in total protein levels occurred 3 weeks into treatment ( Figure 5 ). It was associated with an increase in serum globulins (Figure 6a ) and occurred at a time when abdominal effusions were rapidly resolving. Plasma globulin levels rose during the first 3 weeks of treatment, peaked, and then slowly dropped to a maximum reference value of 4.5 g/dl or lower by week 9 (Figure 6a ). Although globulin levels over time appeared to indicate the status of treatment, the low R 2 value (0.3621) made this a less reliable indicator of treatment progress.
The levels of albumin in serum of the 26 cats treated for at least 12 weeks were usually low (⩽3.2 g/dl) at the time treatment was started (Figure 6b ). Albumin levels then increased slowly and reached normal levels at 8 weeks. The trend line for this rise in albumin had a strong R 2 value (0.79), making serum albumin levels, as well as PCV, a good indicator of treatment progress. As is expected, the A:G ratio showed an equally strong trendline over time and reached a level above 0.70 at around week 8 of treatment (Figure 7) .
Sequential ascites samples were collected from eight cats over the first 2-9 days of antiviral treatment and tested for levels of viral RNA by qRT-PCR (Table 2 ). Whole effusions, or their cell fractions, were the most reliable sources of FIPV RNA. Viral RNA levels decreased, often to undetectable levels, by 2-5 days in 7/8 cats. Only one cat (CT54) failed to show a significant drop in viral RNA levels over a 9 day period.
Focal injection site reactions Injection site reactions were of two types, and whether they were caused by the drug, diluent or both was not determined. Immediate pain reactions were manifested by vocalization, occasional growling and postural changes lasting for 30-60 s. These initial reactions lessened in severity over time as owners became more adept at administering the injection and cats became more adjusted to the routine. Sixteen of 26 treated cats manifested injection site reactions (Table 3) . Reactions were most common during the first 4 weeks and progressed to open sores only in 7/16 cats. Ulcerations healed within 2 weeks by clipping surrounding hair and gently cleaning the wound with a cotton ball soaked in one-part household hydrogen peroxide and two-parts water twice a day. Only three cats had noticeable scars at injection sites. 3 and 4) . Tests for liver and kidney function and levels of amylase/lipase remained normal during and after treatment (supplementary figures S1-S3). The only exception was cat CT53, which had a progressive rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to 35 mg/dl (reference interval [RI] 16-37 µg/dl) and sudden rise in SDMA (20 µg/ dl) (RI 0-14 µg/dl) at 8 weeks into a third round of treatment with the higher 4 mg/kg dosage regimen. Although these signs were still mild in nature, a decision was made to stop treatment out of caution. These abnormalities were not evident on testing 1 month later and the cat is currently in disease remission.
Four cats (CT56, CT62, CT72, CT75) were euthanized or died within 2-5 days of enrollment and necropsies were performed on all but cat CT75. A fifth cat (cat CT54) was euthanized after 26 days of treatment. All five of these cats presented with severe abdominal effusive disease. Cats CT54 and CT56 had evidence upon necropsy of widespread pyogranulomatous vasculitis involving the abdominal viscera, central nervous system and eyes. Cat CT56 also had compromise of the ileal wall in an area of dense infiltrate and secondary bacterial sepsis. Cat CT72 had severe pyogranulomatous vasculitis restricted to the abdomen with moderate-to-severe peripheral edema and mineralization of the adrenal cortices. Cat CT62 suffered from severe pyogranulomatous and fibrinosuppurative peritonitis, which was complicated by an acute gastric perforation associated with plant material and intralesional bacteria indicative of sepsis. Cat CT75 presented with a chronic form of FIP characterized by severe stunting of growth, a massive low protein/low cell abdominal effusion, gallop rhythm indicative of impaired cardiac function, and moderately severe peripheral edema. An echocardiogram showed bilateral atrial enlargement but no indication of primary cardiac disease. The cat appeared to respond to GS-441524 and was discharged. The cat went into shock 2 days later and was euthanized without necropsy.
FIPV was not detected by qRT-PCR in cats CT56, CT72 and CT75 at the time of necropsy, although pretreatment ascites samples had tested positive. Ascites from cat CT54 had tested positive by qRT-PCR throughout treatment ( Table 2 ) and tissues were still positive by immunohistochemistry at the time of necropsy.
Two additional cats were euthanized after successfully completing one or more rounds of treatment. Cat CT57 was normal after one round of treatment but relapsed with severe neurological signs 2 weeks later. The cat failed to respond to retreatment and was euthanized. Lesions typical of FIP were found within the brain and abdomen, but were negative for FIPV by immunohistochemistry for nucleocapsid protein or for 7b RNA by qRT-PCR. Cat CT80 had been successfully 
Most lesions were superficial, involving the epidermis, and required no treatment, while some progressed to open sores that healed within 2 weeks with topical treatment. Some reactions left small permanent scars treated for effusive abdominal FIP but developed intense hindleg and lower back pain 4 weeks later and was euthanized. The cat was found to have pronounced thickening of the left ventricular wall and septum causing severe constriction of the chamber (Figure 8 ).
The microscopic appearance of the left cardiac ventricular wall was typical of congenital feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). No gross or microscopic lesions of FIP were found in the abdomen, chest, eyes, brain or spine, and FIPV antigen and RNA were not detected by qRT-PCR.
GS-441524 is the second targeted antiviral drug after GC376 to be evaluated for the treatment of cats with FIP in the past two to three years. 6, 12, 15 These two drugs inhibited viral replication in two very different manners, either by terminating viral RNA transcription or blocking viral polyprotein cleavage. Both processes are well-established targets for several viral diseases in people. 1 A key question is how treatment with a nucleoside analog compares with that of a viral protease inhibitor. The two drugs gave virtually identical results in tissue culture and experimental cat infection studies. 12, 15 However, efficacy against naturally occurring FIP appeared greater with GS-441524 than GC376. Six of 20 cats treated with GC376 remain in remission to date (Pedersen NC, unpublished data, 2018) compared with 25/31 cats treated with GS-441524. Disease relapses that did not respond to retreatment occurred in 14/20 cats with GC376 and only one cat treated with GS-441524. 6 Eight of the 14 relapses associated with GC376 were neurological in nature, 6 compared with 2/8 relapses with GS-441524. One of two neurological relapses in GS-441524-treated cats responded to retreatment at a higher dosage, whereas neurological relapses with GC376, even with increased dosage, were no longer treatable. 6 Both treatments caused similar injection site reactions. Both drugs appear to be quite safe, although GC376 interfered with the development of permanent teeth when given to younger kittens. 6 Although the results of field testing appear to favor GS-441524, some of the difference may have been influenced by how the two drugs were administered. Efficacy of GC376 may have improved if all 20 cats had been treated without interruption for 12 weeks, rather than treated for progressively longer periods starting at just 2 weeks. 6 Five of the six cats cured with GC376 were among the seven cats that were treated continuously for 12 weeks, while only one of 13 cats treated one or more times for shorter periods of time was cured. These shorter treatment times were essential for determining the 12 week period used for all cats in the present study. The GC376 field trial also involved fewer cats and was constrained by a limited supply of the drug, which made it difficult to test other dosage regimens. Therefore, GC376 should be further studied using a minimum of 12 weeks with a higher dosage and a larger number of cats before making any final comparisons. It would also be important at some time in the future to evaluate both types of drugs in combination, as done for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.
Early deaths must be anticipated in any trial of this type, but how should they be considered in analyzing efficacy? The five early deaths in this study were included in the analysis of GS-441524 efficacy but removed from consideration in the GC376 trial. If they are included in the trial, it is important to determine virus status at the time of death. Viral RNA was not detected in the three necropsied cats that died after 2-5 days of GS-441524 treatment, suggesting that the drug was effective but that the disease process was too far advanced. This did not appear to be the case in a fourth necropsied cat that survived for 26 days; viral RNA levels did not decrease over the entire treatment period and disease signs were unabated. Therefore, it is possible that this cat died because of failure to halt virus replication. Resistance to GS-5734 (Remdesivir), a prodrug of GS-441524, has been associated with amino acid mutations in RNA polymerase and proofreading exonuclease in tissue culture propagated coronaviruses. 17 Whether a similar type of resistance occurred in this cat remains to be determined. Drug resistance was also seen in one cat in the GC376 trial. 6 Fortunately, none of the other cats in the current trial showed signs of drug resistance at any time. However, it is something that needs to be considered in future cats that fail to respond or respond poorly to primary or secondary treatment. The initial dosage of GS-441524 used in the present study was determined from prior pharmacokinetic and experimental infection studies with laboratory cats. 12 These studies indicated that both 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg SC q24h for 14 days would be equally effective for field testing. Therefore, the 2.0 mg/kg dose was chosen for the field trial, as it would cut drug usage by 60%. Although this decision was validated in 18/26 cats, eight other cats either suffered disease relapses (two for a second time) or required longer treatment periods to get key blood values back to normal. Therefore, a decision was made to increase the dosage of GS-441524 from 2.0 mg/kg to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h in cats that relapsed or required extended treatment. The success of 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 such cats, as well as one cat with neurological disease, led us to the conclusion that it was a more effective dosage and should be the basis for future treatment.
It was important to follow simple biological markers of progress over the ⩾12 week treatment periods. PCV, serum total protein, globulin and albumin levels, and the A:G ratio were identified as useful markers. Based on these parameters, it appeared that cats had not completely recovered after 6-10 weeks of treatment. This finding validated the 12 week minimum treatment period determined by an earlier GC376 field trial. 6 Anemia of chronic disease (anemia of inflammation) affects 18-95% of people with acute and chronic infections and is normocytic/normochromic and not associated with iron deficiency. 18, 19 Plasma albumin levels were also a good measure of disease activity, and low albumin and low PCV are known to coincide in situations of chronic disease. 19 Hyperglobulinemia in cats with FIP has been classified as infectious/inflammatory and is caused by increases in all gamma globulin classes and variable increases in alpha-2 globulins. 20 The strong tendency for cats with FIP to have high serum globulin and low albumin levels makes the A:G ratio a particularly good indicator of disease activity. 21 An expectation was that the pedigreed cats would not respond as well to treatment because of a genetic weakness in their ability to respond immunologically to FIPV 22 and that younger cats with effusive FIP would be most responsive. 6 However, the pedigreed cats in the present trial responded equally well as the random-bred cats, and the breeds represented by the cats in the study mainly mirrored the breeds' current popularities. Older cats, and cats with pure non-effusive FIP, also responded as well to GS-441524 treatment as young cats and cats with effusive FIP. If a proportion of cats with ocular and neurological disease can also be successfully treated with GS-441524, no clinical manifestations of FIP should be considered untreatable.
The safety profile of GS-441524 was impressive. No systemic sign of toxicity based on CBC and serum chemistry values was observed over total treatment periods from 12-30 weeks, with one possible exception. One cat (CT53) had a mild rise in BUN and SDMA 8 weeks into a third round of treatment and prompting a halt as a precautionary measure. Based on a previous experience with GC376, 6 there was concern about the effect of GS-441524 on the development of permanent dentition. Three cats (CT52, CT74, CT77) in the present study were 4 months of age or younger and still had their juvenile dentition, and none showed any subsequent dental abnormalities. Injection site reactions were observed with GS-441524, but these were remarkably low in number and were easily treated. It was not determined whether the drug, diluent or both were at fault. The 1.5 pH of the diluent was well below the minimum Food and Drug Administration (FDA) threshold of 4.5, but drugs of this type are difficult to solubilize and stabilize at more physiologic pH. Nonetheless, more physiologic diluents should be evaluated.
One cat in the study (CT80) had confounding clinical signs. Although the cat presented with effusive abdominal FIP, it also had long-standing signs of vague hindlimb lameness, lower back pain, periodic bouts of falling, reluctance to jump to higher places, and unexplainable and transient changes in behavior. These signs prompted the cat to be treated for a long time after the abdominal effusion disappeared. A decision was ultimately made to discontinue treatment and see if more characteristic FIP signs would recur. The cat was ultimately euthanized and found to have congenital-type HCM and no residual lesions of FIP or viral RNA in any tissues upon necropsy. Dilated cardiomyopathy has been reported in 17.6% of HIV-infected people on chronic antiretroviral therapy. 23 It was concluded, however, that GS-441524 was not the cause of the heart disease in this cat. Heart disease in this cat was hypertrophic rather than the dilative form seen in patients with HIV, and HCM is a common condition among shelter cats. 24
The results obtained from the 31 cats treated with GS-441524 exceeded expectations and indicate that FIP, regardless of signalment or disease form, is a treatable disease using nucleoside analogs. The study design and treatment parameters determined from this limited field trial will be essential for future efforts in the commercialization of this or similar drugs against FIP. who assisted with periodic blood testing and were there for us and their patients/owners when needed.

110,148a0ab3b9bb851a56bbe926abed11c0d71fc61c,"Background: Fecal calprotectin and immunoglobulin A (IgA) are markers of intestinal inflammation and immunity in adult dogs.
Hypothesis: Fecal calprotectin and IgA concentrations in puppies are not influenced by fecal moisture in puppies but by enteropathogen shedding.
Animals: Three hundred and twenty-four puppies. Methods: Fecal consistency was assessed by gross examination. Fecal moisture was evaluated before and after lyophilization. Canine parvovirus and coronavirus were detected in feces by qPCR and qRT-PCR respectively. Giardia intestinalis antigen was quantified by ELISA. The standard McMaster flotation technique was used to detect eggs and oocysts in feces. Fecal calprotectin and IgA concentrations were quantified by in-house radioimmunoassays.
Results: For each marker (IgA and calprotectin), a strong positive correlation was observed between concentration in fresh feces and concentration in fecal dry matter. 75.6% of the puppies were found to be infected by at ≥1 of the enteropathogens evaluated. Fecal calprotectin concentration was significantly influenced by age (P = .001), with higher concentrations in younger puppies, but not by viral (P = .863) or parasitic infection (P = .791). Fecal IgA concentration was significantly influenced by enteropathogen shedding (P = .01), with a lower fecal IgA concentration in puppies shedding at ≥1 enteropathogen compared to puppies without any enteropathogen shedding, but not by age.
Conclusions: Fecal calprotectin and IgA are of no diagnostic value to detect presence of enteropathogens in clinically healthy puppies or puppies with abnormal feces, but could help to better understand the maturation of digestive tract.","I n dogs, gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases are the third most frequent problem reported by owners in United States and Australia. 1 In the United Kingdom, a survey based on client questionnaires reported that up to 15% of dogs experienced mild diarrhea over a 2-week period. 2 Another study observed that, among sick animals presented for veterinary consultation, 7% of visits were related to diarrhea. 3 Diarrhea is even more frequent in young dogs <6 months of age than in adult dogs, with 25% of puppies having abnormal feces during the weaning period. 4, 5 Diarrhea during this period is a major problem as it can decrease daily weight gain and increase the risk of death. 6 As in other species, diarrhea is multifactorial, involving factors intrinsic to the dog (eg, breed size and age), nutritional factors (eg, diet change without transition, food type and quality), infectious diseases, and also lifestyle and environmental stressors. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Major enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in weanling puppies are canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2), 12 the Cystoisospora ohioensis-complex, Cystoisospora canis, 13 and Giardia duodenalis. 14 Co-infections by these enteropathogens are frequently reported in puppies. 4, 5 Several diagnostic tests (such as PCR, antigen testing by ELISA, and fecal examination) must be combined for accurate diagnosis in cases of diarrhea in weanling puppies. However, the use of such routine testing can be difficult and expensive.
In young children with gastroenteritis, several fecal markers are used to assess shedding of enteropathogens excreted, and to evaluate intestinal inflammation or local immunity. 15 Calprotectin and immunoglobulin A (IgA) are 2 of these markers. Calprotectin is a heterodimeric protein complex mainly present in neutrophils, monocytes, and reactive macrophages. In humans, fecal calprotectin concentrations were reported to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis compared to healthy controls. 16, 17 Moreover, they also correlated with disease severity as quantified by endoscopy and histologic examination of biopsy specimens. 18 In adult dogs with chronic diarrhea, significantly higher serum and fecal calprotectin concentrations have been reported compared to healthy dogs. 19, 20 Sensitivity and specificity of fecal calprotectin for discriminating adult dogs with severe chronic diarrhea (Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index [CCECAI] ≥ 12) from dogs with mild to moderate clinical signs (CCECAI < 12) were 53 and 92%, respectively, when a cut-off value of 49 lg/g was used. 19 Secretory IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin subtype present in secretions, protecting mucosal surfaces from infectious agents. Therefore, fecal IgA concentration may serve as a marker of mucosal immunity. 21 In dogs, fecal secretory IgA concentrations previously have been used to evaluate intestinal immunity. 22, 23 For interpretation of fecal IgA and calprotectin concentrations, how they are affected by physiological factors such as breed size or age must be taken into account. The canine species is characterized by large interbreed variations, primarily by stature. The digestive physiology of dogs is also known to differ slightly according to breed size. In large breed dogs, such as German shepherds or Great Danes, fecal moisture content is higher, soft stools are more frequent and the number of defecations is higher than in small breed dogs. 7, 10, 11, 24 This difference may be a result of lower mineral absorption, higher fermentative activity reflecting higher intestinal permeability and a longer transit time, or both. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] The same variation has been described in puppies, with large breed puppies having feces of lower consistency compared to small breed puppies. 6 Age also affects concentrations of markers. Indeed, lower fecal IgA concentrations were described in puppies <6 months of age compared to adult dogs. 31, 32 In humans, an effect of age on fecal calprotectin concentration has been described with higher concentrations being observed in healthy children compared to healthy adults. 33 The same variation has been described between healthy puppies and healthy adults, but these results were obtained from dogs housed in the same breeding kennel. 32 Therefore, the aims of our study were to determine if calprotectin and IgA are influenced by fecal moisture (Study 1) and to evaluate if these fecal markers can be useful to detect infection by an enteropathogen (virus, parasite, or both) in puppies, taking into account the effect of 2 potential biases, age and breed size (Study 2).
The protocols of both studies were reviewed and approved by Royal Canin Internal Ethics Committee.
A total of 70 purebred puppies from 18 litters from 10 different breeding kennels were included. Each puppy was identified by a colored collar and its age and breed were recorded. Depending on the mean adult body weight of their respective breed, puppies were categorized into 2 groups (small breed if the mean adult body weight was <25 kg; otherwise large breed). For each puppy, fecal consistency was evaluated by a single operator using a 13-point scale, based on the texture and shape of the feces (from liquid to hard and dry). 6 Fresh feces were collected and weighed for each dog. If the stool volume defecated was sufficient (≥15 g), stools were separated into 3 aliquots, 1 for fecal moisture evaluation and 2 for measurement of fecal calprotectin and IgA concentrations. Water content of the stools was determined by weighing feces before and after lyophilization. 30 Calprotectin and IgA were quantified by inhouse radioimmunoassays after extraction, as previously described. 22, 32, 34 All samples were analyzed using the same batch of tracer and reagents. To correct for fecal moisture, results for each marker were expressed as concentrations in fresh feces and also normalized to dry matter.
A total of 254 purebred puppies from 64 litters from 33 different French breeding kennels were included. Puppies vaccinated within the preceding 10 days before the visit and puppies with clinical signs of weakness, dehydration, or anorexia were not included in the study. However, puppies with an abnormal fecal quality were included in the study. Each puppy was identified by a colored collar and its age and breed were recorded. Depending on the mean adult body weight of their respective breed, puppies were categorized into small breed size or large breed size as described above. For each puppy, fecal consistency was evaluated by a single operator using a 13-point scale as previously described. 6 Based on growth rate deterioration, thresholds for abnormal feces in puppies were previously validated and appeared to vary with breed stature and age. 6 Briefly, feces with a score ≤5 were classified as abnormal for large breed puppies regardless of age. For small breed puppies, fecal scores ≤6 and ≤7 were classified as abnormal for 4-5 week old puppies and for older puppies between 6 and 8 weeks old respectively.
After collection, fecal samples were separated into 3 aliquots: 5 g of fresh feces were stored at +4°C for fecal examination and the other 2 samples were frozen at À20°C for Giardia intestinalis antigen quantification and measurement of fecal calprotectin and IgA concentrations respectively.
A rectal swab (medical dry swab, cotton tip diameter 2 mm a ) was collected from each puppy immediately after stool collection for detection of CPV2 and canine coronavirus (CCV). The swabs were stored at À20°C until DNA extraction.
Fecal examination was performed by the standard McMaster flotation technique using a saturated magnesium sulfate solution (density: 1.28 g/mL). 35 All eggs and oocysts were identified according to their morphological characteristics under light microscopy by a single operator. 36, 37 Copro-antigens of G. intestinalis were quantified by ELISA b in 100 mg of feces. [38] [39] [40] An optical density value >0.05 was considered positive according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Feces were evaluated for the presence of DNA and RNA from CPV2 and CCV by qPCR and qRT-PCR, respectively, as previously described. 6 Results from duplicate PCR analyses from the extracted DNA (ie, 2 PCR assay were performed for each fecal extract) were expressed semiquantitatively as virus loads. Puppies were defined as infected by CPV2 and CCV if viral loads were >10 10.3 and 10 9.3 copies respectively. 6 After extraction, calprotectin and IgA were quantified by inhouse radioimmunoassays as previously described. 22, 32, 34 All samples were analyzed using the same batch of tracer and reagents.
Data are shown as the median and range (min-max). Statistical analyses were performed using a commercial software package. c Spearman's rho correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between fecal concentrations of each marker in fresh feces and fecal dry matter.
Number of puppies with positive and negative fecal test results for each enteropathogen was tabulated by age of the puppies. The significance of the univariate association between age and the shedding of each enteropathogen was determined using chi-squared-tests. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant.
To assess the association between enteropathogens sheddings and fecal IgA and calprotectin concentrations in puppies, 4 statistical models were performed for each marker. In a first step, univariate analyses (Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests) were performed to evaluate a possible association of each factor on either fecal marker. Variables examined included age of puppies (5-6/7-8/9-11 weeks of age), breed size (small/large), fecal quality (normal/abnormal), G. inestinalis, C. ohioensis complex, C. canis, Toxocara canis, CPV2, and CCV shedding (yes/no), shedding of ≥1virus (yes/no), shedding of ≥1parasite (yes/no), and shedding of ≥1 enteropathogen (yes/no). In a second step, relationships between shedding of enteropathogens and fecal marker concentrations were evaluated in 3 different linear mixed models for each marker. In a first linear mixed model, effects of each pathogen (shedding of each pathogen [yes/no]) on either marker were evaluated. In a second linear mixed model, influence of the type of enteropathogens (shedding of ≥1 parasite [yes/no] and shedding of ≥1 virus [yes/no]) on either fecal marker was evaluated. In a last linear mixed model, global effect of enteropathogens (shedding of ≥1 enteropathogen [yes/no]) on both fecal markers was evaluated. In all of these mixed models, breed size and age of puppies were included as fixed effects and litter variable nested within breeding kennel was defined as a random term. For each model, the normality of residuals distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. According to residuals distribution for each of the multivariable models, the outcome was log transformed (fecal calprotectin concentration) or rank transformed (fecal IgA concentration). Differences were considered significant for P values <.05. Quantitative data are presented as medians with ranges.
Seventy puppies (64 classified as belonging to a large breed) were included in the study (mean age, 8.8 weeks; range 6-14 weeks). Among these, 29 (41%) puppies defecated a sufficient volume of feces. These puppies consisted of large breed puppies between 6 and 10 weeks of age (mean age, 8.5 weeks). A median fecal score of 7 was obtained (range, 3-10; Fig 1) in the 29 puppies that defecated a sufficient volume of feces. Fecal moisture ranged from 50 to 77.2% (median, 66.7%), with a strong negative correlation with fecal scores (r, À0.59; P = .001; Fig 2) .
Fecal calprotectin concentrations in fresh feces ranged from 2.9 to 59.5 lg/g (median, 10.5 lg/g), and from 5.8 to 200.8 lg/g (median, 32.2 lg/g) in fecal dry matter. A strong positive correlation was observed between fecal calprotectin concentration both in fresh feces and in fecal dry matter (r, 0.98; P < .001; Fig 3) . A moderate negative correlation was observed between fecal scores and fecal calprotectin concentrations in fresh feces and in fecal dry matter (r, À0.38; P = .045; and r, À0.49; P = .007 respectively).
Fecal IgA concentrations in fresh feces ranged from 0.3 to 24.2 mg/g (median, 3.6 mg/g) and from 0.9 to 62.3 mg/g (median, 11.8 mg/g) in fecal dry matter. A strong positive correlation was observed between fecal IgA concentrations in fresh feces and in fecal dry matter (r, 0.97; P < .001; Fig 4) . A moderate negative correlation was observed between fecal scores and fecal IgA concentrations in either fresh feces or fecal dry matter (r, À0.53; P = .003 and r, À0.64; P < .001 respectively).
Among the 254 puppies included in the study, 180 (71%) were large breed puppies. Puppies were between 5 and 11 weeks of age (mean, 7.7 weeks). The mean number of puppies included in each kennel was 8 (range, 1-18). A median fecal score of 8 was obtained (range, 1-12; Fig 1) . In general, 2 different enteric viruses and 4 parasites were identified (Table 1) . At least 1 enteropathogen was identified in 75.6% (192/254) of the puppies. 71.7% (182/254) of puppies were infected by ≥1 parasite and 37% (94/254) by ≥1 of the 2 viruses tested. One-third (84/254) of the puppies were infected simultaneously with ≥1 virus and 1 parasite ( Table 2 ). Puppies between 5 and 8 weeks of age had a significantly higher prevalence of C. ohioensis complex and a lower prevalence of CCV and G. duodenalis than puppies between 9 and 11 weeks of age (Table 1) .
Fecal calprotectin concentrations ranged from 2.9 to 421.4 lg/g feces (median, 15.2 lg/g feces). Of the 254 puppies included, 44 (17%) had a fecal concentration >49 lg/g feces (threshold of clinical interest). 19 Fecal calprotectin concentration was significantly affected by age (P = .001) but not by breed size (P = .217), viral infection (CPV2, CCV, or both ; P = .863), or parasitic infection (G. duodenalis, C. ohioensis complex, C. canis, T. canis, or both; P = .791; Table 3 ). Fecal calprotectin concentration was not associated with fecal score (P = .851). The concentration of fecal calprotectin was higher and more variable in younger puppies between 5 and 8 weeks of age than in the older puppies (9-11 weeks of age; Fig 5) . Twenty-two, 21, and 7% of puppies had fecal calprotectin concentrations >49 lg/g feces at, respectively, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-11 weeks of age.
Fecal IgA concentration ranged from 0.1 to 27.2 mg/g feces (median, 4.5 mg/g feces). In contrast with calprotectin, IgA concentration was significantly influenced by enteropathogen shedding (P = .01) but by none of the other factors tested (Table 4 ). Fecal IgA concentrations were 1.4 times lower in puppies that were shedding at least 1 enteropathogen (median, 4.1 mg/g feces; range, 0.1-22.7 mg/g feces) than in puppies without enteropathogen shedding (median, 5.7 mg/g feces; range, 0.5-27.2 mg/g feces; Fig 6) . Fecal IgA concentration was not found to be associated with fecal score (P = .891).
Diarrhea is common in puppies around the time of weaning, and may be accompanied by slowed growth of the puppies. 6 Viral and parasitic infections are very common in young puppies and are involved in weanling diarrhea. 5, 6, 14, [41] [42] [43] The early detection of such infections would avoid growth retardation and could decrease the development of more severe forms of the disease. Thus, noninvasive markers of digestive health, the concentrations of which might be modified by the presence of enteropathogens, would be of great utility in these patients. Thus, our study investigated 2 fecal markers, calprotectin and IgA, used in human pediatric gastroenterology for their utility in weanling puppies. In our study, puppies that shed ≥1 enteropathogen had significantly lower fecal IgA concentrations than did puppies without any enteropathogen shedding identified. This lower fecal IgA concentration may be a cause or a consequence of the enteropathogen shedding. Immunoglobulin A can actively bind microrganisms, enterotoxins, and other antigens, and prevent adherence and subsequent penetration of the intestinal wall. Thus, a lower fecal IgA concentration could be caused by IgA being utilized in antigen binding or by enterohepatic recirculation of IgA. After IgA binds an antigen in the intestinal lumen, it is either excreted in the feces or is actively reabsorbed for destruction of the microorganism or virus by hepatic Kuppfer cells. Reabsorption of IgA could have been increased by an infection with an enteropathogen, which could result in decreased fecal concentrations of IgA. Conversely, the lower fecal IgA concentration also could indicate the presence of altered local immunity and thus serve as evidence for a higher risk of infection with an enteropathogen. A positive impact of fecal IgA on protection against infectious diseases already has been described in other species. Mice lacking secretory IgA exhibit a significant delay in clearance of rotavirus infection compared with mice that have secretory IgA. 44 In children, fecal IgA concentrations also were shown to have an influence on protection against rotavirus infection and resulting disease. 45 No significant effect of any viral (CCV or CPV2) or parasite shedding (G. duodenalis, C. ohioensis complex, C. canis, or T. canis) on fecal calprotectin concentration was observed. This lack of difference in calprotectin concentrations between dogs that showed enteropathogen shedding and those that did not could be explained by the population of dogs enrolled in our study (ie, healthy puppies or puppies presenting only with an abnormal fecal quality without any other clinical sign). In humans, the patient's clinical status influences the concentrations of this marker. In children who are clinically healthy but infected by Giardia, no effect on fecal calprotectin concentration was described. 33 However, in human patients with viral gastroenteritis, fecal calprotectin concentrations were reported to be associated with the severity of clinical signs. 46 In our study, 18.9% of puppies were found to be excreting a high load of CPV2 but without any of the typical clinical signs (eg, hemorrhagic diarrhea, vomiting, prostration, dehydration, anorexia). This healthy carrier state could explain the lack of association between shedding of this virus and fecal calprotectin concentrations. Another study comparing fecal calprotectin concentrations among healthy puppies, puppies with an abnormal fecal quality, and puppies with clinical parvovirus infection would be needed to further elucidate this relationship.
Fecal moisture in our study ranged from 50 to 77.2% (median, 66.7%), with a negative correlation with fecal scores, which is accordance with previous studies. 10, 30 A negative correlation also was observed between fecal markers and fecal score. The higher IgA and calprotectin concentrations in puppies with liquid or soft feces in this study do not seem to be a direct consequence of stool consistency (dilution) because this negative correlation was observed for fresh feces as well as for concentrations based on fecal dry matter. The negative correlation between fecal score and fecal marker concentration could be explained by the effect of age acting as a confounding factor. Indeed age influence feces quality (lower fecal score in very young puppies) 6 and, at the same time, age influences fecal concentrations of both markers (higher fecal concentrations in very young puppies). 47 Our study indicates that fecal calprotectin concentrations decrease and stabilize with age. This result is in accordance with our longitudinal study performed in young dogs around the age of weaning. 47 In humans, considerably higher fecal calprotectin concentrations also have been observed in infants around the time of birth compared with those in healthy older children and adults. 33, [48] [49] [50] In our study, 17% of puppies had high fecal calprotectin concentrations (>49 lg/g) similar to those observed in adult dogs with inflammatory bowel disease, with large interindividual variations. 19 These high concentrations do not appear to be linked to viral or parasite shedding because this effect of age on fecal calprotectin concentrations was still observed when both variables (age and enteropathogen shedding) were taken into consideration within the same statistical model. Moreover, we previously observed a spontaneous normalization of fecal calprotectin concentrations in healthy puppies during the weaning period. 47 The type of food (eg, natural milk, industrial milk, dry food) may have influenced fecal calprotectin concentrations. Human infants who are exclusively breastfed show significantly higher fecal calprotectin concentrations compared to those receiving a mixed diet. 49, 51 The effect of natural milk may depend on several factors such as hormones (eg, ghrelin, leptin), cytokines and other immunostimulants and growth factors (eg, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte colonystimulating factor), which all contribute to the development of the gastrointestinal immune system. 51 Milk ingestion was not controlled in our study, with puppies having free access to maternal milk. However, from 5 to 8 weeks of age, the proportion of natural maternal milk decreases continuously in a puppie's diet because of physiologic progressive weaning. Developmental processes occurring in the digestive tract during this period of life also could explain the higher fecal calprotectin concentrations. During the first weeks of life, intestinal permeability is higher 52 , which may lead to transepithelial migration of neutrophils, as observed in adults with inflammatory bowel disease. 53 The physiological establishment and stabilization of the gut microbiota also may have an effect on calprotectin release as has been suggested in humans. 54, 55 The higher calprotectin concentrations observed also could be linked to bacterial gastrointestinal infections as described in children. 15, 56 
Our study indicates that fecal calprotectin and IgA are of no diagnostic value to detect the presence of an enteropathogen in clinically healthy puppies or puppies with abnormal feces. However, these markers might be useful to better understand the maturation of the digestive tract, the development of systemic and local immunity, and the establishment and stabilization of the gut microbiota. The development of noninvasive fecal biomarkers that may prove to be useful to evaluate gastrointestinal health in puppies remains a challenge.

111,b41e1c74739ae2195dc07a54fd9decaff5639b45,"Secondary lymphoid organ chemokine (SLC) is expressed in high endothelial venules and in T cell zones of spleen and lymph nodes (LNs) and strongly attracts naive T cells. In mice homozygous for the paucity of lymph node T cell ( plt ) mutation, naive T cells fail to home to LNs or the lymphoid regions of spleen. Here we demonstrate that expression of SLC is undetectable in plt mice. In addition to the defect in T cell homing, we demonstrate that dendritic cells (DCs) fail to accumulate in spleen and LN T cell zones of plt mice. DC migration to LNs after contact sensitization is also substantially reduced. The physiologic significance of these abnormalities in plt mice is indicated by a markedly increased sensitivity to infection with murine hepatitis virus. The plt mutation maps to the SLC locus; however, the sequence of SLC introns and exons in plt mice is normal. These findings suggest that the abnormalities in plt mice are due to a genetic defect in the expression of SLC and that SLC mediates the entry of naive T cells and antigen-stimulated DCs into the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs.","S econdary lymphoid organs are the predominant site of lymphocyte sensitization to novel antigens. Their function requires the colocalization of two distinct populations of leukocytes: antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) 1 and antigen-responsive naive lymphocytes (1) . Chemokines, a rapidly growing family of small chemotactic cytokines, are believed to provide the signals that guide leukocytes to their proper location within lymphoid organs (2, 3) . Several recently identified chemokines have been suggested to mediate the constitutive trafficking of leukocytes based on their in vitro characteristics and their expression in lymphoid tissues (4) . A role for chemokines in B cell localization was shown by a targeted disruption of the chemokine receptor Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, the involvement of chemokines in the localization of either T cells or DCs within lymphoid organs has not been directly demonstrated.
DCs are distributed throughout the body at sites where they can capture antigens (9) . In response to an inflammatory stimulus, these cells migrate into afferent lymphatics, then are carried to draining LNs where they are deposited in the subcapsular space. From the subcapsular space, DCs migrate into T cell zones where they take up residence as interdigitating DCs and present MHC-bound antigens and costimulatory molecules to passing lymphocytes (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . To sample this antigen repertoire, T lymphocytes that have never been stimulated by antigen (naive T cells) migrate or ""home"" specifically to the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs. In LNs and Peyer's patches (PPs), lymphocytes leave the blood through specialized high endothelial venules (HEVs) by a series of discrete steps which include selectin-mediated rolling, integrin activation, integrinmediated firm adhesion, and endothelial extravasation (16, 17) . In spleen, which lacks HEVs, lymphocytes exit the blood in the marginal zone and migrate to the T cell zone within the splenic white pulp by a poorly understood route (18) . Within the T cell zones of these lymphoid organs, a 452 Leukocyte Trafficking in Mice Lacking SLC continuous flow of naive T cells sample the antigens presented by DCs. Most of these lymphocytes eventually return to the circulation. The few that encounter their cognate antigen are retained within the T cell zone, undergo clonal expansion, and differentiate into effector or memory T cells.
SLC (also known as 6Ckine, Exodus-2, and TCA4 [19] [20] [21] [22] ) is a recently identified chemokine that is expressed in the HEVs of LNs and PPs, in nondendritic stromal cells within the T cell areas of LNs, spleen, and PPs, in the thymic medulla, and in the lymphatic endothelium of multiple tissues (22, 23) . SLC has been hypothesized to mediate the homing of naive lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid tissues based on several findings (23) . SLC is the only chemokine known to be constitutively expressed in the endothelial cells of HEVs (23) . SLC stimulates the chemotaxis of naive T cells and, to a lesser extent, memory T cells and B cells (23, 24) . SLC stimulates both the ␣ L ␤ 2 integrinmediated adhesion of T cells to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and the ␣ 4 ␤ 7 integrin-mediated adhesion of these cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MadCAM)-1 (23, 25, 26) . Activated ␣ L ␤ 2 function is essential for lymphocyte homing to LNs and PPs, and activated ␣ 4 ␤ 7 is required for homing to PPs. Under physiologic flow conditions, SLC stimulates the arrest of rolling T cells with an efficiency and subset specificity (naive versus memory) similar to that seen in vivo (27) . These properties strongly suggest that SLC mediates the homing of naive T cells and perhaps other lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs; however, this has not been demonstrated directly.
Recently, Nakano et al. described an autosomal recessive mutation in mice, paucity of lymph node T cells ( plt ), which leads to a defect in the homing of naive T lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs (28, 29) . plt mice have greatly decreased numbers of naive T lymphocytes in LNs, PPs, and the white pulp of spleen. When injected into plt mice, T lymphocytes from wild-type ( ϩ / ϩ ) mice fail to enter LNs and PPs and accumulate only in the red pulp of spleen, whereas lymphocytes from plt mice home normally in ϩ / ϩ mice. These findings demonstrate that the plt defect affects a gene expressed in the lymphoid organ stroma. Although the exact mutation has not been identified, the plt locus maps to mouse chromosome 4 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 9p13. Two known human chemokine genes map to 9p13: SLC and EBV-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine (ELC) (19) .
In view of the lymphocyte homing defects in plt mice, we hypothesized that the plt mutation involves the murine SLC gene. Here we report that SLC mRNA is not expressed in plt mice. We also explore the possibility that lack of SLC expression in these mice leads to additional leukocyte trafficking abnormalities. Hence, we also find that plt mice have abnormalities in the localization of DCs within lymphoid organs, in the migration of DCs to LNs, and are severely immunocompromised. Our findings suggest that the abnormalities in plt mice are due to a genetic defect in the expression of SLC and that SLC is required for the entry of both naive T lymphocytes and antigen-bearing DCs into the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs.
Reagents and Antibodies. FITC (isomer 1) and LPS (serotype 055:B5) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Metrizamide A.G. was obtained from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co. The following anti-mouse antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry and FACS ® analysis: biotinylated anti-CD11c, biotinylated anti-IgM a , biotinylated anti-B220, biotinylated anti-CD3, biotinylated anti-I-Ad, FITC-conjugated anti-I-Ad, PE-conjugated anti-I-Ad, and anti-CD4 (PharMingen); NLDC-145 and MOMA-1 (Bachem). The following secondary reagents were used when applicable: avidin-conjugated FITC (avidin-FITC), streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (SA-AP), and SAconjugated horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP; Vector Labs); AP-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig (anti-rat Ig-AP; PharMingen); HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig (anti-rat Ig-HRP; Caltag Laboratories); and SA-conjugated peridinine chlorophyll protein (SA-PerCP; Becton Dickinson). Cells were suspended in RPMI/ 25 mM HEPES/5% FCS unless otherwise noted.
Mice. BALB/c-plt / plt mice were produced by backcrossing plt mice 10 generations into a BALB/c genetic background as described previously (29) . BALB/c control mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. All experiments were performed on 6-10-wk-old age-and sex-matched mice maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. RNA Expression Studies. For Northern analysis, mRNA from tissues of wild-type and plt mice was subjected to gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-N ϩ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed using randomly primed mouse SLC, ELC, and actin cDNA. For in situ hybridizations, paraffin sections (5 m) from ϩ / ϩ and plt mice were deparaffinized, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and treated with proteinase K. After washing in 0.5 ϫ SSC, the sections were covered with hybridization solution, prehybridized for 1-3 h at 55 Њ C, and hybridized overnight with sense or antisense 35 S-labeled riboprobe transcribed from the mouse SLC or ELC cDNA. After hybridization, sections were washed at high stringency, dehydrated, dipped in photographic emulsion NTB 2 (Eastman Kodak Co.), stored at 4 Њ C for 8 wk, developed, and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue samples of spleen and LNs were frozen in OCT, and 10-m cryostat sections were prepared. Sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min, air dried, blocked with PBS/5% normal goat serum for 30 min, and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h. Slides were then washed in PBS, incubated with either SA-AP and anti-rat HRP or anti-rat AP and SA-HRP for 30 min, and developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) followed by Vector Red (Vector Labs) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Flow Cytometry. For DC quantitation, mesenteric, inguinal, axillary, and brachial LNs from four plt and two ϩ / ϩ mice were pooled, and single cell suspensions were prepared. RBCs were depleted by lysis, and cells at 5 ϫ 10 6 /ml were layered onto metrizamide (14.5 g/100 ml medium) and centrifuged for 10 min at 600 g . Cells at the interface were collected, washed, and resuspended in medium, stained with FITC-conjugated anti-I-Ad, and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan ® (Becton Dickinson). Spleen cells were isolated as described previously (30) . In brief, spleens were minced, incubated for 1 h at 37 Њ C in RPMI with 130 U/ml collagenase and 0.1 mg/ml DNase, teased through 70-m nylon mesh, and centrifuged. RBCs were depleted by lysis, then cells were washed once and resuspended. Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-I-Ad, biotinylated anti-B220, and biotinylated anti-CD3 followed by SA-PerCP and analyzed by flow cytometry. For DC quantitation, cells were gated against B220 and CD3 and analyzed for expression of I-Ad.
Contact Sensitization. The shaved abdomens of mice were painted with 0.4 ml of 5 mg/ml FITC dissolved in a 50:50 (vol/ vol) mixture of acetone and dibutylphthalate. After 24 h, cell suspensions of pooled inguinal, axillary, and brachial LNs were prepared from each mouse and analyzed by flow cytometry. In some experiments, aliquots of LN cells were stained with biotinylated anti-CD11c followed by SA-PerCP. To determine I-A expression on FITC ϩ cells, aliquots of LN cells from four mice were pooled, partially purified on metrizamide, stained with biotinylated anti-I-Ad followed by SA-PerCP, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For sensitization with a lower dose of antigen, 25 l of 8 mg/ml FITC was spotted on the shaved right flank of five ϩ / ϩ and five plt mice. After 24 h, the draining and contralateral inguinal LNs were removed and analyzed individually. Single cell suspensions were quantitated, stained with anti-I-Ad and anti-B220, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Skin DC Migration and Staining. Skin explant culture, preparation of dermal and epidermal whole mounts, and staining of DCs were performed as described previously (31) . In brief, ears were rinsed with 70% ethanol and split with forceps into dorsal and ventral halves. Dorsal ear halves were floated directly on 2 ml of complete medium in 24-well plates for 3 d. Epidermal and dermal sheets were prepared by floating ear halves (fresh or cultured) or freshly prepared abdominal skin dermal side down on 0.5 M ammonium thiocyanate for 20 min at 37 Њ C. Epidermis was separated from dermis with fine forceps and stained immediately. Epidermal and dermal sheets were cut into 3 ϫ 3-mm sections, fixed in acetone for 30 min, and rehydrated in PBS. They were incubated in 1:20 biotinylated anti-I-Ad overnight at 4 Њ C, washed in PBS three times, and incubated with SA-FITC at 1:100 for 90 min at room temperature. After three washes, sheets were mounted on microscope slides and evaluated by UV microscopy. Nonadherent migratory cells were recovered from the bottom of tissue culture wells after 72 h by gentle rinsing. Aliquots were counted and cells were cytospun onto microscope slides for staining with 1:100 biotinylated anti-I-Ad using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs) and DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. The proportion of I-A ϩ cells was determined by examining 10 fields/slide over 3 slides. Viral Infection. Mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), was propagated and plaque assayed on DBT cells as described previously (32, 33) . A single pool of virus was divided into aliquots and stored at Ϫ 80 Њ C until use. Mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2-2 ϫ 10 6 PFU of MHV-A59 in a 0.2 ml vol. Mortality was assessed at 14 d after infection. LD 50 were calculated by the PROBIT method.
Sequence Analysis. DNA fragments for sequencing were generated by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from ϩ / ϩ and plt mice with the following primer pairs (position of products relative to transcriptional start site is listed in parentheses): GTCAACCTGGTCTATGAATCCCAG and CACGACATC-ACACTGAACCGATC ( Ϫ 1025 to Ϫ 428); GCTCAGCACTTA-TGGAAGGGTG and GCCATGATTGTGGTTGAGTTGAG ( Ϫ 598 to 59); TCTCACCTACAGCTCTGGTCTCATC and GTGAACCACCCAGCTTGAAGTTC (12 to 779); CTGGA-AAGAAAGGAAAGGGCTC and ATGGAGAGCAGGTTCA-GGTCTTGG (571 to 1046); CTTCAACCATTACATCTG-CACGG and TTTACTCCTGCCTGGGGATAGG (873 to 1965). PCR was performed using a Perkin Elmer 9600 thermal cycler in a final volume of 50 l containing 5 U AmpliTaq enzyme with its 1 ϫ buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 1 M of each primer. Samples were heated to 94 Њ C for 4 min, AmpliTaq was added, and samples were cycled for 35 cycles at 94 Њ C for 30 s, 60 Њ C for 1 min, and 72 Њ C for 1 min. PCR products were cloned into PCRII TA (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced using dye terminator technology.
Lack of SLC Expression in plt Mice. The expression pattern of SLC mRNA and protein in normal mice has been determined (22, 23) . To examine the expression of SLC in plt mice, in situ hybridization on tissue sections was performed using 35 S-labeled SLC antisense riboprobe. No SLC mRNA was detected in any tissue of plt mice, includ- ing LN, spleen, PP, thymus, and lymphatic endothelium, whereas the location and abundance of SLC mRNA was normal in the same tissues of ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 1 , A-F, and data not shown). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from peripheral LNs and spleen confirmed the complete absence of SLC transcripts in plt mice (Fig. 1 G) .
Decreased Accumulation of DCs in the T Cell Zones of plt Mice. plt mice have a defect in the homing of naive T cells that leads to a marked decrease in the number of these cells in the T cell zones of LNs, PPs, and spleen. The finding that SLC is not expressed in plt mice strongly supports the hypothesis that SLC is required for naive T cell homing. Like naive T cells, activated DCs migrate to the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs. Therefore, we examined the distribution of DCs in plt mice. By FACS ® analysis, DC numbers were decreased 60% in the LNs of plt mice (Fig. 2 A) . The average number of total I-A ϩ DCs in the pooled LNs of ϩ/ϩ mice was 24.5 Ϯ 4.7 ϫ 10 3 per mouse compared with 9.1 Ϯ 2.4 ϫ 10 3 in plt mice (P Ͻ 0.01, n ϭ 3). Immunohistochemistry established that this decrease was most pronounced in the deep cortex. Those DCs that were present in plt mice typically clustered in the internodular cortex (Fig. 3, A and B ). In the spleens of plt mice, the total number of DCs was normal (Fig. 2 B) , but there was a striking abnormality in cell distribution (Fig. 3) . Staining with anti-CD11c revealed a marked decrease in the number of DCs within the white pulp (Fig. 3 , C and D). There was a concomitant increase in the number of DCs located outside the white pulp, either in bridging channels or in isolated clusters within the red pulp, such that the total number of splenic DCs remained normal. Staining with NLDC-145, which in the spleen is specific for interdigitating DCs (34) , also revealed a decrease in the number of these cells within the white pulp and demonstrated that those DCs outside the white pulp were NLDC-145 negative (Fig. 3, E and F) .
Decreased Migration of DCs into T Cell Zones of plt Mice. Interdigitating DCs in the T cell zones of LNs arise from DCs in the periphery which migrate to this area via the lymph after activation. To determine if the paucity of interdigitating cells observed in plt mice was due to a defect in the migration of DCs to LNs, we examined this migration after contact sensitization. 24 h after skin painting with 2 mg FITC, the frequency of FITC ϩ cells in the draining LNs of plt mice was markedly reduced compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 4 A) . The identity of these cells as DCs was confirmed by their characteristic forward and side scatter profiles, their staining with anti-CD11c (Fig. 4 B) and anti-I-A (Fig. 4 C) , and their low buoyant density. A comparison of eight FITC-painted plt mice with controls at 24 h revealed a 75% decrease in the number of FITC ϩ DCs in draining LNs (Fig. 4 D) . To ensure that the FITC signal in draining LNs was due to the migration of DCs rather than FITC accumulation within the LNs, we performed unilateral contact sensitization with low dose (0.2 mg) FITC and compared contralat-eral and draining LNs. In this procedure, resident (FITC Ϫ ) DCs can be distinguished from newly migrated (FITC ϩ ) DCs (35) . 24 h after skin painting, contralateral and draining LNs contained similar numbers of FITC Ϫ DCs in both ϩ/ϩ and plt mice (Fig. 4 E) . Similar to results shown above, the number of resident DCs was decreased 60% in plt mice. The draining LNs of painted mice demonstrated accumulation of FITC ϩ I-A ϩ cells. In plt mice, the number of these newly migrated FITC ϩ DCs was decreased 73% compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (29.5 Ϯ 11 ϫ 10 3 vs. 8.1 Ϯ 5.7 ϫ 10 3 , P ϭ 0.011, n ϭ 5).
To determine if the decreased accumulation of DCs in the LNs of plt mice was secondary to a decreased number of resident skin DCs, abdominal epidermis of ϩ/ϩ and plt mice was stained with anti-I-A (Fig. 5, A and B) . There was no significant difference in the density, morphology, or distribution of I-A ϩ DCs in the epidermis of untreated plt and ϩ/ϩ mice. The average number of I-A ϩ epidermal cells in ϩ/ϩ mice was 14 Ϯ 2.1 per high power field (HPF) compared with 15.5 Ϯ 2.8 in plt mice.
We also examined the migration of splenic DCs upon activation. Mouse spleen normally contains a population of interdigitating DCs located within the T cell zone and a separate population of DCs located in marginal zone bridg- ing channels and red pulp (30, 36, 37) . Treatment of mice with LPS has been shown to cause a rapid decrease in the number of DCs located in bridging channels and red pulp and a simultaneous increase in the number of interdigitating DCs (38) . This has led to the hypothesis that splenic DCs outside the T cell zone represent an immature population that migrates to the T cell zone upon activation. 6 h after intraperitoneal injection of LPS, spleens of ϩ/ϩ mice demonstrated intense staining of DCs within T cell zones but few DCs in bridging channels or red pulp (Fig. 5 C) . By contrast, the number of interdigitating cells in the splenic T cell zones of plt mice did not increase after LPS treatment. Most DCs remained scattered throughout the red pulp (Fig. 5 D) .
Normal DC Migration out of Epidermis in plt Mice. SLC is expressed (and therefore has the potential to mediate DC migration) at two points along the migration route of DCs from skin to LNs: in lymphatic endothelium and within the T cell zone. To determine if plt mice have a defect in the peripheral mobilization of DCs, we examined the migration of DCs out of cultured skin. Similar to our findings in abdominal epidermis, dorsal ear epidermis from plt mice contains a normal number of DCs (Fig. 6 E) . When segments of dorsal ear skin were placed in culture, the number of DCs within the epidermis of ϩ/ϩ and plt mice decreased to a similar extent over 72 h (Fig. 6, A, B , and E). Over the same time period, the number of DCs within the dermis increased similarly in plt and ϩ/ϩ mice (not shown). As described previously (31) , migrating DCs formed cords within the dermal lymphatics of ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 6 C) . A similar formation of cords was seen in plt mice (Fig. 6 D) , demonstrating that the plt mutation does not inhibit the entry of DCs into lymphatics. When the cells migrating out of dorsal ear skin were collected over 72 h and counted, the number of DCs released from the skin of plt and ϩ/ϩ mice was similar (Fig. 6 F) .
Decreased Expression of ELC in plt Mice. ELC is the chemokine most closely related to SLC. ELC and SLC have similar activities; both activate the CCR7 receptor, and their genes are located within 100 kb of each other in the human genome (24, 39, 40) . In contrast to SLC, ELC expression is limited to interdigitating DCs in LNs and spleen (41) . To determine if the decreased accumulation of DCs in plt mice leads to a decrease in the production of ELC, we examined ELC expression in plt mice. By Northern analysis, ELC mRNA levels in the LNs and spleen of plt mice were reduced compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 7 E) . By in situ hybridization, ELC expression was reduced in the LNs of plt mice compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 7, A  and B) . ELC antisense probes hybridized most strongly to the outer LN cortex in a region corresponding to the area in which DCs accumulated in plt mice (compare Fig. 7 B  and Fig. 3 B) . In the spleens of plt mice, ELC expression was also reduced (Fig. 7, C and D) . As in LNs, the hybridization signal in plt spleen localized to regions that correspond to the area in which DCs accumulated (compare Fig.  7 D and Fig. 3 D) . Similar to results in ϩ/ϩ mice, no ELC signal was detected in lymphatics or any nonlymphoid tissue of plt mice (data not shown).
plt Mice Have Decreased Resistance to Viral Infection. The entry of lymphocytes and DCs into T cell zones is likely to be a critical step in the development of a primary immune response. Because plt mice have defects in lymphocyte and DC migration, they are predicted to be deficient in mounting such a response. To evaluate the response of plt mice to viral infection, these mice were infected with MHV administered by intraperitoneal injection. plt mice demonstrate a markedly enhanced sensitivity to viral infection (Fig. 8) . At a dose of 20 PFU, which causes no mortality in wild-type mice, 80% of the infected plt mice died. The LD 50 for MHV in wild-type mice was calculated to be 1,840 PFU. In plt mice the LD 50 for MHV was 5.67 PFU, a 300-fold decrease.
SLC Introns and Exons Are Intact in plt Mice. Although the plt mutation (29) and the SLC gene (Gunn, M.D., un- published data) map to the same genetic locus on mouse chromosome 4, the molecular basis of the plt mutation has not been identified. To identify the genetic abnormality that leads to a loss of SLC expression in plt mice, we have initiated a search for the plt mutation at the DNA level. The murine SLC gene contains four exons spanning a total of 1 kb (Gunn, M.D., unpublished data). To determine if the plt mutation occurs within SLC introns or exons, overlapping PCR fragments were generated from genomic DNA of both plt and ϩ/ϩ mice. Comparison of plt and ϩ/ϩ sequence over a 3-kb region extending from 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site to 1 kb downstream of the polyadenylation signal revealed several single base changes but no mutation that would account for a loss of SLC expression (data not shown). Thus, while the plt mutation is located in the proximity of the SLC gene, it is not within SLC introns or exons.
Chemokines are implicated in two distinct steps in lymphocyte extravasation. First, they can stimulate integrin activation and the firm adhesion of rolling lymphocytes. Second, they can provide a chemotactic signal for lymphocyte migration through the endothelium and into the underlying tissue. We believe that SLC is the chemokine that mediates the first of these steps during the homing of naive T cells to LNs and PPs. Evidence in support of this conclusion includes the expression of SLC on HEVs, the ability of SLC to activate both ␣ L ␤ 2 and ␣ 4 ␤ 7 integrins on T cells, the ability of SLC to stimulate the rapid arrest of rolling T cells with an efficiency similar to that seen in vivo, and the absence of any other known chemokine with similar characteristics. We now add to this body of evidence by demonstrating that mice homozygous for the plt mutation do not express SLC (Fig. 1) . The lymphocyte homing defect in plt mice is similar to that seen when naive T cells are treated with pertussis toxin-failure of naive T cells to enter LNs, PPs, or the white pulp of spleen, suggesting that the defect in plt mice occurs in the initial steps of lympho-cyte extravasation (29, 42, 43) . Like pertussis toxin treatment, the lymphocyte homing defect in plt mice probably represents a loss of the signal for the integrin-mediated firm adhesion of naive T cells.
Although the molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated, naive lymphocytes are believed to enter the white pulp of spleen by a series of adhesive and chemotactic steps similar to those that occur in LNs. The lack of T cells in the white pulp of spleen in plt mice suggests that SLC is also required for the entry of naive T cells into the T cell zones of spleen. By analogy with the defect seen in LNs, it is plausible that SLC provides the stimulus for an integrin activation step that is required for movement of naive T cells into the white pulp of spleen. SLC may also provide a chemotactic stimulus that guides naive T cells into the T cell zones of LNs and spleen. However, this function is unlikely to be unique, as other lymphocyte-specific chemokines such as ELC and DCCK1 are expressed in T cell zones (41, 44) . ELC has been shown to be more potent than SLC against naive T cells, and therefore may predominate in providing a chemotactic stimulus within the T cell zone (39) .
The involvement of SLC in naive lymphocyte homing was initially suggested by its expression on HEVs (23) . Similarly, the expression of SLC at sites such as lymphatic endothelium suggested to us that SLC may be involved in other leukocyte trafficking events and that plt mice may have other leukocyte trafficking defects. We now find that plt mice have a defect in the migration of DCs into the T cell zones of lymphoid organs. Four lines of evidence support this finding. First, the number of DCs in the T cell zones of LNs and spleen in plt mice is decreased (Fig. 3) . In the spleen, this decrease occurs despite a normal total number of splenic DCs (Fig. 2) . Second, DCs appear to accumulate at the periphery of T cell zones in both LNs and spleen of plt mice (Fig. 3) . The pattern of this accumulation is consistent with a block in the entry of DCs into T cell zones. Third, we directly demonstrate a decrease in the migration of FITC-activated DCs to draining LNs of plt mice (Fig. 4) . It is possible that this defect in DC migration is secondary to the paucity of T cells in the LNs of plt mice. However, in both L-selectin knockout mice, which have a defect in the homing of naive lymphocytes to LNs similar to that of plt mice, and nude mice, which lack mature T cells, FITC-stimulated migration of DCs to LNs is normal (12, 35, 45, 46) . This suggests that DC migration to LNs is not lymphocyte dependent. Fourth, splenic DCs in the bridging channels and red pulp of plt mice fail to redistribute to the T cell zone upon activation with LPS (Fig. 5, C and D) . Taken together, these results suggest that plt mice lack a factor that acts directly on DCs to stimulate their migration. Due to its lack of expression, the probable identity of this factor is SLC.
Because SLC is expressed in lymphatic endothelium, we examined the possibility that the defect in DC migration from skin to LNs in plt mice is due to an inability of activated DCs to enter afferent lymphatics. Our findings argue against this possibility, as DCs in skin cultured from plt mice were able to migrate normally out of the epidermis, collect in lymphatics, and move out of the skin in normal numbers (Fig. 6 ). Although these results do not rule out the existence of a subtle defect in the mobilization of peripheral DCs, they suggest that the DC homing defect in plt mice occurs at the level of DC entry into T cell zones. At present, the function of SLC in lymphatic endothelium remains unknown.
Additional support for our conclusion that SLC is involved in DC homing to T cell zones comes from recent studies of chemokine receptor expression by DCs in vitro (47) (48) (49) . DCs derived in culture from monocytes or CD34 ϩ precursors do not express CCR7, the receptor for SLC and ELC. CCR7 expression is induced in these cells by activation with LPS, CD40 ligand, or TNF. Similarly, activated DCs increase intracellular calcium and undergo chemotaxis in response to ELC. These results suggest that immature DCs become responsive to SLC and ELC upon activation in vivo and that one or both of these chemokines is involved in the migration of activated DCs. It has been suggested that it is the activation-induced downregulation of chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR5, and CCR6 that allows DCs to leave sites of inflammation, whereas the more gradual induction of CCR7 on these cells allows them to enter T cell zones in response to ELC (47, 48) . Our results support this hypothesis, though we would suggest that SLC, rather than ELC, may play the predominant role.
Finally, we demonstrate that plt mice have a severe immune deficiency. The LD 50 of MHV in plt mice is reduced Ͼ300-fold compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 8) . In comparison, the LD 50 of Sendai virus is reduced 10-fold in mice lacking cytotoxic T cell function and 300-fold in nude mice compared with ϩ/ϩ controls (50) . In our view, the most likely cause of this immune deficiency is a defect in the presentation of viral antigen due to the failure of naive T cells and antigen-bearing DCs to enter the T cell zones of plt mice. It is also possible that SLC, like some other chemokines, provides a signal that enhances the antigendependent activation of lymphocytes (51, 52) . A third possibility is that SLC, expressed in the thymus and in lymphatics, has a role in lymphocyte development or in the efferent limb of immune response that has not yet been characterized.
In this study, we cannot fully distinguish the biological effects of SLC from those of ELC. Because SLC and ELC signal through the same receptor, some of their functions may overlap. plt mice express no detectable SLC mRNA while ELC mRNA expression is only partially reduced ( Figs. 1 and 7) , and the abnormalities observed in plt mice are likely to be due to the sum of these defects. Still, some conclusions can be drawn from our results. The near-total loss of naive T cell homing in plt mice suggests an absolute requirement for SLC and the existence of at least one function that cannot be performed by ELC. In contrast, plt mice appear to exhibit only a partial defect in DC migration, suggesting that SLC and ELC may both contribute to this process and that some DCs reach the T cell zone of plt mice in response to low levels of ELC.
While we suggest that SLC is required for the normal homing of naive T cells and DCs to secondary lymphoid organs, we would emphasize that our findings do not constitute proof of this hypothesis. It is possible that the plt mutation directly affects the expression of a gene other than SLC or ELC which is responsible for some of the phenotypic abnormalities observed in plt mice. Although the plt mutation maps to the same genetic locus as SLC and plt mice express no detectable SLC, no DNA abnormality has been identified in these mice. Based on mapping data, the distance between the plt mutation and the SLC gene is between 1 and 1,000 kb. Given their normal SLC intron and exon sequences, we believe that the most likely cause of the lack of SLC expression in plt mice is a mutation involving a cis-acting regulatory region of the SLC gene. Such regions do not have to be in the immediate vicinity of the genes they regulate. For example, the deletion of a region 50 kb upstream of the human ␤-globin gene leads to a loss of its expression (53) . Because the plt mutation may involve a large deletion in the vicinity of the SLC gene, we cannot rule out the possibility that this defect involves more than one gene.
Despite this uncertainty, our working hypothesis continues to be that the genetic defect in plt mice represents a sin-gle-gene null mutation of SLC. Thus far, all of the recognized abnormalities in plt mice occur in areas of SLC expression and involve cell types known to be responsive to SLC. This may change, as we are currently examining the phenotype of plt mice in more detail while attempting to identify the DNA abnormality responsible for the plt mutation. At present, however, our findings strongly suggest that SLC mediates the homing of both naive T cells and DCs to secondary lymphoid organs and that the abnormalities in plt mice are due to a genetic defect in the expression of SLC.",Mice Lacking Expression of Secondary Lymphoid Organ Chemokine Have Defects in Lymphocyte Homing and Dendritic Cell Localization,"Gunn, Michael D.; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Tam, Carmen; Kakiuchi, Terutaka; Matsuzawa, Akio; Williams, Lewis T.; Nakano, Hideki",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2192914/,193,5608,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,f6e985e472df7bba7a7ef1568336c0443b919639,"Viruses are widely used as vectors for heterologous gene expression in cultured cells or natural hosts, and therefore a large number of viruses with exogenous sequences inserted into their genomes have been engineered. Many of these engineered viruses are viable and express heterologous proteins at high levels, but the inserted sequences often prove to be unstable over time and are rapidly lost, limiting heterologous protein expression. Although virologists are aware that inserted sequences can be unstable, processes leading to insert instability are rarely considered from an evolutionary perspective. Here, we review experimental work on the stability of inserted sequences over a broad range of viruses, and we present some theoretical considerations concerning insert stability. Different virus genome organizations strongly impact insert stability, and factors such as the position of insertion can have a strong effect. In addition, we argue that insert stability not only depends on the characteristics of a particular genome, but that it will also depend on the host environment and the demography of a virus population. The interplay between all factors affecting stability is complex, which makes it challenging to develop a general model to predict the stability of genomic insertions. We highlight key questions and future directions, finding that insert stability is a surprisingly complex problem and that there is need for mechanism-based, predictive models. Combining theoretical models with experimental tests for stability under varying conditions can lead to improved engineering of viral modified genomes, which is a valuable tool for understanding genome evolution as well as for biotechnological applications, such as gene therapy.",,On the stability of sequences inserted into viral genomes,"Willemsen, Anouk; Zwart, Mark P",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6855363/,258,10551,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
114,deea74c59b21622d228c43adea5340e8a2447081,"Systems vaccinology has proven a fascinating development in the last decade. Where traditionally vaccine development has been dominated by trial and error, systems vaccinology is a tool that provides novel and comprehensive understanding if properly used. Data sets retrieved from systemsbased studies endorse rational design and effective development of safe and efficacious vaccines. In this review we first describe different omicstechniques that form the pillars of systems vaccinology. In the second part, the application of systems vaccinology in the different stages of vaccine development is described. Overall, this review shows that systems vaccinology has become an important tool anywhere in the vaccine development chain.","There are many effective vaccines available to protect humans against infectious diseases. However, the development of vaccines against 'difficult' pathogens remains challenging. For example, vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are still under development. Furthermore, some existing vaccines require improved efficacy, e.g. vaccines against Bordetella pertussis, influenza viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium species causing malaria. In addition, new infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease will continue to emerge, which require new vaccines to prevent epidemics. Also, therapeutic vaccines against noninfectious diseases, such as cancer, are needed. The lack of in-depth knowledge of the pathogen and requirements for protective immunity often hamper development. 1 Application of systems biology during the development of vaccines, or systems vaccinology, can be an important tool to enhance insight into immune responses induced by (candidate) vaccines or identification of (early) correlates of protection. 2,3 Alan Aderem defined systems biology as a 'comprehensive quantitative analysis of the manner in which all the components of a biological system interact functionally over time and space that is executed by an interdisciplinary team of investigators.' 4 This definition can readily be applied to study the responses to vaccination. Systems-based approaches are often labeled unbiased and broad (sometimes even the word 'holistic' is used). However, that is only true to a certain extent, as defining a research objective is already introducing bias. Often only a few analytical techniques are used (as described in the next section) to address the objectives (Fig. 1) . Usually, there are also limitations in availability of materials. For example, in preclinical studies using mice the amount of blood that can be collected is very limited, whereas in clinical studies mainly body fluids can be used, although biopsies and mucosal lavages are sometimes available. Also, time is an essential parameter of systems vaccinology for studying kinetics and cause-effect relations, but repeated sampling is limited in humans. In this review, we describe current developments of the techniques that form the pillars of systems vaccinology and discuss the implementation of systems vaccinology in the vaccine research and development chain.
Twenty years ago, Rino Rappuoli and co-workers introduced reverse vaccinology, a genome-based method to identify new leads with strong antibody responses. 5 However, the role of immunogens is currently studied in conjunction with other factors, such as adjuvants and antigen delivery, as these influence immune responses and induction of immunological memory that are key for vaccine This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.
efficacy. Systems vaccinology addresses these aspects in order to understand why some vaccines function properly whereas other vaccines do not. In this section, the most important and widely used techniques applied in different levels of systems vaccinology are described. An overview of these techniques and applications thereof that are used for the systems vaccinology-based approach, are listed in Table 1 . 
For decades, RNA analysis has been applied to study vaccine-induced responses 6 and has evolved from (quantitative) polymerase chain reaction to high-throughput methods like microarrays and next-generation sequencing (RNAseq). The applications range from assessing transcriptional profiles in whole tissues and blood to purified cell populations 7, 8 and, more recently, even single cells. 9, 10 In contrast to conventional transcriptome analysis that results in loss of tissue or cells, transcriptome in vivo analysis allows us to monitor mRNA expression in situ in live cells or animals. 11 Transcriptomics of the complete genome is unbiased, relatively straightforward and is offered as a service by many contract laboratories. Gene expression levels and kinetics provide information on involvement of genes following immunization. [12] [13] [14] [15] However, mRNA is often not an effector molecule in itself, but needs translation into protein and mRNA levels often do not correlate with protein content. One study reported that in mice, under those conditions, only 27% of the mRNA transcript correlates with protein expression. 16 To that end, transcriptomic profiling in vaccine research serves as an excellent tool to find potential markers of vaccineinduced responses that subsequently need to be confirmed on protein or cellular level. Novel methods such as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) try to overcome this translational challenge by combining in parallel the targeting of single cells with protein markers with unbiased transcriptome profiling to obtain more specific information on gene expression in cellular phenotypes than RNA-seq in the complete tissue. 17 In addition to mRNA profiles, investigating the role of noncoding microRNAs becomes relevant given their role in immunology. 18 
Contrary to the transcriptome, the proteome encompasses the effectors that exert and control the immune response.
Receptors, ligands, enzymes, hormones and even structural proteins detect foreign substances, determine the identity of cells and communicate messages between cells and tissues. Profiling the subset of proteins and peptides involved in the immune response (termed immunoproteomics) 19 is important to understand how vaccines work. During the last three decades, mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomics has emerged as an essential tool to profile this immunoproteome in terms of protein identification, protein dynamics and protein-protein interactions. Hunt et al. 20 pioneered the MS-based analysis of immunogenic peptides presented by molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Since then, many studies have profiled the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) ligand repertoire using immunoprecipitation techniques and subsequent MS-based ligand identification to find new antigen leads and to understand the concept of immunogenicity. Apart from targeting infectious diseases, [21] [22] [23] [24] MHC ligandome analysis also is applied in, for example, cancer immunotherapy. 25 Recent studies, however, have shown that the plethora of MHC-presented peptides is even more complex than expected, due to the formation of non-linear peptide sequences (i.e. splicing variants) of these T-cell epitopes as it is estimated that one-third of the CD8 + T-cell epitopes is comprised of proteasome-generated spliced epitopes. [26] [27] [28] [29] In addition to profiling the T-cell epitope repertoire, assessing the antigenic determinants that interact with B-cells and antibodies is of high significance in elucidating immune responses in vaccine development and vaccine design. [30] [31] [32] Since B-cell epitopes are often conformational or even discontinuous, their identification is complex and currently not possible using in silico tools. With instrumental improvement of MS and the supporting software tools, MS is now used as a versatile tool to determine B-cell epitopes, that is, the areas where antibodies bind. Opuni et al. 33 comprehensively reviewed MS-based approaches to map B-cell epitopes. Antibody-antigen binding is just one example of a protein-protein interaction. Large-scale interaction analysis (interactomics) is rapidly developing to identify any type of protein-protein interaction.
A new class of MS-cleavable cross-linking reagents has a great potential in interactomics. [34] [35] [36] Like all other cross-linking reagents, these compounds stabilize transient protein-protein interactions by the formation of covalent bonds under physiological conditions. But they also allow for the unambiguous identification of the spatially distributed peptides of the interacting proteins, based on the presence of characteristic reporter ions in the mass spectra that are representative for intramolecular or intermolecular cross-links. Liu et al. showed a good correlation between protein three-dimensional-structure data obtained from chemical cross-linking MS (XL-MS) using MS-cleavable reagents and data from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on purified protein assemblies. In addition, they also identified in HeLa cell lysates crosslinks from protein domains lacking X-ray or cryo-EM three-dimensional-structure data, 37 illustrating the great potential of this strategy in identifying protein-protein interactions. To detect protein-protein interactions by XL-MS, it is mandatory that the amino acids in the interaction area are reactive with the cross-linker.
Secreted proteins play an essential role in communication between immune cells. The immune secretome consists of a wide range of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factors, interferons and interleukins. Multiplex immunoassays and ELISA methods target predefined proteins from the secretome, based on cytokine-specific antibodies. In contrast, newly developed MS-based proteomics methods like BioOrthogonal Non-Canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT) can target the full repertoire of secreted proteins, although limited to in vitro experiments only. In a BONCAT assay, an amino acid is replaced by an azido-containing analogue (e.g. methionine replacement by azidohomoalanine). The azido moiety allows for purification of excreted, low abundance, newly synthesized proteins from cell culture medium by click- chemistry using alkyne-functionalized beads. 38, 39 The amino acid modification does not affect the structure and function of the protein, nor does it alter the protein synthesis rate or cell viability. 40, 41 In combination with multiplexing technologies based on Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT), N,N-dimethyl leucine (DiLeu) tagging or neutron-encoded reagents, up to 25 samples can be multiplexed in a single run, for unbiased identification and relative quantification of de novo-synthesized proteins in the secretome. 42, 43 Limitations of MS-based proteomics lay in the fact that, like transcriptomics, it is dependent on the availability and quality of annotated protein databases, e.g. number of annotated genes or proteins. The sensitivity of the current generation of mass spectrometers is high, but could improve further to reach the levels achieved with, for example, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. However, as described here and by others, 44 MS is currently very useful for the characterization of a wide range of immunological mechanisms in the context of infection and vaccination.
The Systems Vaccinology approach is not limited to the common application of transcriptomics and proteomics and novel techniques and applications are more often applied (Table 1) . For example, metabolomics is a highthroughput technology to study metabolic pathways in biological systems. The metabolome covers all small molecules and intermediates (usually < 2000 dalton (Da) molecular weight) that are highly dynamic in the catabolic and anabolic processes of cells. In many immunological studies, metabolomics is now an integral part of system vaccinology, to predict biomarkers and to evaluate vaccine efficacy. 45, 46 Untargeted metabolome analysis requires many different sample preparation procedures and analytical tools to identify all metabolites. Gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, MS, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance are frequently used or combined to study the metabolome, although with limited precision and accuracy. Improved accuracy, precision and specificity of these assays can be obtained by using semi-targeted or targeted metabolomics strategies if the chemical identities of the analytes are known beforehand. 47 
In the context of systems vaccinology, conventional assays that are neither high throughput, nor unbiased, remain necessary to confirm hypotheses. Histology is still the common method to confirm the influx and the location of immune cells in tissues as a result of an infection or immunization. However, visualization of cells in tissue sections continually improves by better immunoimaging techniques 48 such as confocal microscopy. Ex vivo, assays such as ELISA and flow cytometry are applied to identify and quantify specific cell subsets as well as their activation state and function (such as cytokine production or proliferation). These immunological techniques for studying these responses have also become more powerful. Flow cytometry equipment has improved, for example, by combining the measurement of the amount of proteins per cell (flow cytometry), with visualization of their localization within the cells (microscopy), so-called imaging flow cytometry. 49 Also, more fluorescent labels have become available, increasing the number of markers that can be investigated simultaneously. Multi-parameter flow cytometry enables the identification of these specialized, often rare, subsets of cells. 50 For example, innate cells that play a crucial role in pathogen recognition and in influencing the magnitude and direction of adaptive immunity, such as specific subtypes of antigen-presenting cells and innate lymphoid cells. With respect to adaptive immune responses, the ability to identify rare subsets mainly focuses on antigen-specific B-cells 51 and T-cells, 52 both circulating and tissue-resident cells, and precursors as well as effector and memory cells. 7, 8 Cytometry by Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF) 53 uses raremetal isotopes instead of fluorescent labels for labeling, thereby almost abolishing the spectral overlap seen with fluorescent dyes and expanding the number markers that can be measured simultaneously even further. For example, Van Unen et al. 54 identified 142 immune subsets in the human mucosal immune system.
In addition, the opportunity of sorting specific subsets of cells not only as a population, but also as single cells, in combination with high-throughput analysis of the isolated cells, added yet another dimension. Lymphocyte epitope specificity necessarily is extremely diverse to fight the wide array of possible pathogens and is accomplished by randomness through several recombinatorial events and additional random changes during lymphocyte ontogeny. For example, the number of different antibodies human B-cells can produce, outnumbers the B lymphocytes (~10 11 ) in the human body. 55 High-throughput single-cell analysis enabled detailed interrogation of these broad B-cell and T-cell repertoires. 56 These techniques also revealed that priming might not always be predictive, as preferential expansion of B-cells and T-cells also plays an important role. 57 This illustrates that enhanced understanding of lymphocyte responses not only leads to identification of novel early markers for efficacy of vaccines, but is also useful for their evaluation. Hypotheses with respect to B-cell and T-cell epitopes can be derived from MS-based studies as described in the former paragraph. Moreover, current knowledge with respect to HLA specificity has also enabled the prediction of T-cell epitopes in silico, decreasing the time needed for analysis. 58 As B-cell epitopes are often conformational, current knowledge does not yet enable in silico predictions to the same extent as for T-cells. For B-cell epitope analysis of complex multi-protein vaccines, antibody-antigen binding can be investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with Western blotting to pinpoint immunogenic antigens. 59 Subsequently, peptide arrays can be applied to investigating the immunodominant epitopes of these discovered antigens. 60 The ability to isolate single antibody-producing B-cells and subsequent DNA sequencing of immunoglobulin genes in high-throughput settings (Ig-seq) has greatly impacted the depth of understanding with respect to the antibody repertoire. 55 Single-cell sorting in combination with B-cell cloning has enabled the isolation of specific antibodies able to neutralize pathogens, including rare antigens with characteristics that are of special interest, such as antibodies that are broadly cross-reactive among highly variable viruses by binding to conserved regions. This was, for example, found for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes upon infection as well as vaccination. [61] [62] [63] [64] In general, this has shifted the focus from the most immunogenic epitopes to the more conserved regions. However, it has proved challenging to design vaccines that induce strong responses against these regions. Challenges with respect to design of vaccines inducing such broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV and influenza virus were extensively reviewed by Corti and Lanzavecchia. 65 For example, other regions might need to be removed or deimmunized and the conserved epitopes might not be easily accessible, preventing the vaccine-induced antibodies from binding to the natural target. Another point of attention is that a focus on increased immunogenicity should not lead to a decrease in safety. For example, antibodies with long or charged CDR-H3 regions enable binding to occluded sites on pathogens and mediate pathogen neutralization but are also more likely to be autoreactive. 55 IgG antibody levels have served as correlates of protection for traditional vaccines, 66 but in the context of systems vaccinology, not only antibody quantity, but also functionality is increasingly investigated. Antibodies may inhibit other functional antibodies or enhance disease by facilitating virus entry into cells. However, non-neutralizing antibodies may still be functional and could have more impact on protection from disease than neutralizing antibodies, for instance by interaction of the antibody constant domain with Fc receptors. This interaction is determined by two characteristics, antibody subclass (irreversible) and antibody glycosylation (fast and reversible) that can for example impact the affinity for Fc receptors. 67 The glycosylation profile of antigen-specific antibodies is changed upon vaccination, whereas the glycosylation profile of total IgG is not affected. Interestingly, despite very different pre-vaccination glycosylation levels in populations in different parts of the world, 68 profiles induced by vaccination are similar, as was shown after influenza vaccination. 69 However, different vaccine formulations can induce different glycosylation profiles. 68 This is likely also influenced by the adjuvant present in the formulation, either directly or via cytokine induction. 70 Though the biological implications of these differences are not yet clear, the recent developments in systems serology demonstrate that multiple parameters of the antibody response, such as IgG subtype and antibody glycosylation among others, influence antibody functionally and therefore vaccine efficacy. [71] [72] [73] 
One of the difficulties in systems approaches is the amount of data. Statistical evaluation, visualization and extracting meaningful conclusions are major challenges and require multiple tools and expertises. 74, 75 New technologies in systems vaccinology such as metabolomics may require different statistical and bioinformatic analysis strategies compared with transcriptomics and proteomics data sets, as described by Ren et al. 76 Visualization of data from full genomes or proteomes was initially performed with tools applying e.g. heatmaps, Venn diagrams and network analysis, e.g. with Cytoscape. 77 These allowed visualization of numerous individual data points or groups, but also the clustering of related data points. Additionally, the generation of multiple systems-scale data sets enables the comparison of immune responses induced by different vaccines in an unbiased manner. 78, 79 Hierarchical Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (HSNE) enables us to visualize data of cellular composition of millions of cells in detail up to the single-cell level. 80 Although these graphs provide an easier perspective on trends in the data sets, they are not designed to provide information on the biological function of individual data points. The development of data mining tools ( Fig. 1 ) has given scientists a handle to translate their data sets into the description of relevant biological processes. 81 This allows for investigation of the involvement and mutual interaction of pathways, processes and cell types. Tools that are focused on pathway analysis include DAVID, 82 Pathway-Express, 83 Gene Onthology (GO) 84 and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). 85 With BioGPS, the involvement of cells or the different stages in cell activation can be investigated. 86 This has also led to the development of specialized databases for specific research topics. For example, InnateDB contains data on innate immune responses 87 while INTERFEROME focuses on interferon-related processes 88 and the CEMiTool can be used for co-expression analyses and discovery of functionality of genes. 89 For the discovery and analysis of the repertoire of T-and B-cell receptor sequences, VDJviz can be applied for the routine analysis and quality control of sequencing of immune repertoires 90 and VDJdb is designed for the annotation of T-cell receptor repertoire data. 91 These databases evolve and expand continuously based on novel data, scientific insights and technologies. Depending on the choice of data mining tools, the outcome of results might differ. However, within the Human Vaccines Project, 92 researchers demonstrated that there was no difference in the outcome of their data when it was either analyzed using a tool based on prior knowledge, in this case the NetAnalyst platform, or with an unbiased tool, DIABLO.
In addition, to generate knowledge and understanding, large data sets are used in computational systems biology studies to predict host immune responses. 75, 93 From the antigen point of view, machine-learning tools are widely applied to predict B-cell 94 and T-cell epitopes 95 and novel tools such as the IL17eScan 96 enable us to predict the capacity of epitopes to induce interleukin-17. All these data can be gathered in silico prior to or simultaneous with laboratory studies to confirm the role of host biomarkers and antigen epitopes in vaccine responses.
In each phase of vaccine development (Fig. 2) , systems vaccinology techniques can be applied to improve the quality of the vaccine development process as well as decreasing the risk of late-stage failure as a result of increased knowledge (Table 2) . Apart from host-vaccine responses, a systems approach can also provide essential information on the vaccine itself, more specifically the antigen composition. Most vaccines belong to one of four groups: (i) live-attenuated, (ii) whole inactivated, (iii) subunit and (iv) conjugate vaccines. Detailed vaccine characterization is mainly of interest for complex multi-protein vaccines such as live-attenuated and inactivated (bacterial) vaccines if for instance batch consistency must be proven.
During the discovery phase a systems approach can be implemented to investigate vaccine composition as is especially interesting for complex multi-protein vaccines (Fig. 2) . For example, transcriptomics and/or proteomics approaches can be applied during strain generation for an inactivated vaccine to provide detailed information on protein composition and, more specifically, the proportion of immunogenic proteins. These techniques can subsequently be used for process development to verify whether or not the product is similar when produced at a larger scale. This was, for instance, demonstrated for pertussis whole-cell vaccines. 97 Information on the relationship between cultivation conditions and the composition of the final vaccine, considerably enhances the process of optimizing vaccine efficacy. In addition, it reveals key process parameters that can subsequently be tightly monitored, making the process more consistent and thereby eventual vaccine release easier.
To study the vaccine responses in the discovery phase, systems vaccinology methods can be used to study the mechanism of action of vaccines or adjuvants, both in vitro as well as in experimental animals (Fig. 2) . In vitro cell-based assays allow the gain of information on the magnitude and direction of the innate response, but they lack the possibility to study coherent interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses. Especially in the transition from innate to adaptive responses, a lot of immunological information is still missing.
While the main focus in systems vaccinology is on vaccine-induced responses, pathogen-induced responses during infection are also of great interest, as these can enable the discovery of potential markers of, or mechanisms involved in, protective immunity, or unwanted immunological effects such as immune evasion (Fig. 2) . Systems biology can assist to investigate host-pathogen interactions by looking at pathogen behavior and clearance after infection. A natural infection sometimes induces effective protection, e.g. mumps, that may serve as a benchmark for a vaccine, whereas other pathogens may display immune evasive or suppressive responses, which one would like to avoid in a vaccine-induced response. A systems-based approach was for instance used to investigate infection-induced responses during sepsis. 98 In terms of vaccine-preventable diseases, investigators have looked at infection-induced responses for pathogens such as RSV, [99] [100] [101] M. tuberculosis, 102 B. pertussis 12,78,103 and influenza. 104, 105 The course of a B. pertussis infection was investigated in mice to unravel molecular and cellular signatures of the effective infection-induced immunity. 12, 106 Results indicated that a B. pertussis infection induced T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and mucosal IgA responses that were preceded by a prolonged acute-phase response, broad pathogen recognition and early gene signatures of subsequent T-cell recruitment in the lungs. 12 In addition, the infection led to enhanced activation of pulmonary innate immune cells and markers indicating recruitment of CCR6 + B-cells and Th17 cells. 106 These promising markers of infection-induced responses should ideally be confirmed in human B. pertussis challenge models. 107 In a comparative network analysis of two data sets, the pulmonary molecular signatures that preceded the effector cells in B. pertussis infection-induced-immunity 12 were compared with signatures induced upon pulmonary immunization with a novel Outer Membrane Vesicle Pertussis vaccine (omvPV). 15 Network analysis demonstrated that similar genes and pathways were involved in both responses but that the intensity and kinetics between infection-induced and vaccine-induced responses were different. Both responses did, however, result in induction Systems approaches have also been used to investigate innate responses, for example responses induced by adjuvants. 108 In vitro studies were performed to investigate monocyte-specific responses induced by alum salts using a proteomics approach 109 and to study subset-specific dendritic cell responses following lipopolysaccharide stimulation using a transcriptomics approach. 110 These extensive in vitro studies provide insight into novel markers, pathways and cell subsets activated by adjuvants. Yet the complexity of cell-to-cell interaction during immune Relevant animal models to study infection are not always available. In such cases, the application of systems approaches in vaccination studies can provide valuable information on the mechanism of action of candidate vaccines. G omez et al. unraveled transcriptomic activation markers of human myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells upon stimulation with a vaccine candidate against HIV/AIDS, based on an MVA-based vector. Subsequently, HIV-1-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell memory responses were demonstrated in vivo. 114 Strouts et al. 115 were able to link early specific gene transcripts related to T-cell activation and type I interferon response to the magnitude of neutralizing antibody titers after immunization with a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine in non-human primates. As part of the development of a novel Outer Membrane Vesicle Pertussis vaccine (omvPV), vaccineinduced responses were investigated in mice. An extensive proteomics approach for antibody profiling was used to determine the distinct antibody specificity and subclass distribution induced by different pertussis vaccines. 59 Transcriptome and cytokine profiling demonstrated reduced pro-inflammatory responses, potentially leading to less adverse effects by the omvPV compared with a classic whole-cell pertussis vaccine while maintaining the vaccine efficacy. 116 To investigate the effect of the route of immunization on protective immunity, the responses induced by subcutaneous and pulmonary administration of omvPV in mice were compared. 15 The study demonstrated improved mucosal immunity, and therefore protection, against B. pertussis after pulmonary immunization. Finally, in terms of vaccine safety, Mizukami et al. 117 applied the systems-approach in a rat model to predict safety and batch-to-batch consistency of influenza vaccines. Wang et al. 118 investigated blood gene signatures in non-human primates immunized with seven marketed or experimental vaccines to isolate markers of vaccine efficacy and safety. Whereas overlapping trends in markers of efficacy were found between some vaccines, no markers were found correlating to adverse effects.
Predictive markers that have been found in the exploratory studies (described in the previous section) can be applied in subsequent clinical studies. Moreover, systems vaccinology analyses are also useful in a clinical study itself to obtain better insight into safety and efficacy (Fig. 2) . However, to our knowledge in only a few clinical studies has systems vaccinology been performed to assess signatures that correlate to adverse effects, such as fever and seizures. In the public-private project BIOVACSAFE, systems approaches are applied to investigate markers correlating to vaccine safety in human and animal models potentially providing novel markers. 119 Investigators have conducted systems-based studies in humans investigating vaccine candidates against Ebola (rVSV-ZEBOV), 120 HIV-1, 121 malaria (RTS,S) 122, 123 and M. tuberculosis (M72/ AS01). 124 For Ebola (rVSV-ZEBOV), IP-10 and CXCR6 + natural killer (NK) cells were independently correlating with antibody titers, suggesting that IP-10 could be a potential target to influence vaccine-induced responses. 120 Anderson et al. 121 investigated transcriptome profiles in the blood of healthy volunteers following immunization with a novel HIV-1 vaccine adjuvanted with a Toll-like receptor 4 agonist. High responders, based on serum antibodies, contained modules of genes expressed in NK cells, whereas modules of genes related to myeloid cells, monocytes and integrin cell surface interactions were detected in low responders. These signatures enable vaccine responses to be distinguished in an early phase and perhaps even allows steering of immune responses in low responders by adjustment of the vaccine. In a phase I randomized controlled trial using AS03-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted inactivated split-virus H5N1 influenza vaccines, the effect of adjuvant on vaccine-induced responses, such as serum cytokines, antibody titers, and gene expression levels, was investigated. This led to novel insights into antigen processing, presentation markers in neutrophils and revealed the correlation of serum IP-10 levels with proliferation of NK cells. 125 Interestingly, for the prediction of protection induced by malaria (RTS,S) immunization, NK cells correlated negatively whereas positive correlations were detected for molecular signatures of B-cells and plasma cells 122 factor-jB and interferon-c pathways. 123 These findings indicate that different vaccine-adjuvant combinations may induce different immune (non)effective responses.
After vaccines have been licensed and introduced on the market, post-marketing surveillance studies are performed to monitor vaccine safety and efficacy in larger populations (Fig. 2) . At this point in the vaccine life cycle, correlates of protection, or surrogates thereof, are sometimes known, however the mechanism of action is often underexposed.

stems approaches in this phase are not routinely applied, as far as we know. The validation of the methods is complex and expensive, with the added value not yet proven convincingly. However, pioneering studies have demonstrated that vaccine efficacy after yellow fever and influenza vaccination could be predicted in an early stage after immunization by analyzing molecular signatures. 14,126, 127 For the yellow fever vaccine, the enhanced levels of specific gene expression profiles in blood obtained 1 to 7 days after vaccination were predictive for antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell levels and antibody titers usually obtained 60 days after immunization, thus inducing a significant time advantage. In a clinical phase, regulators might want to see positive classical end-points but for post-marketing purposes this approach of looking at early correlates may be valuable. Furthermore, these studies are of value in comparative studies of different vaccine formulations. Nakaya et al. 128 compared two different vaccine formulations, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV), in children and predicted influenza antibody titers 1 month after vaccination with a seasonal influenza vaccine across five consecutive seasons by analyzing specific signatures of innate immunity and plasma blasts. 129 In addition, a systems biology approach could also be applied to investigate the differences in vaccine responsiveness in different target groups. For example, researchers predicted age-related vaccine hypo-responses against a hepatitis B vaccine in the elderly with a gene marker 130 and exposed transcriptomic signatures of vaccine-induced immunity, both cellular and humoral immune responses, after seasonal influenza vaccination specifically in older adults. 131 Obviously, these post-marketing surveillance studies facilitate further clinical development of improved vaccines or provide insight into general mechanisms that will enhance future vaccine development, even if correlates of protection are unknown. 132 Finally, a great benefit of systems vaccinology studies is the ability to combine data sets from vaccine responses against different pathogens in integrative network modeling to reveal detailed insight into universal signatures of vaccine responsiveness. 78,79,118, 133 Li et al. 79 compared molecular signatures, induced by five different human vaccines against specific bacterial or viral infections, which could predict antibody responses. This indicates that investigating responses against a single pathogen can lead to universal markers that serve as benchmark for vaccine development against new emerging diseases. This also supports the desire for data obtained in systemsapproaches to be publicly available (open access) for future large meta-analyses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Systems vaccinology has been implemented in the different phases of the vaccine development chain and has become a relevant approach in the field of vaccinology. The recent progression in systems vaccinology has led to successful initiatives such as the ADITEC project 134 that provided a novel gene expression method to analyze biomarkers of tuberculosis pathogenesis 135 as well as a study where safety and immunogenicity of a novel vaccine against tuberculosis (VPM1002) were evaluated. 136 To achieve maximum vaccine efficacy and safety, future vaccine research will have to focus on target groups such as neonates 137, 138 or even on the development of personalized vaccines. 139 Systems vaccinology approaches can be further applied to investigate the inter-group differences in vaccine responsiveness between healthy adults and specific target groups such as infants, and elderly or immune-deficient individuals. 140 Investigating vaccine-induced responses with systems vaccinology has led to a trend of gathering massive amounts of data going as deep as investigating every molecule in single cells. Acquiring large data sets is far easier than extracting novel relevant information from those data. Furthermore, the amount of data is constantly increasing, especially when combining data sets of different origin (genes versus proteins versus cells). This requires equally advanced tools for (i) data visualization and (ii) translation of content to knowledge and understanding, forcing a dialogue between vaccine developers and bioinformatics experts. In the future, implementation of artificial intelligence could assist in data processing and for data visualization online publications may become interactive allowing readers to scroll through, for example, the immune responses induced by immunization over time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In summary, systems vaccinology is becoming a valuable tool in each phase of the vaccine development chain. The link with predicting immune responses beforehand is, however, still difficult. Small but important steps are currently taken towards application of the insights created by systems vaccinology. Recent studies show that the application of systems vaccinology is especially interesting for investigating complex or dangerous pathogens such as Ebola virus, HIV, malaria-causing Plasmodium spp. and M. tuberculosis where phase 3 studies are challenging or even impossible, [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] heterologous or non-specific effects that vaccines induce against other diseases. 141 These promising changes call for the inclusion of systems vaccinology as early as possible in the vaccine development chain to better understand why some vaccines work and others do not. This will enable efficiency of vaccine development proportionally in the design phase and will lead to improved vaccine evaluation in early phases, thereby reducing time and costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

115,79c0f8dbc31024ca3901227a97df7d35341d5229,"Ebola virus (EBOV) entry requires the virion surface-associated glycoprotein (GP) that is composed of a trimer of heterodimers (GP1/GP2). The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain (MLD). The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycans, whereas the MLD contains both N-and O-linked glycans. Sitedirected mutagenesis was performed on EBOV GP1 to systematically disrupt N-linked glycan sites to gain an understanding of their role in GP structure and function. All 15 N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1 could be removed without compromising the expression of GP. The loss of these 15 glycosylation sites significantly enhanced pseudovirion transduction in Vero cells, which correlated with an increase in protease sensitivity. Interestingly, exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by removing the glycan shield did not allow interaction with the endosomal receptor, NPC1, indicating that the glycan cap/MLD domains mask RBD residues required for binding. The effects of the loss of GP1 N-linked glycans on Ca 2؉ -dependent (C-type) lectin (CLEC)dependent transduction were complex, and the effect was unique for each of the CLECs tested. Surprisingly, EBOV entry into murine peritoneal macrophages was independent of GP1 N-glycans, suggesting that CLEC-GP1 N-glycan interactions are not required for entry into this important primary cell. Finally, the removal of all GP1 N-glycans outside the MLD enhanced antiserum and antibody sensitivity. In total, our results provide evidence that the conserved N-linked glycans on the EBOV GP1 core protect GP from antibody neutralization despite the negative impact the glycans have on viral entry efficiency. IMPORTANCE Filovirus outbreaks occur sporadically throughout central Africa, causing high fatality rates among the general public and health care workers. These unpredictable hemorrhagic fever outbreaks are caused by multiple species of Ebola viruses, as well as Marburg virus. While filovirus vaccines and therapeutics are being developed, there are no licensed products. The sole viral envelope glycoprotein, which is a principal immunogenic target, contains a heavy shield of glycans surrounding the conserved receptor-binding domain. We find that disruption of this shield through targeted mutagenesis leads to an increase in cell entry, protease sensitivity, and antiserum/antibody sensitivity but is not sufficient to allow virion binding to the intracellular receptor NPC1. Therefore, our studies provide evidence that filoviruses maintain glycoprotein glycosylation to protect against proteases and antibody neutralization at the expense of efficient entry. Our results unveil interesting insights into the unique entry process of filoviruses and potential immune evasion tactics of the virus.","ing diversification of this region of the protein. In contrast, the glycan cap and MLD have extensive sequence diversity between the different Ebola virus species. As the names suggest, both the glycan cap and the MLD are highly glycosylated, resulting in the majority of the protein being masked by glycans (Fig. 1A) (6) . The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycan sites (NGS) and, despite generally poor sequence conservation within the glycan cap, these sites are well conserved among Ebola viruses, suggesting functional significance (Fig. 1C) . In contrast to the glycan cap, the glycosylation events found in the MLD are highly variable between the different viruses and include both N-and O-linked glycans. Despite extensive glycosylation, the MLD remains highly targeted by neutralizing antibodies (7) (8) (9) .
Several roles have been attributed to glycans attached to viral glycoproteins. Glycans can serve as ligands for Ca 2ϩ -dependent (C-type) lectins (CLECs), facilitating viral attachment and internalization in a variety of cell types (10) . Additionally, glycans promote protein folding/stability and virion incorporation of GP, as demonstrated in studies with Newcastle disease virus and Lassa virus (11, 12) . In the case of Nipah virus G/F proteins, not only does glycosylation help protein expression, it also decreases membrane fusion efficiency, thereby controlling premature fusion events (13, 14) . Furthermore, the glycans on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120/gp41, Nipah virus G/F, hepatitis C virus E1/E2, and influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protect virions from antibody-mediated neutralization (15) . Despite the high degree of glycosylation found on filovirus GPs, the importance of the N-linked glycans on EBOV GP1 to the structure and function of the protein has not been well studied. Here, we assess the structural and functional importance of N-linked glycans on EBOV GP1.
To determine the role of GP1 N-glycans in EBOV GP-dependent entry, a library of over 40 individual and combinatorial mutations were made to disrupt the N-linked glycan sites (NGS; N-X-S/T sequons) within the GP1 subunit. We generated NGS mutations in GP1 of both GP and the MLD-deleted GP (GP1⌬muc) (for details of all mutations, see Table S1 in the supplemental material). NGS mutants were expressed in HEK293T cells and pseudotyped onto VSV⌬G-eGFP (expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein). The relative expression levels of wild-type (WT) or NGS mutant GP were determined by assessing the GP-to-VSV matrix ratios present in cell supernatants by dot blot analysis. In addition, the transduction efficiencies of the pseudovirions were assessed in Vero cells.
Initial studies were performed to disrupt the seven NGS within the GP1 core of GP1⌬muc and GP. Reduced levels of glycosylation on mutant GPs that were pseudotyped onto VSV were apparent in immunoblots, evidenced by faster migration of the mutant proteins (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). The expression of WT and mutant GPs in supernatants and the transduction of Vero cells mediated by these virions are summarized in Fig. S2 . Notably, removing more than 3 glycans from the GP1 core significantly decreased the expression of GP1⌬muc and concomitantly reduced its transduction. However, all 7 glycan sites within the GP1 core could be removed (7G) with no effect on GP expression and a significant enhancement in transduction over that of the WT, suggesting that the MLD provides stability that allows the removal of glycans from the GP1 core ( Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, these mutant GPs were incorporated into purified virions at a rate equivalent to the incorporation of the WT (Fig. S1B) .
Since complete deglycosylation of the core domains of GP1 did not negatively impact the expression of GP or the transduction of pseudotyped virions, we systematically combined N-linked glycan mutations in the MLD with our 7G mutant. Surprisingly, we were able to disrupt all NGS within GP1 without affecting expression (7Gm8G) ( Fig. 2A ; see also Fig. S2E in the supplemental material). Comparison of the 7Gm8G mutant and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F)-treated GP with immunoblot analysis confirmed that the 7Gm8G mutant lacked all N-linked glycans (Fig. S1C ). Pseudovirion transduction of Vero cells was significantly enhanced in all GP mutants that lacked the N40 glycan ( Fig. 2B; Fig. S2D ), and is shown in light gray, RBD is shown in red, and MLD structure that has not been solved is represented as a gray sphere.

Lennemann et al.
virion transduction was further enhanced by the removal of all NGS within the GP1 core (7G) or the core and MLD (7Gm8G). Consistent with our findings with 7Gm8G, the elimination of N-glycans solely within the MLD (GPm8G) also led to a modest but consistent increase in transduction, suggesting that NGS in both the core and MLD decreased transduction. In total, these results indicated that N-linked glycans are not required for entry into Vero cells but, rather, decrease the efficiency of entry. GP1 N-glycans do not affect virion attachment to Vero cells. As extensive N-linked deglycosylation of GP led to greater transduction, we sought to identify which step(s) in EBOV entry were affected by the loss of N-linked sugars. Removing the GP1 N-glycans within the GP1 core (7G) or throughout GP1 (7Gm8G) did not affect the binding of pseudovirions to the cell surface (see Fig. S3 , top, in the supplemental material) and the binding of all virions tested was decreased to similar levels (~50% reduction) in the presence of a calcium chelator, EGTA (Fig. S3 , middle). This finding was not unexpected, since EBOV entry into Vero cells has been shown to be mediated by the phosphatidylserine receptor, TIM-1, which binds to virion-associated phosphatidylserine in a calcium-dependent manner (16) .
Removal of GP1 N-glycans imparts CatB independence and increases protease sensitivity. Endosomal processing of EBOV GP by cathepsin B (CatB) is an important step in EBOV entry that results in the removal of both the MLD and glycan cap, exposing the RBD (17) (18) (19) (20) . Additionally, it has been shown that disruption of the N40 NGS (T42A mutation) leads to CatB independence in the absence of the MLD (21) . As the inclusion of a similar mutation (T42V) in our glycoprotein mutants consistently led to enhanced transduction, we assessed whether the increase in transduction by our mutants correlated with increased CatB independence. Pseudovirion entry mediated by GP1⌬muc, GP, the 6G mutant, containing a fully deglycosylated glycan cap, and the GPm8G mutant containing a MLD that was fully deglycosylated for N-linked glycans were abrogated by treating Vero cells with the CatB inhibitor CA-074, which profoundly blocked CatB activity (Fig. S4A ). These data indicated that these GPs were dependent upon CatB processing for subsequent transduction steps (Fig. 3A ). VSV pseudotyped with the native glycoprotein (VSV-G) served as a control in these studies and was completely resistant to the drug. As anticipated, the mutant with a mutation of T42 in the absence of the MLD was significantly less sensitive to CA-074 ( Fig. 3A , T42V⌬muc); however, we did not observe complete CatB independence as has been previously reported (21) , possibly due to a Val rather than Ala substitution at this site. Assessment of the T42V mutant in the context of GP also demonstrated partial CA-074 independence. The CatB independence of 7G was similar to that of the T42V mutant, and removing all N-linked glycans in GP1 (7Gm8G) enhanced CatB independence slightly more. Our observed trend of enhanced transduction with increasing elimination of GP1 N-linked glycans was more robust than the trend of CatB independence with our mutants. As glycosylation is known to protect from proteases (22), we determined whether removing glycans increased the protease sensitivity of GP. Previous work has shown that treatment with 200 g/ml thermolysin (THL) results in an~20-fold increase in GP-mediated transduction associated with complete removal of the glycan cap and MLD (20, 21) . To initially assess THL sensitivity, we evaluated the transduction efficiency of GP and 7Gm8G following treatment with increasing concentrations of THL up to a high concentration (200 g/ml). 7Gm8G was dramatically more sensitive to low concentrations of THL than GP, providing evidence that the deglycosylated GP was more readily proteolytically processed (Fig. S4B ). Given these results, a panel of NGS mutants was evaluated for the relationship between entry and sensitivity of deglycosylated GP to low concentrations (1.25 g/ml) of protease (Fig. 3B) . A correlation between the number of mutations and the THL sensitivity was observed. The results from 7G and GPm8G indicated that the removal of glycans from the core has a greater effect on protease sensitivity, possibly due to the large number of O-glycans still present in the MLD. However, 7Gm8G showed the greatest protease sensitivity, suggesting an additive effect when the mutations of 7G and GPm8G were combined. These findings indicated that N-glycans in the glycan cap and, to a lesser extent, in the MLD control the efficiency of proteolytic processing, thereby regulating subsequent steps in entry, such as binding to the endosomal receptor, NPC1.
Removal of glycans shielding the RBD does not allow for NPC1 binding. Enzymatic removal of the glycan cap and MLD allows interaction of GP with the endosomal receptor NPC1 (23, 24) . Consequently, we postulated that exposing the RBD by disrupting NGS within the GP1 core and MLD might enhance the binding of GP to NPC1. In an NPC1 binding assay, a soluble form of the second luminal domain (C loop) of NPC1, which directly interacts with residues in the RBD of EBOV GP (23) , was used to bind VSV pseudovirions. Treatment of GP with THL, which is commonly used to mimic GP cleavage by CatB/-L in removing the MLD and glycan cap (20, 21) , resulted in binding of C loop over a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 3C) . However, exposure of the RBD through deglycosylation (7Gm8G) did not lead to binding of the NPC1 C loop above the background level, indicating that loss of the N-linked glycans on GP1 does not abrogate the need for endosomal proteolysis that is required for receptor interactions. This result suggests that, while N-glycans on GP may interfere with the ability of the RBD to interact with this endosomal receptor, glycan interference is not the sole explanation for the inability of GP to bind to NPC1.
Domain-specific N-linked deglycosylation alters C-type lectin utilization. CLECs, which mediate GP-dependent entry, are expressed on a wide variety of EBOV target cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and hepatic cells, and each binds to specific glycan moieties (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) . To better understand the role of EBOV GP1 N-linked glycans in CLEC-dependent tropism, we determined the receptor utilization of mutants that lack N-linked glycans on the GP1 core (7G), the MLD (GPm8G), or both (7Gm8G). Constructs expressing Myc-tagged CLECs were transfected into poorly permissive HEK293T cells. To enhance expression, the ectodomains of CLECs DC-SIGN and human MGL (hMGL) were fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of L-SIGN (resulting in constructs L DC-SIGN and L hMGL, respectively). All constructs expressed well in transfected cells (Fig. S5) .
In these experiments, transfection of a TIM-1-expressing plasmid served as a transduction control, since TIM-1-dependent entry into endosomes is GP independent and should be independent of the GP glycosylation status (16, 30) . Consistent with this, the entry of all pseudovirions was similarly enhanced by transfection of TIM-1 (Fig. 4A) .
While all five CLECs enhanced the transduction of WT GP between 6-and 13-fold, the impact of the loss of GP1 N-glycans on transduction varied depending on the CLEC examined (Fig. 4B to F). Entry mediated by L-SIGN, L DC-SIGN, and LSECtin was highly dependent on N-glycans present throughout GP1; however, LSECtin-dependent entry was less dependent on N-glycans present in the GP1 core (Fig. 4B to D) . Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGPRI)-mediated entry was completely independent of N-glycans in the GP1 core. While the loss of NGS in the MLD resulted in a trend of decreased transduction, this did not achieve statistical significance (Fig. 4E) . Furthermore, this CLEC was able to mediate entry independently of GP1 N-glycans. N-linked deglycosylation had a minimal impact on GP-mediated entry into cells expressing L hMGL (Fig. 4F) . The results obtained with ASGPRI and L hMGL were consistent with previous reports indicating that ligands for these CLECs are present in O-linked glycans present in the MLD or, potentially, in N-linked glycans on GP2.
CLEC-expressing HEK293T cells were also used to evaluate the impact of N-linked glycans on our MLD deletion mutant, GP1⌬muc. In these studies, we compared the transduction of GP1⌬muc to that of 5G⌬muc. While our 5G⌬muc mutant was poorly expressed and resulted in low levels of transduction compared to the transduction of GP1⌬muc (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), the levels of 5G⌬muc transduction were about 50% of the levels observed with GP and sufficient to allow transduction studies to be performed (Fig. S6) . All five CLECs enhanced GP1⌬muc transduction, increasing entry by 4.5-to 22fold ( Fig. 4B to F) . In all cases, the loss of five of the N-linked glycans (5G⌬muc) on the glycan cap resulted in a decrease in transduction, with the reduction being more modest for transduction mediated by L DC-SIGN, ASGPRI, and L hMGL. As the better transduction of 5G⌬muc into cells expressing L DC-SIGN, ASG-PRI, and L hMGL cannot result from interactions with MLD glycans, this enhancement must be due to either the two remaining intact N-glycans on the GP1 core at N40 and N204 or the two N-glycans on GP2. Additionally, the differences in 5G⌬mucmediated transduction observed between L-SIGN and L DC-SIGN indicate that these CLECs have different ligand specificities, despite both binding to high-mannose oligosaccharides.
N-linked glycans on GP1 are not required for entry into macrophages. Macrophages are major, early targets during filovirus infections, and others have suggested that CLECs may be important for entry into these cells (31) (32) (33) . Previous work has shown that murine MGL and SIGNR1, the murine homolog of DC-SIGN, are expressed on peritoneal macrophages (34, 35) . We used our most extensively deglycosylated mutants to determine the role of N-linked and O-linked glycans in entry into these cells. Since VSV is highly sensitive to the type I interferon response (36), resident peritoneal cells were isolated from IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice for these studies. In addition, these mice lacked TIM-1, which eliminated the possibility for entry in epithelial cells that may have contaminated the preparations. Cells were treated for 3 days with murine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and their phenotypes were determined prior to use. Eighty-five percent of adherent cells from the peritoneal cavity were CD11b ϩ /F480 ϩ , indicative of matured macrophages (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). These cells were highly permissive for VSV pseudotyped with GP (Fig. 5) . Entry mediated by 7Gm8G was en-hanced~3-fold over entry mediated by the WT, which is more consistent with our Vero cell data than with our CLEC utilization data. Furthermore, macrophages supported entry mediated by the 5G⌬muc mutation, although this was~15-fold decreased compared to the results for the WT. These findings demonstrated that neither O-or N-linked glycans on GP1 are absolutely required for entry into peritoneal macrophages.
Removal of N-linked glycans enhances antiserum sensitivity. Our studies indicated that the most deglycosylated EBOV GP1 mutants were expressed at WT levels and provided the highest levels of transduction into Vero cells and peritoneal macrophages. Nonetheless, the conservation of the glycan sites, particularly in the GP1 core sequences, across the species suggested that positive selection for these sites was occurring. Therefore, our deglycosylated EBOV GPs were evaluated for their sensitivity to antiserum neutralization, since deglycosylation may increase the exposure of potential EBOV GP epitopes. Purified anti-EBOV IgG from convalescent cynomolgus macaques that were vaccinated prior to challenge with Ebola virus (a gift from John M. Dye, USAMRIID) was incubated with VSV pseudovirions that were normalized for the amount of matrix protein. Little to no enhancement of antiserum sensitivity was observed with a mutant lacking three glycans in the GP core; however, the removal of six glycans from the glycan cap increased the neutralization sensitivity more than 4-fold ( Fig. 6A and C) . In contrast, VSV pseudotyped with the Marburg virus GP was not neutralized by anti-EBOV IgG. Complete deglycosylation of the GP1 core (7G) led to a further increase in antiserum sensitivity ( Fig. 6B and C) . Since the MLD is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (7-9), we anticipated that the removal of N-glycans from this domain would enhance anti-EBOV IgG sensitivity. Surprisingly, GPm8G was no more sensitive to neutralization than WT GP (Fig. 6B) , indicating that NGS in the MLD had little to no positive or negative effect on neutralization by the pooled anti-EBOV IgG. Consistent with this, removal of all N-linked glycans on GP1 (7Gm8G) did not enhance antibody neutralization beyond that observed with deglycosylation of GP1 core (7G). We found similar but less pronounced neutralization sensitivity with pooled sera collected from mice surviving challenge with mouse-adapted EBOV (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material).
EBOV GP1 is highly glycosylated, yet limited studies have investigated the role of these sugar chains on GP function to date. In this report, we determined the effects of removing the N-linked glycans present on the EBOV GP1 subunit by examining the impact on protein expression/stability, viral entry, and antiserum/ antibody sensitivity. Surprisingly, the elimination of all N-linked glycans on GP1 had no effect on the expression levels of GP, suggesting that, in the presence of the MLD, N-linked glycans attached to GP1 are not critical for GP folding. However, as our Future studies to test our deglycosylated GPs in the context of recombinant filoviruses to verify our findings are warranted. The loss of GP1 NGS significantly decreased the utilization of four of the five C-type lectins known to be used by EBOV GP for entry, while it enhanced EBOV transduction into Vero cells and peritoneal macrophages. The enhanced levels of transduction were associated with enhanced sensitivity to thermolysin cleavage, but deglycosylation did not alleviate the need for proteolysis prior to NPC1 binding. Finally, the loss of highly conserved glycans on the core of GP1 increased virus sensitivity to antibody neutralization. Therefore, we propose that the strong conservation of individual glycosylation sites in the GP1 core across the Ebola virus genus results, at least in part, from selective pressures to protect the virus against immune responses, despite the fact that these sites collectively can have a negative impact on GP-dependent entry. Modeling N-linked glycans onto the GP1⌬muc structure suggests that the highly conserved RBD of Ebola viruses is effectively masked and protected by glycan cap glycans attached to wellconserved NGS, likely protecting the RBD against selective immune pressures, as previously proposed (6, 8, 9, 15, 18, 37) . However, we provide the first experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. Our results suggest that there are neutralizing epitopes in the GP1 core that are normally masked by N-glycans. Surprisingly, the removal of N-glycans from the MLD, which is highly targeted by neutralizing antibodies (7-9), did not affect antiserum sensitivity. Neutralizing epitopes within the MLD that do not appear to be affected by the loss of N-linked glycans may be obstructed by the large number of O-glycans attached to the MLD. Alternatively, neutralizing epitopes within the MLD may target O-linked glycan sequons. Since filovirus hemorrhagic fevers are acute and often lethal infections in primates, it is likely that antibody-driven positive selection for NGS surrounding conserved regions occurs in nonprimate reservoirs, such as bats. Thus, it is important to understand filovirus infection and persistence in bat populations.
A role for CLECs in EBOV GP-dependent entry has been firmly established by others (32, 33, 38, 39) . We have shown for the first time that the removal of N-glycans from either the glycan cap (7G) or MLD (GPm8G) dramatically decreases the utilization of DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, and LSECtin. Surprisingly, these same CLECs enhanced the transduction mediated by GP1⌬muc, despite this form of the protein sharing exactly the same pattern of NGS as GPm8G. Another surprising finding was that hMGL utilization was largely unaffected by the loss of GP1 N-glycans. This provided indirect evidence that hMGL-dependent EBOV transduction is strongly dependent on O-linked glycans in GP. However, despite the apparent utilization of O-linked glycans by hMGL, the transduction mediated by GP1⌬muc was greatly enhanced by the expression of this CLEC (32) . In combination, these two sets of results suggest that deletion of the MLD alters the species of glycans present on GP1. Such a conclusion is consistent with previous work showing that glycosylation differences exist between GP and the small, soluble form of GP (sGP), which shares the same NGS with GP1⌬muc (40). More glycan processing was found on sGP, indicated by the higher percentage of galactose residues and lower percentage of high-mannose glycans. Since the types of glycans present on proteins are largely dependent on the environment in which the protein is produced (41) , it is possible that the cytotoxicity associated with overexpression of GP (42, 43) or the large number of O-glycans present changes the glycosylation machinery in the ER/Golgi.
Previous work has shown that macrophages are important cellular targets during the early days of filovirus infection (31) . The effective transduction of murine peritoneal macrophages by N-glycan-deficient GP1-bearing pseudovirions, along with our findings that hMGL-dependent enhancement of transduction was relatively independent of the presence of GP1 N-glycans, supports the idea proposed by others (32) that EBOV entry into macrophages may be mediated by this CLEC. However, additional mechanisms of EBOV entry into macrophages are also likely to be important, particularly in light of our findings that 7Gm8G pseudovirions have~300% better transduction of macrophages than GP, yet 7Gm8G transduces hMGL-expressing cells at~60% of the transduction level of the WT. We and others have identified that TIM family members mediate virus uptake into cells by interacting with phosphatidylserine on the surface of virions (16, 30) , and it is possible that this uptake mechanism is important for EBOV entry into macrophages. Future studies need to explore the role for phosphatidylserine receptors during in vivo filovirus infection. Our findings that deglycosylation of GP pseudovirions enhances the transduction of Vero cells and peritoneal macrophages provides evidence that the N-glycans on GP1 decrease the efficiency of the entry process. The removal of glycans masking the RBD enhanced proteolytic processing of GP but did not result in the ability of unprocessed EBOV GP to bind the C loop of NPC1, consistent with an earlier study demonstrating that the removal of the MLD did not unmask the RBD for NPC1 interaction (23) . This result suggests that there are residues that are critical for NPC1 binding, such as F88 (23) , that are masked by the glycan cap/MLD polypeptide rather than being concealed by the heavy glycan shield. Thus, it is likely that the increased sensitivity of our deglycosylated mutants to proteolytic processing results in more efficient transit through the endosomal compartments, leading to greater transduction efficiency.
In these studies, we found that protease sensitivity and CatB dependence are independently controlled within GP1. For instance, GPm8G, which retains the N40 glycosylation site, was completely dependent on CatB but had enhanced thermolysin sensitivity. In contrast, the T42V mutant was found to be partially CatB independent but no more sensitive to thermolysin than WT GP. It was previously hypothesized that mutation of residue T42, which eliminates the N-glycan at N40, allows endosomal proteases other than CatB to process GP within the endosome (21) . Extrapolating from these studies, we hypothesized that systematic deglycosylation would yield an EBOV GP that was progressively more CatB independent. However, this was not the case; extensive deglycosylation beyond loss of the N40 glycan sequon did not further alleviate dependence on CatB but did increase thermolysin sensitivity. Additionally, mutants with mutations of N40 and T42 were shown to display different protease sensitivities, suggesting that the glycan is not the only factor in determining CatB dependence (21) .
Previous work has shown that cellular receptors influence the intracellular trafficking and endosomal fate of viruses (44) . EBOV entry requires a specific intracellular compartment that requires CatB, the HOPS complex, and NPC1 (19, 20, 21, 24, 45) . However, similar to our CatB-independent EBOV mutants, not all filoviruses require CatB cleavage for entry (46) . Therefore, deglycosylated mutants with distinct protease dependence and sensitivity profiles may be useful in the further characterization of the endosomal compartments that allow for the efficient entry of filoviruses.
Pseudovirion matrix and glycoprotein quantitation. Equal volumes of cell supernatants containing pseudovirions from three independent stocks were lysed in native lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] with 0.025% NP-40) and then passed through a dot blot apparatus onto nitrocellulose (Whatman). Wells were washed 5ϫ with PBS before being blocked in PBS with 10% nonfat milk for 1 h. Dot blots were incubated with the mouse anti-VSV matrix monoclonal antibody (MAb) 23H12 (a gift from Douglas Lyles) and the human anti-EBOV GP MAb KZ52 (a gift from Erica Saphire and Dennis Burton) diluted in PBS with 10% nonfat milk and 0.15% Tween-20 overnight at 4°C. By using separate IRDyeconjugated secondary antibodies (Abs) (LI-COR) directed toward the primary Abs, we were able to detect both VSV matrix protein and EBOV within a single well for each sample. The signals were visualized and quantified using an Odyssey Imaging Station and Image Studio software (LI-COR), which has been shown to be more sensitive and quantitative than enhanced chemiluminescence (47) . Thermolysin sensitivity assay. VSV pseudovirions, normalized for GP expression, were incubated with 200 g/ml, 2-fold serial dilutions starting with 5 g/ml, or a single concentration of 1.25 g/ml of thermolysin (THL) at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction mixtures were immediately placed on ice and diluted 20-fold in growth medium containing 50 M phosphoramidon (Sigma), a THL inhibitor. THL-treated pseudovirions were evaluated for Vero cell transduction. GFP-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Antibody/antiserum neutralization assay. Serial dilutions of fractionated IgG pooled from 36 convalescent, vaccinated cynomolgus macaques challenged with EBOV (gift from John M. Dye, USAMRIID) or pooled convalescent sera from mice challenged with mouse-adapted EBOV (gift from Gene Olinger, USAMRIID) were incubated at 37°C for 30 min with pseudotyped VSV bearing the glycoproteins studied and normalized for the amount of matrix protein. The mixtures were diluted 5-fold in growth medium and added to Vero cells plated in a 48-well format. GFP-positive cells were enumerated with flow cytometry. The relative antiserum sensitivities were calculated as the reciprocals of the 50% infective concentration (IC 50 ) values determined with GraphPad Prism 5.

116,df62b9ff3b2b95896d4b90ccefc9f3d756be1abf,"Pneumonia refers to lung inflammation caused by different pathogens or other factors, and is a common pediatric disease occurring in infants and young children. It is closely related to the anatomical and physiological characteristics of infants and young children and is more frequent during winter and spring, or sudden changes in temperature. Pneumonia is a serious disease that poses a threat to children's health and its morbidity and mortality rank first, accounting for 24.5-65.2% of pediatric inpatients. Due to juvenile age, severe illness and rapid changes, children often suffer acute heart failure, respiratory failure and even toxic encephalopathy at the same time. The concurrence in different stages of the process of emergency treatment tends to relapse, which directly places the lives of these children at risk. Severe pneumonia constitutes one of the main causes of infant mortality. In the process of nursing children with severe pneumonia, intensive care was provided, including condition assessment and diagnosis, close observation of disease, keeping the airway unblocked, rational oxygen therapy, prevention and treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure, support of vital organs, complications, and health education. The inflammatory response was proactively controlled, to prevent suffocation and reduce mortality. In summary, positive and effective nursing can promote the rehabilitation of children patients, which can be reinforced with adequate communication with the parents and/or caretakers.","Severe pneumonia is a common life-threatening disease, particularly for children, and is more common in infants and young children (1, 2) . The estimated worldwide incidence of severe pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age is 50-80 per 1,000 person-years and the mortality is 1.0-5.5 per 1,000 person-years (3) (4) (5) . It often occurs in the winter and spring, with acute onset, complex clinical manifestations and fast-changing condition, which usually involves the circulation, nervous and digestive systems (1) (2) (3) . As a result, severe pneumonia produces corresponding clinical symptoms, such as respiratory failure, heart failure, toxic encephalopathy and intestinal paralysis, which endanger the lives of children in the short term, and is the first cause of death of pediatric inpatients (6, 7) . It is listed as the one of the four diseases requiring prevention and treatment in children by the Ministry of Health (8, 9) .
Pneumonia may occur at any point of the year, but is more common in the months of winter and spring or during the time of climate variability. The disease may be the primary illness, or secondary one after an acute infectious disease, such as bronchitis and measles, upper respiratory tract infections and whooping cough, and has a high morbidity and mortality rate in China (10) . As reported by several studies, the number of annual pneumonia patients in China is ≤21 million individuals, and among the children with pneumonia, 7-13% cases are of severe pneumonia, which ranks fifth amongst various diseases leading to death (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) .
The aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 10 cases of children presenting with severe pneumonia at the Xuzhou Children's Hospital between January 2009 and June 2012, retrieve and review the literature, and summarize emergency treatment and nursing experience.
General information. Ten cases of children diagnosed with severe pneumonia according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization were included in the present study (16) . In this group, there were 6 males and 4 females, aged 1 month to 6 years. The children patients were hospitalized due to fever, cough, asthma, dry and wet rales could be heard in lung auscultation, and a chest X-ray showed thickened lung markings with visible punctate and flake-like shadows. The children patients refused any intake of dairy products or food. There was one case of concurrent toxic encephalopathy, 1 case of gastrointestinal bleeding, and 1 case of toxic intestinal paralysis. The physical examination showed a body temperature of 38.5-40˚C, pulse rate of 120-190 beats/min, breathing of 30-60 beats/min, and dry and wet rales could be heard in lung. The X-ray examination showed thickened lung markings, and flake-like shadows, and abdominal palpation showed enlarged liver and spleen. Respiratory or circulatory functions were at different levels of exhaustion.
Treatment. After admission, comprehensive emergency treatment measures were taken, such as improving the ventilation function, oxygen uptake, maintaining airway patency, administration of cardiac and diuretic drugs, reduction of intracranial pressure, and conducting anti-infection and symptomatic support measures.
Nine cases were successfully treated, 1 case succumbed to respiratory failure, and the success rate was 90%.
Condition assessment and diagnosis. A detailed inquiry of the medical history was carried out to determine whether the children patients had a history of recurrent respiratory tract infection, and whether they had measles, whooping cough and other respiratory diseases prior to onset, as well as whether the children patients had a full-term birth or asphyxia, and if the growth and development of children patients after birth was normal (16) (17) (18) . Conditions such as fever, cough, extent of choked asthma, the presence or absence of breathing, faster heart rate, pulmonary rales, orthopnea, nose flap, three depression signs and cyanosis, as well as clinical manifestations of infected circulatory, digestive, and nervous system were assessed. Evaluation of blood routine examination, chest X-ray, and etiology test results were conducted. Psychological and social conditions of children and parents were also assessed (19) .
Common condition assessment and diagnostic criteria included: i) Air exchange impairment, related to lung inflammation; ii) invalid airway clearance, related to excessive and sticky respiratory secretions, frail children patients, and inability to expectorate; iii) hyperthermia, related to lung infection; and iv) malnutrition, related to inadequate intake, increased consumption.
Close observation of the condition. Attention was paid to changes in total peripheral resistance blood pressure (BP), the presence of double suction, such as nodding-like breathing, apnea and other conditions indicating respiratory failure. The presence of exacerbation of dyspnea, dysphoria, quickening heart rate, and an enlarged liver in a short period of time suggested heart failure (20) (21) (22) . Children patients with severe wheezing often suffered respiratory acidosis due to retention of carbon dioxide. Drowsiness, convulsions or coma in sick children suggested an occurrence of toxic encephalopathy. Medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatic drugs, cardiac drugs and other medications were administered to patients at the appropriate dosage, the appropriate time and in an accurate manner. Side effects of various drugs were observed, and if children patients showed signs of dysphoria, quickening heart rate, worsening asthma, or enlarged liver in a short period of time, indicating heart failure, then the infusion rate was reduced. In our study, close observation of consciousness, pupil changes and muscle tension was carried out, and if manifestations of intracranial pressure such as drowsiness, convulsions, irregular breathing and increased muscle tension appeared, immediate rescue steps were taken. Abdominal distension and decreased or disappearing bowel sounds were observed, in order to detect toxic intestinal paralysis in time (23) .
Emergency treatment and therapy for respiratory failure. Type I respiratory failure refers to the lone presence of hypoxemia and absence of hypercapnia, featuring ventilation dysfunctions, blood change of PaO 2 ≤60 mmHg, and PaCO 2 which can be maintained at normal level or reduced (24) . Type I respiratory failure also refers to the coexistence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia, impairment of ventilatory function and gas exchange functions, severe lung lesion, obstruction of trachea and bronchia caused by sticky secretions, blood change of PaO 2 <60 mmHg, and PaCO 2 >50 mmHg. Main clinical manifestations of children patients with type I pneumonia with respiratory failure include, poor mental state or dysphoria, polypnea, cyanosis of lips, dyspnea, nasal flaring and three depression signs. These symptoms are difficult to distinguish from type II respiratory failure, and can be observed only by blood gas analysis, which shows a marked difference between type I and II. Type II respiratory failure shows symptoms of type I respiratory failure and in addition more often than not, it also has symptoms such as shallow breathing, irregular rhythm, slow breathing, drowsiness or coma and even jaw breathing in some patients (25, 26) . In our study, changes in condition and changes in blood were closely observed, and where required, a tracheal intubation ventilator was employed to improve the cure rate.
Oxygen uptake. Nasal catheter is easily blocked by secretions, leading to failure of effective uptake oxygen, and is therefore difficult to utilize. We employed the conventional oxygen mask inhalation method, which is comfortable and without stimulation, and was easily accepted by children (27, 28) . After using oxygen, once hypoxia was improved, timely adjustment of the oxygen flow or deactivation of oxygen was needed, because inadequate oxygen concentration such as excessive or overtime concentration may lead to changes such as lung tissue edema atelectasis and proliferation of alveolar capillary. The humidification bottle contained 50% alcohol, aiming to reduce the alveolar surface tension and help improve ventilation.
Maintenance of airway patency and administration of various aerosol inhalation therapies. i) This group of children patients took appropriate clinostatism according to the state of disease. Under normal conditions, the children were placed in a horizontal position, with neck raised high, in order that airways would be unblocked. For children patients with severe heart failure and wheezing, semi-recumbent position was taken to reduce the burden on the heart and lungs (29, 30) . For children patients with increased respiratory secretions, the lateral position was useful to expectorate and prevent aspiration. ii) Patients received daily routine aerosol inhalation, turning drugs into aerialfog-like fine particles, inhaled to the bronchioles or alveoli, which diluted secretions and had an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic function and reduced local inflammatory exudates, in addition to reducing airway resistance and improving ventilation. Aerosol inhalation time was 10-15 min and afterwards sputum suction was carried out immediately in order to clear respiratory secretions.
Commonly used drugs included: 20,000 units of gentamicin, 2-3 mg of α-chymotrypsin, 1-2 mg of dexamethasone, and 20 ml of saline. The dual role of the aforementioned ultrasonic aerosol inhalation was useful to reinforce treatment of children with severe pneumonia. According to the disease, aerosol inhalation was conducted every 4 or 6 h, with sputum suction ensuing, which produced a good suction effect for children patients with many sticky respiratory secretions. It should be noted that if patients had excessive sputum, the sputum suction was also carried out once prior to using ultrasound aerosol inhalation therapy, followed by thorough sputum suction. In the whole process of aerosol inhalation, providing oxygen inhalation or enhancing oxygen concentration effectively prevented the occurrence of hypoxemia (31) . iii) Hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus, which causes obstruction and sudden suffocation. First, the child patient's tongue tip was pulled outside the mouth, and then artificial respiration was conducted, with most patients being able to relieve themselves spontaneously. Pressurized oxygen was given, endotracheal intubation was carried out if necessary and calcium was replenished immediately. iv) When nasal obstruction caused breathing difficulties, 1% ephedrine drops were used after clearing away nasal secretions with a cotton swab, to maintain the airway patency. v) The diet of children with severe pneumonia was affected due to high fever, vomiting, diarrhea and other factors. When children patients were unable to eat, it was appropriate to supplement water, electrolytes, vitamins, and give them high-calorie, high protein, digestible food, that was eaten in small amounts but frequently, to prevent satiety from interfering with respiratory function. vi) Previous findings showed that, ambroxol and low-dose heparin coupled with aerosol inhalation significantly shortened the time of the disappearance of all the clinical signs and improved overall efficiency of the clinical treatment (32, 33) . There was no bleeding and other adverse reactions involved in the clinical treatment process, which had advantages such as easy administration, safe use, inexpensiveness, a significant effect, and less adverse effects in the treatment of children with severe pneumonia, and was thus worthy of wider application.
Since the application of mechanical ventilation is prone to cause ventilator-related complications, to improve the successful rescue rate of children with severe pneumonia and shorten the course of treatment, the use of NCPAP may be considered a priority. For severe pneumonia, NCPAP can support cardiopulmonary function, and its early application can improve timely oxygenation, stabilize disease, prevent disease progression, reduce ventilator application and average hospitalization time in pediatric intensive care unit as well as avoid the adverse effects caused by intubation (34) . However, two points are important when applying it to infants: i) grasp indications and standard of respiratory failure that the children comply with; ii) over NCPAP application process, nasal and oral secretions should be immediately removed, raising the neck high, to strengthen expectoration in order to maintain airway patency. Operating parameters of using the NCPAP oxygen therapy machine in our department: i) Oxygen concentration inhaled (FiO2) 40 or 90%; ii) the oxygen flow 4-12 l/min; and iii) the beginning pressure was maintained at 3-4 cm H 2 O. After observing 2-4 h, the adjustment of pressure was determined by clinical symptoms, signs and blood gas analysis. NCPAP is an effective treatment for severe pneumonia with respiratory and heart failure, and can quickly correct hypoxemia, reduce endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation demand (35) . It has a positive effect and can reduce the stimulation of children, thus decreasing any occurrence of ventilator pneumonia. In addition, parents readily accepted this treatment (36) .
Short-term intubation ventilator was utilized when there was: i) Respiratory arrest or respiratory and cardiac arrest; ii) sputum congestion, dyspnea, serious cyanosis; and iii) blood PaCO 2 >60 mmHg, in order to accelerate the discharge of PaCO 2 and reduce respiratory acidosis.
Emergency treatment and treatment of heart failure. When children patients coughed, their body temperature increased to ≤40˚C and was accompanied by dyspnea, dysphoria, pale face, cyanosis, drowsiness, fixed moist rales in lung, respiratory rate of ≥60 beats/min, heart rate of ≥160-180 beats/min in quiet state, low and blunt heart sound, gallop rate, and a progressively enlarged liver, 3 cm beyond the ribs or an increase of ≥1.5 cm in a short period of time. The above, as well as cold extremities and weak pulse, constituted clinical manifestations of a heart failure. In this situation, oxygen inhalation and tranquilizers were given immediately, 0.5 µg/(kg x min) and milrinone, a second generation of phosphodiesterase Ⅲ (PDE-Ⅲ) inhibitor, which acts on the β receptor accessory pathway, was administered to maintain heart function. By selectively inhibiting PDE-Ⅲ in myocardial cells, increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, promoting calcium influx, enhancing calcium concentration in myocardial cytolymph, milrinone strengthens myocardial contractility, increases cardiac output, and exerts direct relaxation on vascular smooth muscle, dilates blood vessels and reduces cardiac preload and afterload. Milrinone demonstrates a better clinical efficacy in the treatment of children with pneumonia complicated by heart failure than catecholamines (37) .
Emergency treatment and treatment of toxic encephalopathy and intestinal paralysis. When children show signs of exhaustion, dysphoria, coma, increased muscle tension, irregular breathing, and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, toxic encephalopathy should be considered. Timely administration of sedatives, oxygen and mannitol are important in order to ease cerebral edema.
Decrease in intracranial pressure. In the present study, any changes including children' pupillary light reflex, headache, vomiting, consciousness, breathing, pulse, temperature, and fluctuation in BP were closely observed. The head was raised 15-30˚ to facilitate the intracranial venous return, leading to a corresponding reduction in intracranial pressure. Precaution was taken when using dehydrating agent as well as to prevent it from leaking from blood vessels, and to prevent tissue necrosis. When administering furosemide, its effect and adverse drug reactions were observed. If intracranial pressure increased, lumbar puncture was avoided as much as possible, but if it had to be carried out then rescue preparation was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid flow is not be in excess to avoid the formation of hernia.
Control of fever and convulsions. An increase in body temperature leads to an increased oxygen consumption in brain tissue, and aggravating cerebral hypoxia, which causes cerebral edema and nerve cell damage (38) . Immediate measures must be taken to control hyperpyrexia by combining the use of artificial hibernation to decrease the temperature, lower metabolism and protect the central nervous system. The drug of choice is the application of cold compressors of chlorpromazine to the head, wearing ice caps and decreasing the temperature with drugs, thereby reducing hyperpyrexia-induced damage to brain tissue.
For children patients in the study, when intracranial pressure increased, the motor cortex wass stimulated, causing convulsions and exacerbating cerebral hypoxia and brain edema, thereby aggravating intracranial pressure. The ward was kept quiet and visitors were avoided. Treatment and care were performed simultaneously, as much as possible, and operating and any negative stimuli were reduced to prevent convulsions. Seizures required the focus of intensive nursing, a dental pad was placed between the upper and lower teeth to prevent tongue bite, and extra gear was added to prevent any fall damage during sleep. Drugs, such as phenobarbital and diazepam were administered to control fear. Restless children were guarded by specially-assigned persons to prevent scratches and fall damage. Heads of children in a coma were leaned to one side, to facilitate the discharge of secretions. should be given. For any child having a seizure, it was considered improper for the fright-checking agent to forcibly press the child's body, in order not to cause fractures.
Treatment of abdominal distention. Abdominal distention often occurs in children with pneumonia, leading to children feeling uncomfortable and unrest, which hinders normal breathing. A hot water bag was placed on the abdomen, to facilitate venting. Anal venting was also used and children became quiet after venting. If abdominal distention did not improve, it suggested the presence of toxic intestinal paralysis, and a poor prognosis.
Anti-infective therapy. After a clear diagnosis of severe pneumonia, collecting blood for bacterial culture and sensitivity test was performed prior to the use of antibiotics when conditions permitted. A separate venous access for antibiotics was established as much as possible, to rationalize the use of antimicrobial drugs and avoid side effects. In principle, the application of antimicrobial drugs was carried out on the basis of evidence-based medicine, but a majority of them are classified as empirical treatment. As the therapeutic window of children with severe pneumonia was very small, the initial drugs for treatment covered an antibacterial spectrum as broad as possible, as well as all the pathogens. There were sufficient data displaying that the inappropriate choice of anti-infective drugs for initial therapy and untimely appropriate treatment (effective therapy of antigens) had adverse consequences on the prognosis. The main indicators of efficacy were a decrease in body temperature, improvement in poisoning symptoms and ability to drink water or conduct breast-feeding or food intake. In general, 3-5 days after the body temperature became stable, the drug dosage was reduced and gradually discontinued.
Intravenous injection of immune globulin is considered a safe and effective method for the treatment of children with severe pneumonia. It can rapidly improve immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the patient's blood; enhance the body's resistance to infection and immune function. By passively accepting lgG, the body acquires resistance to a variety of microbial infections. High-dose intravenous IgG infusion can increase the IgG concentration 3-to 6-fold in circulating blood compared to a normal person. Therefore it has the ability to prevent infections. Using IgG infusion concurrently with antibiotics can be used to treat bacterial infections and has a broad anti-bacterial and viral spectrum, as well as a dual function of anti-bacterial antigens and viral antigens.
In summary, positive and effective nursing can promote the rehabilitation of children patients, reduce the incidence of complications and children's mortality, thus play an important role in the rehabilitation of children with severe pneumonia. Psychological counseling may also be strengthened. Children feel a sense of inadaptation with regard to unfamiliar environment by instinct. They cried and even refused infusion in the face of examination and treatment by strangers. Therefore, nurses must be careful and gentle to children patients. For older children, they were able to explain to them the importance of the infusion and blood tests for the treatment of the disease, and increase their sense of trust in the medical staff. Health education is also essential, nurses should communicate more with parents and acquaint them with relevant knowledge and inform them regarding the prevention and treatment of diseases, such as that children usually need to do exercise, enhance nutrition, bask more in sunshine and engage in outdoor activities, ensure adequate sleep, pay attention to personal health, and get vaccinated for the prevention of pneumonia and influenza if necessary.",Emergency treatment and nursing of children with severe pneumonia complicated by heart failure and respiratory failure: 10 case reports,"Li, Wanli; An, Xinjiang; Fu, Mingyu; Li, Chunli",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5038202/,219,3193,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,fef7a8f796c4068d359d7b65f03ddba1841d1738,"Recoding' is a term used to describe non-standard read-out of the genetic code, and encompasses such phenomena as programmed ribosomal frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, selenocysteine insertion and translational bypassing. Although only a small proportion of genes utilize recoding in protein synthesis, accurate annotation of 'recoded' genes lags far behind annotation of 'standard' genes. In order to address this issue, provide a service to researchers in the field, and offer training data for developers of gene-annotation software, we have gathered together known cases of recoding within the Recode database. Recode-2 is an improved and updated version of the database. It provides access to detailed information on genes known to utilize translational recoding and allows complex search queries, browsing of recoding data and enhanced visualization of annotated sequence elements. At present, the Recode-2 database stores information on approximately 1500 genes that are known to utilize recoding in their expression-a factor of approximately three increase over the previous version of the database. Recode-2 is available at","The term 'translational recoding' describes the utilization of non-standard decoding during protein synthesis and encompasses such processes as ribosomal frameshifting, codon redefinition, translational bypassing and StopGo (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . What is often considered as a decoding error-e.g. a frameshifting error or mistranslation of a particular codon-may occasionally benefit the organism by increasing its fitness and survival. In such instances the propensity for the decoding 'error' may be selected for during evolution, leading to the formation of a particular sequence context that elevates the frequency of the 'error'. To discriminate such cases of programmed decoding 'misbehaviour' from promiscuous translational errors or translational noise, the term recoding is used. The position within an mRNA where a recoding event takes place is termed the 'recoding site'. Sequence elements responsible for increasing the efficiency of recoding events are termed 'recoding stimulatory signals', and a minimal sequence fragment that allows recoding to take place at the natural efficiency (i.e. relative to the level of standard decoding at the recoding site) is termed a 'recoding cassette'.
Recoding can benefit gene expression in a number of ways. It can regulate gene expression by being part of a sensor for particular cellular conditions. Prominent examples include ribosomal frameshifting in bacterial release factor 2 (RF2) and eukaryotic antizyme mRNAs. In both instances, ribosomal frameshifting is required for the production of the corresponding active full-length protein products. In the RF2 mRNA, the efficiency of frameshifting is negatively regulated by the cellular concentration of its product, RF2, providing an autoregulatory circuit for its biosynthesis (8) (9) (10) . In the antizyme mRNA, the efficiency of frameshifting is modulated by cellular levels of polyamines, whose concentration in turn is controlled by antizyme (11, 12) . Thus, this mechanism ensures the maintenance of antizyme production at the levels required to support physiologically appropriate concentrations of polyamines. Recoding can also be used for the diversification of protein products encoded by a single gene. An illustrative example is in bacterial dnaX mRNA, where frameshifting allows synthesis of two different protein subunits-sharing the same N-terminal part-from a single open reading frame (ORF) in its mRNA (13) (14) (15) . A presumed constant ratio of frameshifting in dnaX ensures a fixed stoichiometric balance between these two subunits (16) . This balance, then, is independent of the absolute levels of dnaX transcription and translational initiation on its mRNA. Similarly, in many viruses recoding is responsible for setting a ratio between protein products (such as those encoded by gag-pro-pol genes in retroviruses) produced from a single mRNA (17) . Recoding also provides RNA viruses with a mechanism for the translation of downstream ORFs on polycistronic RNAs [other mechanisms include leaky scanning, shunting, reinitiation, IRESs and the production of subgenomic RNAs (18) ] and may also be involved in global regulation mechanisms, such as mediating the switch between translation and replication on the same genomic RNA (19) . Finally, recoding provides a way for the incorporation of non-standard amino acids-e.g. amino acids that share their codons with termination signals (the most prominent example of which is selenocysteine, encoded by UGA) (20) (21) (22) . For further information on the diverse variety of recoding functions, see recent reviews (1, 3, 7, 23, 24) .
Recoding cassettes may be composed of a variety of diverse sequence elements. For example, primary nucleotide sequences may promote re-arrangements of tRNA molecules relative to their codons in mRNA inside the ribosome or affect recognition of tRNAs or release factors in the ribosomal A-site. On the other hand, many recoding signals act in the form of RNA secondary structures, such as simple stem-loops, or more complex pseudoknots, kissing stem-loops and other structures that involve interactions between considerably distant RNA regions (19, (25) (26) (27) (28) . Trans-acting RNA signals affecting ribosomal decoding through complementary interactions with ribosomal RNA (29-32), or through the nascent peptide acting within the ribosome exit tunnel (6, 33, 34) , are also known. Some recoding events-such as selenocysteine insertion-require the presence of additional specialized machinery such as selenocysteine tRNAs, selenocysteine-specific translation factors and several other components of the selenocysteine biosynthesis and insertion pathway (20, (35) (36) (37) . Recent reviews on stimulatory signals involved in the modulation of recoding events and molecular mechanisms of recoding provide further details (7, 25, 27, 38, 39) .
Despite considerable progress in the development of computational tools for the prediction of protein coding genes in sequenced genomes, the identification and annotation of recoded genes lags far behind. The hurdle lies not so much in the fact that recoded genes do not obey standard rules of genetic readout but, rather, in the considerable diversity of recoded genes and sequence elements responsible for recoding. Even among evolutionarily related genes, all utilizing recoding, the diversity of recoding signals can be considerable. An extreme example is when orthologous genes utilize recoding at different stages of gene expression to achieve the same goal. An example is in dnaX, where ribosomal frameshifting is employed by enterobacteria, but transcriptional slippage is used in Thermus thermophilus (40) . A similar situation occurs in bacterial insertion sequence (IS) elements, where a certain group of IS elements utilizes transcriptional slippage to produce ORFA-ORFB fusions, while many other IS elements utilize ribosomal frameshifting for the same purpose (41) . The diversity of recoding functions, combined with the wide spectrum of unrelated sequence elements involved in recoding, makes the design of a uniform model of recoding intractable. Nonetheless, in recent years, we have witnessed the development of specialized models and computational tools for the identification of particular subsets of recoding cassettes, or tools that are specific to recoding events in particular groups of homologous genes (42) (43) (44) (45) .
These developments, at least partially, were facilitated by the availability of a compiled dataset of known recoded genes collected together in the Recode database (http://recode.genetics.utah.edu), which was initially launched 9 years ago (46, 47) . To facilitate further development of computational tools for the prediction of recoded genes in the ever faster growing body of sequence data, as well as to provide bench researchers with upto-date information on recoding, an efficient means of Recode database population and annotation are now required. In this article, we describe the incarnation of the database, Recode-2. The major advances of Recode-2 (hosted in a new location http://recode.ucc.ie) over previous versions include a new web design allowing enhanced visualization of stimulatory signals, a uniform RecodeML format for the annotation of recoded genes, and a significantly larger number of entriesincluding many recently identified cases-that altogether have more than doubled the size of the database since its last published update.
The data are stored in a local PostgreSQL database that is queried by PHP scripts embedded in the web interface. The schema of the PostgreSQL database is shown in Figure 1 . The database stores information on individual genes that utilize recoding, the mechanisms and stimulatory signals involved, and references to the original literature sources that describe the recoding events. In order to facilitate the uniform annotation of recoding events, we have designed an XML-based format for the annotation of recoded genes, RecodeML. The document type definition for RecodeML is available at the Recode-2 web site at http://recode.ucc.ie/dtd The extensibility of the RecodeML format will allow incorporation of new annotation, if required, for newly discovered types of recoding, and the associated features, as they are being discovered. The database handles batch importation of properly designed RecodeML entries into the PostgreSQL database, thus facilitating rapid population of the database with new data.
The data in the database may be explored in two ways. They may be browsed by one of the three categories: kingdom (archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses), organism and type of recoding. The data may also be searched directly by key words that can be inserted into the search field. Searches that use regular expressions are allowed. The output of a database search is a list of Recode-2 entries in a short format that includes organism name, kingdom, genus, type of recoding event, status of Figure 2 shows an example of sequence annotation for the human oaz1 gene, alongside a diagram of a stimulatory RNA secondary structure, and the Recode-1 logo.
Unlike Recode-1, where all data on recoding events were introduced manually, Recode-2 also utilizes automated identification of recoding events by the recently developed computer programs ARFA (43) and OAF (44) , that are able to identify and annotate +1 frameshifting events in mRNAs of bacterial RF2s and eukaryotic antizyme (OAZs), respectively. However, a significant source of recoding events remains to be serendipitous discoveries by experimental studies that sometimes are complemented by more systematic studies of large groups of similar genes (51, 52) . Therefore, a large proportion of new data are still populated manually or semi-manually. To ease manual population of recoding events, a special form has been designed that is available in the database upon user registration. User registration needs to be approved by one of the database contributors. The novel data in the database include 249 RF2 mRNAs identified by ARFA, 152 events identified by OAF, 200 new selenoprotein genes (53) (54) (55) (56) and 200 new viral annotations (57) including the newly discovered frameshift cassettes in potyviruses (58), alphaviruses (59) and the Japanese encephalitis group of flaviviruses (60) .
The database will expand in accordance with the growth of available sequence information that will be scanned by one of the existing programs for recode annotation.
We also plan to continue developing tools for the automatic identification of recoding events from nucleotide sequences. As the field grows and the number of recoded genes progressively increases, it becomes harder to extract data from the relevant literature and a number of novel recoded genes may escape the database. Therefore, we encourage users and researchers in the field to submit their data directly to the Recode-2 database. We are also willing to provide help with the analysis of potential new recoding events.","Recode-2: new design, new search tools, and many more genes","Bekaert, Michaël; Firth, Andrew E.; Zhang, Yan; Gladyshev, Vadim N.; Atkins, John F.; Baranov, Pavel V.",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808893/,163,1652,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,760fa9225c5f571c77674f53a1f2d9648eb2adb0,"Background: Acute-phase proteins (APPs) are sensitive markers of inflammation, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) recently has been shown to be a useful diagnostic marker in dogs with bacterial pneumonia (BP). In humans with community-acquired pneumonia, APPs also have great utility as follow-up markers aiding in the assessment of treatment response.
Objectives: The aim of our study was to investigate the applicability of APPs as markers of treatment response in dogs with BP.
Animals: Nineteen dogs diagnosed with BP and 64 healthy dogs. Methods: The study was conducted as a prospective longitudinal observational study. Serum CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA), and haptoglobin concentrations were followed during a natural course of BP. Normalization of serum CRP was used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment (treatment was stopped 5-7 days after CRP normalized) in 8 of 17 dogs surviving to discharge; 9 of 17 dogs were treated according to conventional recommendations.
Results: All measured APPs initially were significantly increased, but the magnitude of increase was not correlated to disease severity. C-reactive protein and SAA concentrations decreased rapidly after initiation of antimicrobial treatment. When normalization of serum CRP was used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment, treatment duration was significantly (P = .015) decreased without increasing the number of relapses.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Serum CRP and SAA reflected the recovery process well and therefore may be used as markers of treatment response. According to the results, the normalization of serum CRP may be used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment in dogs with BP.","B acterial pneumonia (BP) is an acquired inflammation of the lower airways and lung parenchyma secondary to bacterial infection. 1 The clinical characteristics and microbiological findings in dogs with BP have been well described. [2] [3] [4] [5] However, information concerning the normalization of clinical and radiographic findings during the recovery process and guidelines on assessing the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in BP still are limited. 1, 6, 7 Acute-phase proteins (APPs) are a group of blood proteins, mainly produced by the liver, which are part of the innate host defense system. 8 The APPs are involved in the protection against infection as well as in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation, especially in the early phases of injury. 9 The major positive APPs in dogs, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), have low serum concentrations in healthy dogs. Serum concentrations of CRP and SAA increase markedly within the first hours after inflammatory stimuli and normalize quickly during the recovery period. 9 The APPs have certain advantages in disease monitoring compared to the CBC. The numbers of blood leukocytes are largely affected by extravasation into the pulmonary parenchyma during acute BP, whereas APPs increase consistently with increasing inflammatory stimuli. 9 Minor and moderate positive APPs, such as haptoglobin (Hp), show a more gradual increase and decrease during the acute-phase response (APR). 8 The production of other plasma proteins, socalled negative APPs (such as albumin and transferrin), decreases during the APR. 8 Being nonspecific biomarkers of inflammation, increased serum concentrations of CRP, SAA, and Hp have been observed in dogs with a variety of infectious, immune-mediated and neoplastic diseases. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Despite the nonspecific nature of APPs, serum CRP can be useful in discriminating disease processes such as BP from other pulmonary diseases. 18 The APPs have been shown to decrease after initiation of successful treatment. 16, [19] [20] [21] Additionally, the increase in serum CRP during long-term follow-up in dogs with leishmaniasis and immune-mediated polyarthritis predicts the relapse of clinical disease. 14, 21 The utilization of CRP and SAA as possible prognostic biomarkers also has been studied in dogs, and most studies concluded that serum CRP or SAA concentrations at presentation could not predict clinical outcome. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] However, persistent increases in serum CRP after 48-72 hours of treatment were correlated with poor outcome. [22] [23] [24] Serum CRP has been widely studied in humans with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and its use as a diagnostic and follow-up biomarker is recommended by current treatment guidelines. 27, 28 Bacterial pneumonia currently is treated with markedly longer antimicrobial courses than is CAP, and effective means to estimate optimal treatment duration are lacking. 1, 6, 7, 29 Biomarker-guided antimicrobial treatment has been studied in humans with CAP by procalcitonin (PCT), a novel inflammatory biomarker, which indicated that PCT-guided antibiotic use decreased the duration of antimicrobial treatment without increasing the incidence of complications. [30] [31] [32] Similar studies assessing CRP-guided antimicrobial use in humans with CAP are lacking, but serum CRP has been shown to be useful in decreasing the duration of antimicrobial treatment in humans with neonatal septicemia without increasing the incidence of complications. 33, 34 The aim of our study was to describe the changes in clinical variables, thoracic radiographs, and APPs during a natural course of BP in dogs as well as comparing these variables between dogs with less severe BP requiring <2 days of hospitalization (lsBP) and more severe BP requiring >2 days of hospitalization (msBP). Additionally, the purpose of our study was to provide information concerning the application of APPs in the assessment of treatment response and to investigate whether serum CRP measurements can aid in the estimation of antimicrobial treatment duration in dogs with BP.
This study was conducted as a prospective longitudinal observational study.
Privately owned dogs diagnosed with BP between March 2011 and December 2012 at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Helsinki were eligible for inclusion in the study. Dogs with known or suspected concurrent infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic diseases capable of increasing APP concentrations were excluded from the study. Dogs with known excess endogenous glucocorticoids or glucocorticoid medication <4 weeks before BP were excluded from the Hp measurements. 35, 36 Pregnant or lactating bitches and puppies <3 months of age also were excluded. 37 Privately owned blood donor dogs were recruited as healthy controls for the APP measurements. These dogs had no signs of illness and had a normal physical examination findings as well as normal hematology and biochemistry findings.
A full clinical examination was performed, and thoracic radiographs as well as blood, fecal, and respiratory samples were obtained at presentation as previously described. 18 Thoracic radiographs were assessed by the same radiologist (AKL), who was blinded to the patient data. Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed when typical acute signs (at least 3 of the following: fever, lethargy, dyspnea, tachypnea, cough) were observed and thoracic radiograph findings were compatible with BP (ie, an alveolar pattern or a moderate or severe bronchointerstitial or interstitial pattern). 2,3,6 A bacterial origin was demonstrated by respiratory cytology or bacterial culture as previously described. 18 A postmortem examination was performed on dogs that died or were euthanized during hospitalization, to confirm the diagnosis of BP.
After initial examination, dogs were examined daily during hospitalization (clinical examination and individually chosen methods including blood tests, thoracic imaging, or both) and at follow-up visits at 7-to 10-day intervals after discharge. The last follow-up visit was scheduled 2 weeks after antimicrobial treatment had concluded. A clinical examination was performed during the followup visits, and blood samples for hematology, APP measurements, and arterial blood gas analysis were obtained and thoracic radiographs were repeated. Owners were contacted 4-8 weeks after the last follow-up visit to obtain information on possible relapses.
Initially, antimicrobial treatment was chosen empirically to cover the most common causative organisms in BP. Later, when bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility results were available, the treatment regimen was re-evaluated, and if necessary, changes were made according to the culture results. During hospitalization, antimicrobials were administrated IV, and PO treatment was continued after discharge. Dogs were discharged when they did not require oxygen supplementation and were capable of maintaining normal hydration and nutrition PO. At the beginning of the trial, the duration of antimicrobial treatment followed conventional recommendations, and dogs were treated for 3-6 weeks or 1-2 weeks beyond the resolution of alveolar density on the thoracic radiographs. 1, 6 Antimicrobial treatment of dogs entering our study during 2012 was discontinued 5-7 days after serum CRP returned to normal (<25 mg/L). Antibiotic treatment was discontinued by the CRP-guided approach only when owners consented.
Hematology, serum biochemistry, arterial blood gas analysis, blood cultures, and fecal analysis along with cytological and microbiological analysis of respiratory samples were performed as previously described. 18 Coagulation parameters prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were evaluated with commercial test kits for dogs, a,b . Serum samples obtained for APP analysis either were immediately analyzed or stored at À80°C until analyzed. [38] [39] [40] CRP was analyzed by magnetic permeability-based immunoassay c validated for dogs. 41 Creactive protein values below the detection limit for the CRP assay (<10 mg/L) were set at 5 mg/L. Results above the upper detection limit for the assay (>210 mg/L) were set at 211 mg/L. A CRP ratio (CRP concentrations at 24, 48, and 72 hour divided by the initial concentration), describing the decrease in CRP during early recovery, was calculated after initiation of treatment in dogs with samples available for the time point in question. Samples for SAA analysis were sent on dry ice to an external laboratory d and measured by an automated e latex agglutination test f validated for dogs. 42 Haptoglobin was measured by a commercial colorimetric method g validated for dogs. 43 
Normality testing was performed by Shapiro-Wilk's test of normality and normal Q-Q plots. The differences between dogs with lsBP and msBP as well as between dogs with Escherichia coliinduced BP and BP caused by other organisms were evaluated by the independent samples Student's t-test (normally distributed variables) and Mann-Whitney U-test (non-normally distributed variables). The Mann-Whitney U-test also was used to evaluate whether there were differences in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and transtracheal wash (TTW) fluid differential cell counts and whether the duration of antimicrobial treatment differed in dogs with CRP-guided and conventional treatment. Initial serum CRP, SAA, Hp, and albumin concentrations were compared among groups of healthy dogs as well as dogs with <2 days and >2 days of hospitalization by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Bonferroni correction was used in the pairwise comparisons to control for the family-wise error rate.
The correlation between serum APPs and clinical variables (body temperature, respiratory rate, partial pressures of arterial oxygen [PaO 2 ] and carbon dioxide [PaCO 2 ], alveolar-arterial gradient [A-aO 2 ], blood leukocyte parameters, and BALF cytology as well as duration of clinical signs and duration of hospitalization) was assessed with Spearman's correlation coefficients. P-values < .05 were considered statistically significant.
The mean curves (Fig 2A-D) were calculated with randomeffects analysis of variance regression models (ANOVA). For CRP and SAA, a logarithmic transformation was computed to normalize the distribution and the fitted values estimated from the models were transformed back to original scale to represent the geometric mean of the response in time. For Hp and PaO 2 , the absolute values were used as the response, and the mean curves computed directly from the fitted values. As explanatory variables, the models included the fixed effects of group, day and the 2-way interaction of group 9 day, and random effects of dog and dog 9 day. All statistical analyses were performed by commercial statistical software h,i,j .
This study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Helsinki. Owner consent was obtained from owners of the dogs before participation.
Nineteen dogs diagnosed with BP were included, and 64 privately owned healthy blood donor dogs were chosen as controls for the APP measurements. Age, body weight, and sex distribution of dogs participating in our study are presented in Table 1 . The dogs represented various breeds without overrepresentation of any single breed.
All dogs were presented as acute emergency cases of varying severity. Fifteen of 19 dogs required hospitalization. One dog died as a consequence of severe BP despite the fact that the bacteria isolated were susceptible to the antibiotics used. One dog was euthanized as a consequence of refractory BP caused by a multiresistant E. coli. None of the owners refused hospitalization or selected euthanasia for financial reasons.
Concurrent disease processes possibly predisposing to the development of BP were identified in 6 of 19 dogs (parainfluenza or respiratory corona virus infection [5/6] , 44 advanced chronic bronchitis [1/6]). Table 1 . Microbiological findings of respiratory samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid n = 11, transtracheal wash fluid n = 5, transthoracic fine-needle aspiration n = 2, and fresh sputum sample n = 1) and blood cultures in dogs with bacterial pneumonia (n = 19). 
Clinical data as well as duration of clinical signs and hospitalization are presented in Table 1 . Fecal analyses were available for 15 of 19 dogs, and each sample was negative for lungworms and intestinal parasites. Prothrombin time and aPTT were measured in 8 of 19 dogs on 15 different occasions either at presentation or during hospitalization. Prothrombin time was normal in all measurements. Mildly prolonged aPTT was noted in 3 of 8 dogs. In all 3 dogs, E. coli was detected in respiratory samples. One of these dogs was hospitalized for 5 days; 2 did not survive to hospital discharge.
Serum CRP, SAA, and Hp concentrations are presented in Figure 1A 
An alveolar lung pattern was detected in 15 of 19 dogs, involving a single lobe in 5 of 15 dogs and multiple lobes in 9 of 15 dogs. A patchy alveolar pattern involving several lobes was found in 1 dog. The cranial (12/15) and middle (7/15) lobes most often were affected. A moderate-to-severe interstitial or bronchointerstitial lung pattern was identified in 4 of 19 dogs at presentation. An alveolar pattern in multiple lobes at presentation was detected in 4 of 10 dogs with lsBP and in 6 of 9 dogs with msBP.
The alveolar pattern found in 13 of 17 dogs was resolved in a median of 10 days (IQR, 8-15 days), and 9 of 13 dogs had cleared alveolar infiltrates by day 10. At a follow-up visit 2 weeks after discontinuation of antibiotics, 15 of 17 dogs still had a mild-to-moderate bronchial, bronchointerstitial, or interstitial patterns on thoracic radiographs.
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was retrieved in 11 of 19, and TTW was performed in 5 of 19. When BAL or TTW were not available (mainly due to the small size of the patient or the severity of BP), a transthoracic aspirate (TTA) was collected in 2 of 19 and a fresh sputum sample in 1 of 19 dogs. Microbiological analysis was performed in all dogs and the results are presented in Table 1 . A cytological analysis was performed in 18 of 19 dogs (cytology was not performed in 1 TTW sample). Results from the cytology analyses are presented in Table 2 . Because BALF and TTW fluid cytology did not differ significantly in other cell percentages apart from the percentage of epithelial cells (median in BALF, 0.0; IQR, 0.0-0.0 versus median in TTW fluid, 7.1; IQR, 0.2-16.1; P = .026), combined results are presented for the 2 sampling techniques. Cytology in TTA (n = 2) and fresh sputum (n = 1) samples consisted of markedly increased numbers of neutrophils and intracellular bacteria, and an abundant bacterial growth was detected in these samples. The diagnosis of BP was additionally confirmed by postmortem examination in 1 dog with sputum sampling and in 1 dog with TTA sampling.
Dogs with E. coli as a causative agent required significantly (P = .049) longer hospitalization (median, 4.5 days; range, 3.5-5.5) compared to dogs with other causative bacteria (median, 1.0 days; range, 0.5-14.0) and 2 of 4 dogs with E. coli-induced BP died or were euthanized because of disease severity.
Of the 17 dogs surviving to discharge, 9 received antibiotics according to conventional recommendations (median duration of treatment, 35 days; IQR, 29-48 days) and CRP was not used for determining the duration of the treatment. Less severe BP and msBP were observed in 6 of 9 and 3 of 9 of these dogs, respectively. Antimicrobial treatment was discontinued 5-7 days after CRP normalization in 8 of 17 dogs (median duration of treatment, 21 days; IQR, 19-29 days). Less severe BP and msBP were observed in 4 of 8 and 4 of 8 of these dogs, respectively. Treatment guided by CRP (median, 21 days) was significantly shorter (P = .015) than conventional treatment (median, 35 days). Sixteen of 17 dogs did not have clinical signs or findings suggestive of BP relapse at follow-up visits 2 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation or during follow-up phone calls 4-8 weeks after the follow-up visit. One dog treated conventionally had a relapse of BP after antibiotic discontinuation, and Cushing's disease was later found as a predisposing factor. Bacteria susceptible to the initially chosen antimicrobials were detected in 15 of 17 dogs. In 2 dogs, bacterial growth was not detected and therefore antimicrobial susceptibility could not be addressed. Of these 2 dogs, 1 was treated according to conventional recommendations and 1 was treated by CRP guidance.
All measured positive APPs were significantly increased in dogs with BP at presentation compared to healthy controls. This finding is in agreement with previous reports describing CRP and SAA in dogs with BP. 10, 18, 45 Haptoglobin concentrations have not been reported previously, but because significant increases in serum Hp have been reported 24 hours after an inflammatory stimulus, increased concentrations also were expected in BP. 9 However, it must be emphasized that APPs are highly nonspecific inflammatory markers and, in addition to BP, increased concentrations may be encountered in a variety of disease processes. 8, 9 As expected, all positive APPs (CRP, SAA, Hp) correlated positively with each other. However, a negative correlation with albumin did not occur in all comparisons. This is most likely due to the long half-life of albumin, resulting in a late response not noticeable in acute BP. 9 Serum APP concentrations at presentation did not differ significantly in dogs with lsBP and msBP. Additionally, serum CRP, SAA, or Hp at presentation did not correlate significantly with markers of disease severity, such as arterial PaO 2 and the duration of hospitalization. Initial serum CRP, SAA, or Hp concentrations in dogs with BP therefore may not be useful indicators of disease severity. A similar observation has been made in studies describing CRP in human patients with CAP. 46, 47 C-reactive protein and SAA rapidly decreased after initiation of treatment (Fig 2A,B) . These findings indicate that CRP and SAA are useful markers of treatment response. Haptoglobin showed a more gradual increase and decrease and therefore did not reflect clinical recovery as well as CRP and SAA. Because there is a wider range of concentrations and the magnitude of change is more pronounced in SAA compared to CRP, SAA might be a better diagnostic and follow-up marker than CRP in dogs with BP, as already suggested by a recent study comparing CRP and SAA as diagnostic markers of systemic inflammation. 45 Healthy < 2d hosp. > 2d hosp. C-reactive protein continued to increase within the first 24 hours in 5 dogs. This is not unexpected because dogs with BP were presented acutely and CRP is known to reach peak concentrations approximately 24 hours after the onset of an inflammatory stimulus. 48 Consequently, it is not meaningful to interpret the possible CRP decrease as early as 24 hours after initiation of treatment. However, a decrease in serum CRP is expected 48-72 hours after initiation of successful treatment, and a failure to show a decrease has been associated with a poor prognosis in dogs with systemic inflammatory conditions. [22] [23] [24] Consecutive measurements of CRP have been to be found useful in humans with CAP, and the magnitude of CRP decrease at days 3 and 4 has been shown to have prognostic value. 49-51 A connection also has been shown between the pattern of serum CRP concentrations and outcome in humans. Patients with persistently high CRP (so-called nonresponse) or an increase in serum CRP after an initial decrease (so-called biphasic response) during the first days of hospitalization had a poor prognosis. 52 In our study, the CRP ratio, describing the magnitude of decrease after 48 or 72 hours, did not correlate with the duration of hospitalization. This finding could be a consequence of the small number of samples available for CRP measurement at 72 hours: Only 5 dogs with msBP were still alive and hospitalized 72 hours after presentation. Another limitation concerns the method used for CRP measurements. The upper detection limit for the assay used was 210 mg/L, and measurements exceeding this concentration were set at 211 mg/L. Doing so underestimated the increase in serum CRP, because it has been shown that serum CRP can increase markedly above 211 mg/L in dogs with aspiration pneumonia. 45 This approach will affect the interpretation of the CRP ratio during the recovery process. These limitations make the interpretation of the CRP ratio in our study less informative. One dog, which was euthanized because of refractory BP, had a biphasic CRP response pattern similar to that described in connection with poor prognosis in humans with CAP. 52 Regarding other variables, dogs with msBP were characterized by a more pronounced left shift and lymphopenia and were significantly more hypoxemic. Respiratory samples in dogs with msBP were characterized by significantly more pronounced neutrophilia, eosinopenia, and lymphopenia compared to dogs with lsBP. These variables therefore could be useful as early markers aiding in the identification of dogs with a more severe course of BP. Escherichia coli as a causative agent additionally was correlated with a more severe course of BP. Moreover, coagulation abnormalities were detected only in dogs with msBP caused by E. coli. These findings likely are due to endotoxin produced by E. coli, affecting hemodynamics, blood clotting, and cellular and humoral immunity. 53 A similar finding of increased disease severity has been described in E. coli-induced CAP. 54 Additionally, prolonged aPTT has been correlated with a worse prognosis in both humans and dogs with systemic inflammation or sepsis. 55, 56 Initial radiographic findings were consistent with previously reported findings in dogs with BP. 2, 3 The resolution of the alveolar lung pattern was followed during hospitalization and follow-up visits. However, because thoracic radiographs were not repeated daily, an exact time point for the resolution could not be determined. Alveolar infiltrates resolved relatively rapidly in our study (69% of dogs had cleared alveolar infiltrates by day 10) compared to studies of humans. Only 33% of human patients with CAP had clearance of radiographic Table 2 . Comparison of demographic, clinical, and respiratory cytology findings at presentation in dogs with less severe bacterial pneumonia (BP) (requiring <2 days of hospitalization, n = 10) and more severe BP (requiring >2 days of hospitalization, n = 9, including 2 mortalities). infiltrates at day 7 and 62% at day 28, and it also has been shown that radiographic normalization lags behind clinical cure as assessed by physicians. 57, 58 With CAP, current research has not been able to show benefits for routinely repeating thoracic radiographs after clinical recovery. [57] [58] [59] Repeating thoracic radiographs during and after hospitalization therefore is not recommended in patients with uncomplicated recovery. 27 Additional information gained by thoracic radiographs, especially after the clearance of alveolar infiltrates, was minimal in our study in dogs with otherwise satisfactory clinical recovery. Antimicrobial treatment currently is recommended for 3-6 weeks or 1-2 weeks beyond the resolution of radiographic changes. 1, 6, 7 Markedly shorter antimicrobial courses are used in CAP. Antibiotics are recommended for 7-10 days in cases of mild-to-moderate CAP, and the use of biomarkers has proved useful in determining optimal treatment duration. 27, [29] [30] [31] 33, 34, 60 No published clinical studies exist addressing the optimal duration of antimicrobials in dogs with BP, and current recommendations may overestimate the treatment duration needed, especially in uncomplicated cases. Considering the variety of infectious agents and the individual differences in the interactions between microbe and the host immune system, a need also exists in dogs with BP for customizing antibiotic treatment duration according to disease severity and response rate. In our study, normalization of CRP was used to guide duration of antimicrobial treatment in 8 of 17 dogs and resulted in significantly decreased treatment duration compared to 9 of 17 conventionally treated dogs. It would have been ideal to randomize the chosen treatment regimen and stratify the randomization according to disease severity. Instead, conventional treatment was used at the beginning of the study, because previous information on the applicability of CRP to predict treatment duration was lacking. When clinical experience was gained and serum CRP was found to reflect the recovery process well, it was considered safe to stop administering antibiotics after CRP normalization. Ending antimicrobials at the point of CRP normalization was still considered premature and, to increase safety, antimicrobials were administered for 5-7 days after CRP normalization. Relapses of BP were not noted in dogs receiving a CRP-guided course of antibiotics, and therefore, the approach appears to be safe. However, because the incidence of relapse was low in both groups, our study was not able to identify an optimal end point for antimicrobial treatment and even shorter courses than those used in the CRP-guided group may have been sufficient in dogs with BP. Additionally, the small number of dogs and lack of randomization are limitations, and larger randomized studies are warranted.
In conclusion, dogs with BP had significantly increased serum CRP, SAA, and Hp at presentation, and CRP and SAA decreased rapidly after initiation of treatment and reflected the recovery process well. When CRP normalization was used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment, treatment duration was significantly decreased without increasing the number of relapses.

Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various strategies employed by the virus to escape host immune surveillance. Here, we investigated the human antibody gene repertoires of uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals at genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels by deep sequencing followed by high-throughput sequence analysis to determine the frequencies of putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs).
Methods: Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using the gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All libraries were deep sequenced and sequences analysed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index. action). The frequencies of putative germline antibodies of known bnmAbs in the gDNA and cDNA libraries were determined.
The human gDNA antibody libraries were more diverse in heavy and light chain V-gene lineage usage than the cDNA libraries, indicating that the human gDNA antibody gene repertoires may have more potential than the cDNA repertoires to develop HIV-1 bnAbs. The frequencies of the heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions with identical V(D)J recombinations to known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low in human antibody gene repertoires. However, we found relatively high frequencies of the heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions that used the same V-genes and had the same CDR3 lengths as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of (D)J-gene usage. B-cells bearing B-cell receptors of such heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions may be stimulated to induce HIV-1 bnAbs.","Since the discovery of HIV-1 in the early 1980s, an effective HIV-1 vaccine that can elicit bnAbs has yet to be developed. Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various mechanisms for viral escape from human immune surveillance, including genetic alterations, oligomerization of envelope (Env) glycoproteins, We and others have demonstrated that known HIV-1 bnmAbs had uncommon properties compared with bnmAbs against other microbes, including extensive somatic maturation and lack of measurable binding activity of their putative germline antibodies to Envs [13, 15, 16, 18, 27, 28] , suggesting that HIV-1 infection or vaccination with HIV-1 Envs may not initiate the somatic maturation processes of the putative germline Abs to bnAbs. Deep sequencing of the cDNA-PCR products of memory B cells obtained from several 'elite controllers' at different time points postinfection further revealed the limited use of heavy chain V-gene (IGHV) lineages for developing HIV-1 bnAbs in a single infected individual [17, 18, 29] . The infrequency of developing bnAbs in natural infection, the uncommon properties of known HIV-1 bnmAbs, the confined usage of IGHV lineages for developing bnAbs in a single infected individual and the failure in inducing the same or similar bnmAbs by vaccine immunogens prompted us to investigate the human antibody gene repertoire for the availability of the putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 bnmAbs at both genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels and the possibility for existence of alternative germline antibody genes that may potentially mature to HIV-1 bnAbs. The gDNAs of peripheral B cells in uninfected human individuals presumably possess the initial rearranged antibody gene repertoire for affinity maturation upon infection or vaccination. We hypothesized that antibody gene repertoire at the gDNA level may be more diverse than that at the cDNA level. Therefore, we developed a methodology for constructing large combinatorial gDNA antibody libraries and constructed one large nonimmune gDNA library using the PMBCs obtained from 300 uninfected healthy humans and three immune gDNA libraries using the PBMCs obtained from three HIV-1-infected 'elite controllers'. Their corresponding cDNA libraries were simultaneously constructed. We compared the antibody gene repertoires of the four gDNA antibody libraries with those of the corresponding cDNA libraries by deep sequencing. Sequence analysis results suggest that the frequencies of the putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low, but alternative germline antibody genes may be explored to elicit HIV-1 bnAbs.
Preparation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells The PBMCs of healthy volunteers were obtained from The University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong, China). PBMCs from patient one (pt1) were obtained from Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Rockefeller University (New York, USA). PBMCs from patients 2 and 3 (pt2 and pt3) were obtained from National Center for AIDS/ STD Control and Prevention, China CDC (Beijing, China). All these experiments were approved by ethical committees of the respective institutes, and conducted according to local guidelines and regulations. All three patients were elite controllers. Pt1 was infected with clade B virus whose serum exhibited high titres of broadly neutralizing activity, and a panel of bnmAbs were isolated from pt1 PBMCs by single memory B-cell sorting using gp120 C-C core protein as a bait (pt1 in [18, 28] ). Pt2 and pt3 were infected with clade B' virus and naive to antiretroviral therapy [30] . The sera of pt2 and pt3 also exhibited cross-clade neutralization activity (data not shown). Heparinized whole blood samples were used to isolate human PBMCs by Ficoll density gradient separation.
Isolation of genomic DNA, total RNA and mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells Five to ten million PBMCs were collected from each 5 ml of heparinized whole blood and were used to isolate gDNA and total RNA using Allprep DNA/RNA Mini kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The gDNA was used as a template for amplification of heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions by semi-nested PCR for construction of gDNA antibody single chain antibody fragment (scFv) libraries in phagemid vector pComb3X. Total RNA from uninfected individual PBMCs were pooled and mRNA was prepared from the pooled total RNA using the 'Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit' (Qiagen). The mRNA was used to reverse transcribe cDNA for construction of cDNA antibody libraries.
Construction of genomic DNA antibody scFv libraries A total of 67 primers were designed and used in seminested PCR reactions to amplify heavy chain and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions using gDNA as a template, and in SOE-PCR to assemble scFvs for gDNA Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. scFv library construction (Table S1 , http://links.lww. com/QAD/A401). Reverse primers were mixed at equal molar concentrations prior to semi-nested PCRs. Each sense primer annealing to leader sequences or framework 1 (FR1) regions of heavy chain variable regions or kappa and lambda light chain variable regions was paired with the corresponding mixed antisense primers and used at the same final concentration (10 mmol/l) in the first or second round of PCRs. Each first round of PCR was carried out in a reaction volume of 100 ml containing 90 ng gDNA as a template by running the following PCR programme: initial denaturing at 958C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 458C for 30 s, 728C for 45 s, 20 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 558C for 30 s, 728C for 45 s and an extension cycle of 728C for 10 min. The second round of PCR was carried out using the corresponding first round PCR product as a template and running the following PCR programme: initial denaturing at 958C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 558C for 30 s, 728C for 30 s and an extension cycle of 728C for 10 min. Semi-nested PCR products were gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions were then covalently linked by a flexible (G4S)3 linker by SOE-PCR to assemble scFvs using the primer pairs Sfi5new/LINKR and LINKF/Sfi3hisR. The SOE-PCR products were gel-extracted, digested with SfiI and ligated to pComb3X. The ligated products were then electroporated into TG1 electrocompetent cells.
The pooled mRNA from the healthy donors' PBMCs and the mRNA from three elite controllers were used to reverse transcribe cDNA by using the 'SuperScript III cDNA Synthesis Kit'. The cDNA was used as a template to amplify heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chains by PCR using high-fidelity DNA polymerase and primers annealing to FR1s and FR4s of human antibody heavy chain variable regions and primers annealing to FR1s and constant regions of human antibody light chains (Table S2 , http://links.lww.com/ QAD/A401). The human antibody heavy chain first constant domain (CH1) sequence was then attached to the heavy chain variable regions by SOE-PCR to assemble Fds. Light chains and Fds were further assembled by SOE-PCR to obtain Fab fragments. The Fab fragments were then ligated to pComb3X, and the ligated products electroporated into TG1 electrocompetent cells.
Deep sequencing and sequence analysis Primers annealing to pComb3X vector or heavy and light chain constant regions (Table S1 and S2, http:// links.lww.com/QAD/A401) were used to amplify the scFvs from the gDNA antibody libraries and Fds and light chains from the cDNA antibody libraries. Gel-purified PCR products were sent for deep sequencing using the Roche 454 genome sequencer FLX. Trim sequences (!290 nt) were analysed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index.action).
Construction of large combinatorial DNA and cDNA antibody libraries We prepared the gDNAs from the PBMCs of 300 uninfected healthy donors and amplified the heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions by semi-nested PCR using pooled gDNA as a template and a set of primers that annealed to the leader sequence or framework 1 (FR1) or FR4 of each heavy chain or kappa and lambda light chain gene family (Table S1 , http://links.lww.com/QAD/A401). The heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions were then covalently linked by a flexible (G4S)3 linker by strand overlap extension (SOE)-PCR to assemble scFvs. The resultant combinatorial gDNA scFv library, including two sublibraries, designated NIgH/gK and NIgH/gL, in pComb3X contained over 600 million individual clones. Similarly, we constructed three immune gDNA scFv libraries using the gDNAs isolated from pt1, pt2 and pt3. Each immune gDNA scFv library had kappa and lambda sublibraries except that pt1 lambda sublibrary was omitted. Five sublibraries were designated pt1gH/gK, pt2gH/gK, pt2gH/gL, pt3gH/gK and pt3gH/gL, and each sublibrary contained one to six billion individual clones. We simultaneously constructed corresponding combinatorial cDNA antibody Fab libraries except that construction of a cDNA Fab library using pt1 PBMCs was omitted because the isolation of bnmAbs by single cell sorting of memory B-cells from pt1 PBMCs has been reported [18, 28] . The resultant nonimmune and immune cDNA Fab kappa and lambda sublibraries were designated NIH/NIK and NIH/NIL, pt2H/pt2K and pt2H/pt2L, and pt3H/pt3K and pt3H/pt3L, respectively. Each sublibrary contained 1-6 billion individual clones.
More diverse heavy chain V-gene lineage usage in the genomic DNA libraries than in the cDNA libraries We amplified the scFvs from the gDNA libraries and the Fds and light chains from the cDNA libraries using primers that annealed to the pComb3X vector or to the constant regions of heavy or light chains (CH1 and CL, respectively) (Table S1 and S2, http://links.lww. com/QAD/A401) and sent the PCR products for deep sequencing. We obtained trim sequences (>290 nt) from each library ranging from 23 530 to 88 331 for heavy chain variable regions, and from 17 285 to 28 110 for kappa light chain variable regions and from 21 480 to 30 199 for lambda light chain variable regions.

using various IGHVand IGKV/IGLV (kappa and lambda light chain V-genes) lineages in different gDNA and cDNA libraries, and the differences between the gDNA and corresponding cDNA libraries were more significant than those between the nonimmune and immune gDNA or cDNA libraries (Figs 1-3) . The gDNA libraries were more diverse overall than the cDNA libraries in using various IGHV lineages (Figs 1 and 2) . Among the four gDNA heavy chain libraries, NIgH and pt1gH showed a similar pattern of various IGHV lineage usage, whereas pt2gH and pt3gH were significantly different from NIgH and pt1gH in using IGHV1, IGHV2
and IGHV6 lineages (Figs 1 and 2) . Compared with the gDNA heavy chain libraries, the corresponding cDNA heavy chain libraries had significantly higher percentages of clones using IGHV1 and IGHV3 lineages (Fig. 1) , and were biased to certain VH1 and VH3 subfamilies, including IGHV1-18, 1-2 and 1-69, and IGHV 3-11, 3-21, 3-23, 3-30, 3-33, 3-49, 3-7 and 3-74 (Fig. 2) . The patterns of various IGKV/IGLV lineage usages in the nonimmune and immune gDNA libraries were similar except for pt1gK library (Figs 1 and 3) . The nonimmune and immune cDNA libraries also showed a similar pattern in using various IGKV/IGLV lineages. Both nonimmune and immune cDNA antibody libraries heavily used IGKV3 and IGLV1 lineages (Figs 1 and 3) . These results indicate that HIV-1 infection shapes the patterns of various IGHV lineage usages, but the caused changes at the cDNA level are much less significant compared with the changes at the gDNA level. The differences between the gDNA and cDNA antibody gene repertoires in HIV-1 uninfected (nonimmune) humans reflect host immune regulations, and such regulations may largely determine the host-dependent immune response to HIV-1 infection.
Extremely low frequency of the heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions with identical V(D)J recombinations to known HIV-1 bnmAbs To investigate the potential of basal human antibody gene repertoires to develop HIV-1 bnAbs, we analysed the trim heavy chain variable region sequences and counted the number of heavy chain variable regions that had identical putative VDJ recombinations to five known CD4 binding site bnmAbs b12, VRC01, VRC03, NIH45-46 and 3BNC60, and two glycan and loopspecific bnmAbs PG9 and pGT127. To our surprise, we found that the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions with identical putative VDJ recombinations to these known HIV-1 bnmAbs in both nonimmune and immune gDNA and cDNA libraries were extremely low (Table 1) . We did not find any heavy chain variable regions that had identical VDJ recombinations compared with the known bnmAbs in the nonimmune and three immune gDNA libraries (Table 1) . We found a total of five, 10 and two productive heavy chain variable regions (with in-frame junctions) in the cDNA libraries with exactly the same putative VDJ recombinations as VRC01, VRC03 and NIH45-46, respectively (Table 1) . However, their junction regions and the length of the HCDR3s were very different compared with the respective bnmAbs (data not shown), suggesting the unlikelihood for them to mature to VRC01-like bnAbs. We did a similar search for heavy chain variable regions that had identical VDJ recombinations to a nonneutralizing or weakly neutralizing CD4-induced (CD4i) mAb X5 and a bnmAb against SARS-CoV, m396 [31, 32] . We found four productive heavy chain variable regions in two immune gDNA libraries (1 in pt2gH and 3 in pt3gH) and a total of 28 productive heavy chain variable regions in the cDNA libraries (12 in NIH, 2 in pt2H and 14 in pt3H) that had identical putative VDJ recombinations to X5, but all these heavy chain variable regions had a shorter HCDR3 than that of X5 (24 amino acids, AA). We found one heavy chain variable region in pt1gH library and one heavy chain variable region in NIH library that had exactly the same putative VDJ recombination as IGHV1-18  IGHV1-2  IGHV1-24  IGHV1-3  IGHV1-45  IGHV1-46  IGHV1-58  IGHV1-69  IGHV1-8  IGHV1-c  IGHV1-f  IGHV1-NL1  IGHV2-10  IGHV2-26  IGHV2-5  IGHV2-70  IGHV3-11  IGHV3-13  IGHV3-15  IGHV3-16  IGHV3-19  IGHV3-20  IGHV3-21  IGHV3-22  IGHV3-23  IGHV3-25  IGHV3-30  IGHV3-30-3  IGHV3-33  IGHV3-35  IGHV3-38  IGHV3-43  IGHV3-47  IGHV3-48  IGHV3-49  IGHV3-52  IGHV3-53  IGHV3-54  IGHV3-62  IGHV3-64  IGHV3-66  IGHV3-7  IGHV3-71  IGHV3-72  IGHV3-73  IGHV3-74  IGHV3-9  IGHV3-d  IGHV3-h  IGHV3-NL1  IGHV4- IGKV1-12  IGKV1-13  IGKV1-16  IGKV1-17  IGKV1-27  IGKV1-33  IGKV1-37  IGKV1-39  IGKV1-5  IGKV1-6  IGKV1-8  IGKV1-9  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1-…  IGKV2-18  IGKV2-24  IGKV2-28  IGKV2-29  IGKV2-30  IGKV2-4  IGKV2-40  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV3-11  IGKV3-15  IGKV3-20  IGKV3-7  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3-…  IGKV3-…  IGKV3-…  IGKV3-…  IGKV3-…  IGKV4-1  IGKV5-2  IGKV6-21  IGKV6…  IGKV7-3   NIgK   pt1gK   pt2gK   pt3gK   0   5   10   15   20   25   30   35   40   IGKV1-12  IGKV1-13  IGKV1-16  IGKV1-17  IGKV1-27  IGKV1-33  IGKV1-37  IGKV1-39  IGKV1-5  IGKV1-6  IGKV1-8  IGKV1-9  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1…  IGKV1-…  IGKV2-18  IGKV2-24  IGKV2-28  IGKV2-29  IGKV2-30  IGKV2-4  IGKV2-40  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV2…  IGKV3-11  IGKV3-15  IGKV3-20  IGKV3-7  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3…  IGKV3- m396, but none of them had the same HCDR3 length as that of m396 (11 amino acids). These results indicate that the chance of having a heavy chain variable region with a defined VDJ recombination along with a specific HCDR3 length could be extremely low in human antibody gene repertoires.
The frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions that had the identical VJ recombinations to the known HIV-1 bnmAbs in both nonimmune and immune gDNA and cDNA libraries were also very low except that the frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombination to b12 kappa light chain variable region (IGKV3-20/IGKJ2) were relatively high (Table 1) . X5 used the same VJ recombination as b12, so the frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions with identical VJ recombination to X5 were also relatively high. Interestingly, we found that the frequencies of the lambda light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombinations to bnmAbs PG9 and PGT127 were also relatively high, whereas the frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombination to m396 were very low (Table 1) .
Relatively high frequencies of heavy and kappa/ lambda light chain variable regions that used the same or very similar heavy chain genes and kappa/lambda light chain V-genes and had the same length of CDR3s as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of (D)J-gene usage It is usually difficult to determine which D-gene and J-gene were recombined with the V-genes to generate heavy chain variable regions, owing to the complexity of VDJ recombination events. Therefore, we searched for productive heavy chain variable regions that used the same or very similar IGHVs and had the same length of HCDR3 as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of D-gene and J-gene usage. The frequencies of such heavy chain variables were relatively high in the nonimmune and immune gDNA and cDNA libraries than the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions with exactly the same VDJ recombinations of known HIV-1 bnmAbs except for VRC03, PG9 and PGT127 that had long HCDR3s (23, 30 and 25 amino acids, respectively) ( Table 2) . X5 also had a long HCDR3 (24 amino acids), so the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions that used the same or very similar IGHV of X5 and had the same HCDR3 length were not higher than the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions with exactly the same VDJ recombinations of X5. Similar analysis of trim kappa/lambda light chain variable regions also showed relatively high frequencies of the VKs/VLs that used the same or very similar IGKVs/IGLVs and had the same length of CDR3 as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of J-gene usage, especially for b12, PG9 and PGT127 (Table 2 ).

If a certain combination of putative germline heavy and light chains is required for HIV-1 bnAbs, the frequency of such germline antibody genes may be even lower. Compared with the lack of measurable binding of putative germline antibodies of known HIV-1 bnmAbs to Env and the requirement of extensive somatic maturation for broadly neutralizing activity [13, 27] , limited availability of B-cells bearing proper germline antibody genes that may mature to HIV-1 bnAbs upon stimulation may be a formidable challenge for developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine. The extremely low frequency of the putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 bnmAbs in the human antibody gene repertoires suggests that the approach for eliciting HIV-1 bnAbs by identifying primary immunogens to trigger the putative germline antibodies of known HIV-1 bnmAbs in vivo may have a very limited chance of success. However, our further sequence analyses revealed relatively high frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions in the human antibody gene repertoires that use the same or very similar IGHVs and IGKVs/IGLVs and have the same CDR3 length as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of (D)J-gene usage. B-cells harbouring such heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions may be stimulated to induce bnAbs. Note that we used the plasmids from the cDNA Fab libraries and the gDNA scFv libraries as templates for PCR amplification of the heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions for deep sequencing. The cDNA Fab libraries were constructed earlier and used in our previous studies. We did not convert the Fab libraries to scFv libraries because it was not necessary to do so. Conversion between two different formats of antibody libraries may cause loss of antibody diversity and result in bias to certain antibody gene families.
Exploring the human gDNA antibody gene repertoire may be another approach for eliciting HIV-1 bnAbs. As we hypothesized, the gDNA antibody gene repertoires showed more diverse usages of IGHV lineages than the cDNA repertoires. Indeed, we have isolated a panel of RSC3-specific antibodies from our combinatorial gDNA libraries, but not from the cDNA libraries (manuscript in preparation). The isolated RSC3-specific antibodies had no or very low levels of somatic maturation and used diverse V(D)J recombinations, but they competed with mature b12 and VRC01 for binding to engineered Env, RSC3 [13] , suggesting their potential to mature to VRC01-like bnAbs. We are currently doing in-vitro maturation and selection to confirm that they can potentially mature to VRC01-like bnAbs.
We obtained 33 436 and 80 331 trim heavy chain variable region sequences from 454 deep sequences of the nonimmune gDNA and cDNA libraries, respectively (Tables 1 and 2) , which were comparable to the theoretical maximum diversity of the basal human heavy chain variable gene repertoire (3.1 Â 10 4 ). The unequal usage of IGHV, IGHD and IGHJ genes in the nonimmune gDNA library suggests that VDJ recombination may not be a random event. The differences may be amplified by host immune regulations to remove or functionally silence B-cells expressing autoimmune antibodies or to deplete the B-cells that recognize B-cell superantigens [33] [34] [35] . This could lead to a different frequency of various germline antibody genes in the initial antibody gene repertoire for affinity maturation. For example, the heavy chain variable regions using IGHV1-2 or with HCDR3s of long length (20 amino acids and over) were significantly less frequent than the heavy chain variable regions using IGHV1-46 or with HCDR3s of medium length (10-15 amino acids) ( Fig. 2 and data not shown). Arnaout et al. [36] also showed that V, D and J segments were utilized with different frequencies, resulting in a highly skewed representation of VDJ combinations in the human antibody gene repertoire. However, they found that the pattern of segment usage was almost identical between two different individuals. Our result seems different from their finding. We found that IGHV lineage usage differs from individual to individual. In addition, they reported that IGHV1-2 lineage accounted for 2-3% sequence in nonimmune human antibody gene repertoire [36] . We found a similar percentage in our cDNA libraries, but the percentages of",The potential of the human immune system to develop broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies: implications for vaccine development,"Zhang, Yu; Yuan, Tingting; Li, Jingjing; Zhang, Yanyu; Xu, Jianqing; Shao, Yiming; Chen, Zhiwei; Zhang, Mei-Yun",AIDS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815086/,262,3712,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,711ffbd9492fb8100b4c89fea6842c38682e4410,"To assess relationships between xanthine oxidase (XOD) and nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) infection, 240 growing layers (35 days old) were randomly divided into two groups (infected and control) of 120 chickens each. Each chicken in the control and infected group was intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL sterile physiological saline and virus, respectively, after which serum antioxidant parameters and renal XOD mRNA expression in growing layers were evaluated at 8, 15 and 22 days post-inoculation (dpi). The results showed that serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in the infected group were significantly lower than in the control group at 8 and 15 dpi (p ＜ 0.01), while serum malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly higher (p ＜ 0.01). The serum uric acid was significantly higher than that of the control group at 15 dpi (p ＜ 0.01). In addition, the kidney mRNA transcript level and serum activity of XOD in the infected group was significantly higher than that of the control group at 8, 15 and 22 dpi (p ＜ 0.05). The results indicated that NIBV infection could cause the increases of renal XOD gene transcription and serum XOD activity, leading to hyperuricemia and reduction of antioxidants in the body.","Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can cause serious and highly contagious viral disease in chickens and has many serotypes or variants [34] . Nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) is one of the most prevalent viruses, exhibiting strong renal tropism and the potential to cause significant mortality to the poultry industry [12, 35] . Chickens of all ages may be infected, and infected chickens are characterized by coughing, depression, nasal discharge, sneezing, polyuria, and death [4, 25] . Clinicopathological studies reported that infection with NIBV can cause the kidneys of chickens to become swollen and pale, with deposition of monosodium urate crystals in tubules and ureters, resulting in visceral gout [14, 30] . Exacerbation of visceral gout may be associated with adverse metabolic, nutritional, or infectious conditions, and toxicity. Infections have become the most important cause of gout, and nephropathogenic strain of infectious bronchitis virus has become one of the most prevalent pathogens associated with the outbreak of visceral gout [11] .
Gout is a metabolic disorder, and hyperuricemia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for gout [10] . In poultry, avian gout is usually divided into visceral gout and articular gout. Former researchers have defined visceral gout as a disease induced by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in different internal organs that stimulate phagocytosis and initiate the inflammatory cascade [30] . Edwards [9] reported that elevated serum urate levels were closely associated with deposited urate crystals in intrarenal tissues. Uric acid, which is the ultimate decomposition product of endogenous or dietary purines in chickens, is generated by xanthine oxidase (XOD). Previous studies reported that increases in XOD activity were correlated with elevated serum urate levels [13] .
XOD is a molybdenum iron-sulfur flavin hydroxylase that is widely distributed in most animal species [8, 28] . Beedkar et al. [5] demonstrated that XOD was a vital mediator in the pathogenesis of human gout. In addition to the generation of uric acid, XOD can catalyze the substrate and concomitant generation of oxygen radicals, which can then induce tissue damage. There is mounting evidence that increased XOD activity is correlated with the development of many diseases due to the concomitantly increased production of uric acid and free radicals [6, 16] . However, to prevent tissue damage caused by oxidative stress, the major antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) played an important role in maintaining the balance between antioxidants and oxidation in vivo [17, 27] . Tas et al. [31] reported that increased activities of SOD and GSH-PX could reduce the oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rats. However, few studies have investigated the relationships among XOD, antioxidants and gout induced by NIBV. In the present study, chickens were infected with NIBV and changes in the renal XOD mRNA transcript level, serum XOD, serum uric acid and antioxidant levels were evaluated to clarify the dynamic characteristics of XOD and antioxidants in chickens after infection with NIBV.
A total of 280 1-day-old Hyline brown female chicks were obtained from a local hatchery (Nanchang, Jiangxi, China) and provided with a commercial chick starter diet prepared according to the National Research Council (USA) recommendations (NRC 1994) . At 35d of age, 240 apparently healthy Hyline brown hens were randomly allocated to infected and control groups and individually numbered. Each group contained three replicates, and there were 40 birds in each replicate. During the experiment, chicks were reared separately in two animal houses of the Animal Science and Technology School of Jiangxi Agricultural University and received feed and water ad libitum.
The nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus was preserved by the clinical veterinary science laboratory of Jiangxi Agricultural University. The virus was propagated in 10-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonating chicken eggs. Briefly, serial 10-fold dilutions (10 −1 to 10 −10 ) of the virus were prepared in sterile physiological saline and used to infect SPF embryonating chicken eggs. The 10 −5 embryo median lethal dose 50 was calculated according to the formula of Reed and Muench [26] . Each chicken in the infected group was intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL of 10 −5 median embryo infectious doses of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus at 35 days of age. Chickens in the control group were intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL of sterile physiological saline as virus-free controls. Chickens were examined daily for signs of infection after inoculation. Clinical signs were observed at 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) in most infected chickens. We then collected blood and organ samples at 8, 15 and 22 dpi (12 blood samples were collected from each group every time). Sera were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,500 × g, then stored at −20 o C for analysis. Organ samples (kidney) were individually collected into the freezing tubes and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, snap-frozen organs were stored at −80 o C immediately until RNA extraction. All experiments were conducted after institutional approval of the animal Care and Use Committee of Jiangxi Agricultural University.
The serum activities or concentrations of XOD, SOD, GSH-PX, uric acid (UA) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using commercially available kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Research Institute, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Total RNA was extracted from 12 individual chicken organs (12 kidneys) per group by homogenization in TranZol reagent (TransGen Biotech, China) using a homogenizer under low temperature according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was diluted in nuclease-free water, then quantified based on UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. The integrity of the extracted RNA was confirmed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Before reverse transcription reaction, all RNA samples were individually treated by Genomic DNA elimination reaction gene was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The primer and probe sequences are shown in Table 1 
All data were analyzed by SPSS (ver. 17.0; SPSS, USA). Data were determined to be normally distributed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between the control and the affected group were identified by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results were expressed as the means ± the standard deviation (SD). Data were considered statistically significant at p ＜ 0.05.
No clinical signs were observed in chickens in the control groups throughout the experimental period. However, various clinical signs were observed in chickens of the infected group at 6 dpi, such as depression, crouching and coughing. At 7 dpi, most of the chickens showed rales, coughing, head shaking and defecation of white excrement. At 8 dpi, severe diarrhea and death were observed in infected chickens. Overall, 28 of the infected chickens died after 8 dpi. Bilateral renal enlargement and deposits of pale urate were observed in the tubules and ureter upon postmortem examination of the dead pullets.
Figs. 1-3 show the serum XOD, GSH-PX and SOD activity in the infected group and control group at 8, 15 and 22 dpi, individually. At 8 and 15 dpi, the serum activity of XOD in the infected group had increased significantly when compared with the control group (p ＜ 0.01), and a significant increase was observed at 22 dpi (p ＜ 0.05; Fig. 1 ). GSH-PX and SOD activities were statistically lower than in the control group at 8 dpi and 15 dpi (p ＜ 0.01; GSH-PX, Fig. 2; SOD, Fig. 3 ). At 22 dpi, SOD and GSH-PX did not differ significantly, but a steadily decreasing trend between infected and control groups was observed.
The serum concentrations of UA and MDA are shown in Figs. 4-5. MDA was found to be significantly higher in the infected group than in the control group at 8 dpi (p ＜ 0.01; Fig. 4 ), while no significant difference was observed in UA (p ＞ 0.05; Fig. 5 ). At 15 dpi, the serum concentration of UA and MDA in the infected group was statistically higher than that of the control group (p ＜ 0.01). At 22 dpi, no significant difference was observed in UA and MDA between the infected and control group.
The levels of renal XOD mRNA transcription are shown in Fig. 6. At 8, 15 and 22 dpi, the transcript levels of XOD in the infected group had increased significantly relative to the control group (p ＜ 0.01).
XOD can oxidize a variety of purines, pyrimidines, pteridines, and other heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds while concomitantly generating UA, superoxide anion (O 2 − ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). It is well known that appropriate concentrations of UA and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are necessary for maintenance of homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that hyperactivity of XOD occasionally occurs in the body, and that by-products of both UA and ROS play important roles in various pathophysiological conditions [2] . Peralta et al. [22] demonstrated that XOD activity induced by hepatic ischemia-reperfusion was associated with liver and lung damage. Among human diseases, gout or hyperuricemia was also associated with the activity of XOD, and this enzyme has become a target of drugs used for therapy [20] . Therefore, its activity plays an important role in the development of several diseases. Former studies have shown that infection with NIBV could induce elevation of serum UA in chickens [1] . However, few studies have been conducted to explain the relationships between XOD and hyperuricemia induced by NIBV in the poultry industry to date.
In the present study, chickens in challenged groups sustained the highest levels of XOD mRNA transcript in kidneys at 8, 15 and 22 dpi (p ＜ 0.01). These results were correlated with the serum activity of XOD between infected and control groups. Previous studies demonstrated that XOD activity or gene transcription could be reinforced by hypoxia and pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. Poss et al. [24] showed that hypoxia exposure alone increased XOD activity, but that mRNA transcript levels remained normal in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. These results may have occurred because the bovine XOD gene lacks a hypoxia response element for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 [24] . However, Pfeffer et al. [23] demonstrated that cytokines including TNF, IFN-, IL-6, and IL-1 could induce increases in both XOD activity and mRNA transcript levels in bovine renal epithelial cells. Asasi et al. [4] demonstrated that the serum concentration of IFN- increased significantly after IBV infection. Furthermore, Okino et al. [21] showed that the highest relative expression of IL-6, IL-1, and IFN- was correlated with the degree of IBV infection. A previous study also revealed that NIBV infection could induce renal inflammatory responses [33] . Therefore, it is likely that the increase of XOD renal transcription and its serum activity was due to NIBV infection induced by the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, further study is needed to elucidate the specific mechanism responsible for the increase of XOD renal transcription and its serum activity induced by NBIV infection.
Uric acid is as an end product of endogenous or dietary purines generated by XOD in chickens. In the present study, a significant increase in the serum concentration of UA was observed in the infected group relative to the control group at 15 dpi (p ＜ 0.01). These findings were positively correlated with the increase of serum XOD activity at 15 dpi. Ejaz et al. [10] revealed that long-standing hyperuricemia could result in UA crystal deposition in intrarenal tissues and tubulointerstitial injury. A previous study showed that NIBV triggers UA salt precipitation by invading the tubule cell to initiate kidney tissue damage, and that the accumulation of UA salt could block the ureter [33] . Therefore, the increase in UA generation induced by the hyperactivity of XOD and damage of the kidney caused by NIBV might be the major reason for chicken hyperuricemia.
In addition to the generation of UA, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also generated by XOD. Chambers et al. [7] reported that XOD was a major source of ROS in reperfused myocardium. In disease promotion and prevention, ROS act as a double-edged sword. On one hand, ROS prevent initiation of disease and play a key role in the immune system and apoptosis to eliminate damaged cells [29] . Vorbach et al. [32] reported that ROS could also function as a microbicide by generating an entire cascade of microbicidal reactions and products. Conversely, the aberrant production of ROS could randomly attack lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, causing cell and tissue damage [19] . Former studies have 19reported that overproduction of free radicals could induce excessive degeneration of the polyunsaturated lipids, leading to elevated MDA levels [3, 17] . Previous studies have also shown that MDA was a significant indicator to check lipid peroxidation and cellular oxidative damage [15] , and its concentration was positively correlated with the degree of free radical-induced damage. In the present study, serum MDA values were statistically higher in the infected group than the control group at 8 and 15 dpi (p ＜ 0.01). These results indicated that the chicken suffered oxidative damage induced by the aberrant production of ROS in the infected group.
SOD and GSH-PX are free radical scavengers that play a key role in maintenance of the balance between antioxidants and oxidation. SOD is a major defense enzyme for free radical metabolism that clears superoxide anion (O 2 − ), thus preventing cell damage caused by toxic oxygen radicals. GSH-PX eliminates intracellular H2O2 and lipid radicals. The activities of both SOD and GSH-PX reflect the capability of elimination of free radicals in the body. In our study, the activities of serum GSH-PX and SOD decreased significantly in the infected group relative to the control group at 8 and 15 dpi (p ＜ 0.01), while no significant difference but a steadily decreasing trend was observed at 22 dpi. The SOD and GSH-PX levels indicated that chicken's infected with NIBV would induce an increase in ROS, leading to decreased antioxidants in the body. Nath et al. [18] reported that the kidney was vulnerable to attack by ROS. Therefore, the aberrant generation of ROS might be an another pathogenesis of kidney damage in chickens caused by NIBV infection.
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that NIBV infection could elevate XOD gene transcription and its serum activity. The elevation of XOD activity could concomitantly lead to increased UA and ROS contents. On one hand, the increase of serum UA could lead to hyperuricemia, which is the main risk factor for UA crystal deposition. On the other hand, the increase of ROS could not only induce decreased antioxidants, but also cause tissue oxidative damage.",Elevated level of renal xanthine oxidase mRNA transcription after nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus infection in growing layers,"Lin, Huayuan; Huang, Qiqi; Guo, Xiaoquan; Liu, Ping; Liu, Weilian; Zou, Yuelong; Zhu, Shuliang; Deng, Guangfu; Kuang, Jun; Zhang, Caiying; Cao, Huabin; Hu, Guoliang",J Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4701734/,199,2392,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,d0c1b37380fd7838db1f135fd702c8fd0cd67361,"Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first reported in November 2002 in China, and spreads to about 30 countries over the next few months. While the characteristics of epidemic transmission are individually assessed, there are also important implicit associations between them.
Methods A novel methodological framework was developed to overcome barriers among separate epidemic statistics and identify distinctive SARS features. Individual statistics were pair-wise linked in terms of their common features, and an integrative epidemic network was formulated.
The study of associations between important SARS characteristics considerably enhanced the mainstream epidemic analysis and improved the understanding of the relationships between the observed epidemic determinants. The response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors was simulated, target areas were detected, critical time and relevant factors were determined.
Conclusion It was shown that by properly accounting for links between different SARS statistics, a data-based analysis can efficiently reveal systematic associations between epidemic determinants. The analysis can predict the temporal trend of the epidemic given its spatial pattern, to estimate spatial exposure given temporal evolution, and to infer the driving forces of SARS transmission given the spatial exposure distribution.","Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus known as SARSassociated coronavirus, SARS-CoV. 1, 2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak; of these, 774 people died. SARS quickly obtained the status of the first pandemic of the twenty-first century. 3, 4 In this work we focus on the SARS epidemic in the city of Beijing (China) during the year 2003. SARS usually spreads by person-to-person transmission. The virus transmits most readily by respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his/her mouth, nose or eyes. In addition, it is possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known. 5 Naturally, composite space-time variations, disease parameters and determinants ( proximity to infected persons, population density, number of doctors, etc.) are essential features of the SARS epidemic. 6 Understanding these features is critical for the scientific representation of the epidemic and the efficient control of its transmission.
In general, the evolution of an epidemic is represented in terms of some kind of a mechanistic model. 7 -14 However, in the case of SARS (as well as in many other epidemic situations) only datasets of various kinds are available, whereas little is known about the underlying disease mechanisms. Mainstream statistics, time series, meta-analysis, randomized control trials and spatial techniques have been used to detect disease characteristics in a given dataset, 15 -18 but the substantive relationships between the disease characteristics across space-time often remain unknown. Similarly, the procedure generating epidemiologic curves 19 (i.e. curves showing the day-to-day rate of SARS growth) does not account for important associations between epidemic characteristics and dominant space-time disease patterns and dependencies. Despite the aforementioned limitations of the mainstream approaches, it is highly desirable to develop methods that can incorporate the scattered and incomplete datasets generated by various surveillance systems 20 -22 and by different programmatic and sectoral actions 23 in order to evaluate salient associations between epidemic determinants and quantify consequential space-time variations and patterns.
In view of similar considerations, the aim of the present work is to develop a mathematically rigorous and scientifically meaningful SARS modelling framework that accounts for the crucial epidemic associations mentioned above by combining information about space, time, disease parameters and epidemic determinants from diverse datasets. The notation used in this paper is described in Appendix 1; the reader should peruse it before proceeding.
SARS is a typical case of a communicable disease about which a set of observed data has been obtained across space and time, and its potential determinants are available in a geographical information system (GIS) format. Below, several tools are considered for exploring epidemic determinants, spatial patterns and temporal processes on the basis of the available datasets. Certain statistics pairs share common elements that can be used to link these determinants, patterns and processes, and to formulate informative associations between them.
In this study, it is assumed that the pair-wise linking of the various SARS determinants is mathematically represented by a system of the general form f(R, C, F, Q, s, t) ¼ 0, which is constructed mainly on the basis of the available datasets. The underlying epidemic mechanisms (usually represented in terms of differential equations) are not considered in this formulation, but they will be the topic of forthcoming publications.
The first SARS case in Beijing was recorded on 1 March 2003. The city consists of 16 districts and 2 counties, with a total population of 12.5 million people occupying an area of 17 800 km 2 . Information about SARS cases was available daily from authorized reports, beginning on 20 April 2003 and continuing till the end of the epidemic on 24 June 2003. Since April 27, the data in each of the 18 Beijing districts were obtained in GIS format. GIS data also provided the residential locations of all 11 108 people who had been in close contact with infected persons. This information was collected by exhaustively tracing SARS cases from 20 April 2003 onwards and backwards. Other data that were considered relevant to the epidemic were also obtained, including population counts in 246 census units, hospital locations, number of doctors in each hospital and the topography of the main traffic lines.
By way of a summary, the following datasets were systematically used in the present SARS study:
(i) New SARS cases, R(s, t), reported daily in all 18 districts; s refers to the geographical district and t to the day considered. individual close contacts to the infected persons.
A SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model was developed to represent SARS epidemic transmission in a dynamic context. The model basically involves the following successive stages of the individuals involved: 26 ), temporal process and total size can be easily simulated using a time-dependent SEIR model and a small amount of data.
In general, the determination of spatial dependence contributes significantly to adequate risk exposure assessment. 27 -31 In the present study, the nearest-neighbour hierarchical clustering (NHC) model (Appendix 3) was used to identify spatial patterns of SARS distribution. Points were randomly distributed in space and circled in a spatial cluster, if their inter-distance was significantly smaller than the mean distance. Note that the primary spatial clusters may be further clustered using the same algorithm.
Temporal changes in spatial clustering of cases
We measured the degree of global spatial data clustering using Moran's I M coefficient (Appendix 4). A positive value of the coefficient meant that adjacent districts had similar values, whereas a negative value indicated that adjacent districts were dissimilar. A temporal measure of spatial clustering was obtained by calculating this coefficient on a daily basis. This time series was then filtered using a discrete wavelet transform implemented by the MatLab computer library (http://www.mathworks.com/). In this way, the time series was decomposed into low-frequency components (reflecting the fundamental trend of a time series) and highfrequency components (reflecting noise caused by random factors).
The Black-White (BW) join-count test (Appendix 5) was used to measure the extent to which districts of a disease network shared the same infection pattern. We started with an initial disease dispersal network, which consisted of connections (or joints) between districts. Each day a district was coded black (B) if a SARS case was reported on that day; otherwise it was coded white (W). Every network joint connected two B districts (BB), two W districts (WW), or a B and a W district (BW). The observed number of BW joints was compared with the expected number, and a standard normal deviation (z-score) was used to test the significance.
High negative values of the statistics indicated clustering of infected cases on the network, whereas high positive values provided evidence of spacing. Seven networks were considered as follows:
N1. Local transmission: Two districts were considered connected if they shared a common geographical boundary. N2. Nearest district: Each district was connected to its nearest neighbour as measured by the distance between the centroids of the districts.
N3. Population size: Districts were ranked according to population size, and consecutive districts in the corresponding hierarchy were appropriately connected. N4. Population density: The same as in N3, but ranked by population density, instead. N5. Number of doctors: The same as in N3, but ranked by number of doctors in the district. N6. Number of hospitals: The same as for N3, but ranked by number of hospitals in the district. N7. Urban-rural: Eight districts were designated urban and the rest rural; a rural-urban pair was considered connected if (i) the districts shared a boundary, or (ii) the urban district could be reached from the rural district by passing through just one other rural district, or (iii) the rural district could be reached from the urban district by passing through just one other urban district.
For each network, the BW join-count statistics was calculated for each day, and statistics changes were plotted over time.
Combining space, time, parameters and factors of epidemic transmission
The above separate SARS statistics were combined by means of pair-wise linking of common items to form a network connecting (Table 1) : † -The time series of infectives R(t) and epidemic parameters Q(t); time t is here the common item. † -The spatial pattern of risk exposure C(s) and the city traffic loop T(s); space s is the common item. † -The time process of spatial clusters C(t) and the transmission determinants F(t), including spatial proximity T(t); a link is established by the consistency between the spatial patterns of C and T.
Careful considerations of the combinations described in Table 1 play a central role in the evaluation of determinant associations in a space-time context. 
Note: 'C $ T' denotes that C and T are associated (connected).
The statistics described above were applied to the datasets, in which case a systematic connection between the separate statistics was established and described below.
The time process of SARS transmission, R(t), and the transmission rate in Q(t) were simulated using the SEIR model. The risk of spatial exposure to the epidemic, C(s), was disclosed by mapping data on the residences of the 11 108 identified contacts of the Beijing SARS cases using the NHC model. 32 The first-order clusters indicated spatial clustering of high-risk susceptibles, whereas second-order clusters indicated regions with a high concentration of primary clusters. The C(s) exhibited a strong visual association with traffic infrastructure, T(s) (Fig. 1 ).
Temporal changes in the spatial clustering of cases, C(t), were determined by the time-variation of Moran's I M coefficient. The I M -curve was then filtered using a discrete wavelet transform implemented by MatLab (with Daubechies db3 as mother wave and four decomposition levels). In this way, the curve was decomposed into a low-frequency component (a 4 ) and high-frequency components (d 1 , d 2 , d 3 , d 4 ) (Fig. 2) . Daily data on new SARS cases were grouped according to the district of residence. The time-variation of a 4 indicated that SARS cases in Beijing became increasingly clustered Seven suspect determinants of the space-time SARS transmission, jointly denoted by F(t), were investigated by means of the BW join-count test. 33 The spatial proximity factor is denoted by T(t). Accordingly, Fig. 3 displays the determinants associated with SARS transmission dynamics.
The findings obtained on the basis of the different statistics of R(t), C(t), C(s) and F(t) above were pair-wise combined by means of their common elements and the corresponding network was formed as shown in Fig. 4 . Logical inferences concerning the SARS epidemic evolution based on the connected network of Fig. 4 are discussed.
In the following inference analysis, the symbol ' A&B' means A and B; ' A $ B' denotes that the entities A and B are connected; the ' A $ m $ B' means that A is linked to B via m; and the ' A!B' denotes that B is inferred from A.
Inference concerning the evolution of spatial SARS clusters was based on the rule Figure 1 illustrates that the larger spatial clusters C(s) were controlled by the urban traffic loops T(s), i.e. a proxy of the macro spatial proximity, T(t), the influence of which to the epidemic is detectable and changes with time ( Fig. 3b and c). The smaller spatial clusters in Fig. 1 are randomly distributed over space, which is consistent with the spatial distributions of the population P and the number of doctors D, the two factors playing a significant role in the epidemic decline period (Fig. 3d -f ). We concluded that the larger spatial clusters were dominant during the peak epidemic period and the smaller ones became more active during the decline period.
A similar conclusion was drawn by means of the inference rule 
In other words, Fig. 1 clearly shows that there are spatial clusters at two C(s) scales, whereas Fig. 2 depicts the time series of the spatial clustering of the two scales. The large cluster (lower frequency part, left curve in Fig. 2 ) grew until 30 April 2003, and diffused into smaller clusters thereafter (as shown in the right part of Fig. 2) , when there was a slight increase in the building up of higher-frequency components (or, equivalently, of smaller spatial clusters). Both the larger and the smaller clusters lost their strength after 8 May 2003 (Fig. 2) .
Driving forces of the temporal process Inference concerning the driving forces of the temporal process was based on the rule
The rapid decline of the daily new cases R(t) and the infective rate in Q(t) after 30 April 2003 (Fig. 3a) were predominantly driven by the spatial proximity T(t) (Fig. 3b and  c) ; and intermittently accompanied by the interaction between (infected) doctors D and the urban population density P (Fig. 3e and f ) . This trend was interrupted (see the diamond line in Fig. 3a ) by a significant transmission between rural and urban areas on 15-18 May 2003 (Fig. 3h) . 
In other words, the larger spatial clusters C(t) (associated with the a 4 component in Fig. 2 ) had a consistent trend and were controlled by spatial proximity T(t) (Fig. 3b and c) , whereas the smaller clusters C(t) (d 4 component in Fig. 2) were still building up, driven by significant P ( population density) and D (number of doctors) during the specified time period (Fig. 3e and f ) .
Inference concerning spatial clustering and intervention was based on the rule 
That is, the larger spatial clusters represented by the a 4 component of C(t) in Fig. 2 dominated the trend throughout the entire epidemic period, whereas the smaller clusters reflected in the d 4 component of C(t) became more active during the decline period. The spatial and temporal patterns of transmission were controlled dynamically by intervention measures, as reflected in the epidemic parameters Q(t) (Fig. 3a) . 32 E.g. the '(C, R, Q)(t)' denotes that the triple within the bracket change with time.
In addition to the above direct pair-wise relationship between the variables of the SARS epidemic system, some composite inferences can be also drawn. (2) and (3). Accordingly, the peak and decline times of the epidemic spread were the two best times to efficiently conduct travel-related control at the ring roads T and the doctor (D)-and population (P)-related measures in the community, given a limited budget for epidemic control.
Main finding of this study
The present work proposed a methodological framework to determine the main features of SARS transmission during the Beijing epidemic of 2003 using various datasets and space-time statistics techniques. Epidemic determinants and the relevant statistics are pair-wise linked in a space-time context, which means that the study of determinant associations can considerably enhance the mainstream epidemic analysis and improve the understanding of previously undetected relationships within the epidemic system. Several interesting findings were obtained. Spatial neighbourhood is a major component of epidemic spread modelling, whereas coupling spatial transmission with population density and healthcare workers was sporadically significant. Changes in the spatial spread of SARS over time indicated which intervention measures are likely to be most effective at different phases of the outbreak. When the epidemic is growing via diffused infection, efficient intervention measures include isolating cases and reducing inter-regional movement. When cases of the disease appear in clusters, resources should be directed towards curbing transmission within localities that have a high incidence of infection. Our results suggested that improving control measures at the local level would have been the most efficient approach, before the end of April, 2003. Local intervention strategies include quarantine of family members. Once these measures take effect, transmission is reduced substantially and becomes dominated by more remote contacts. The evidence that diffusion of infections drove the declining stage of the outbreak may indicate that the measures were successfully controlling local transmission.
Temporal variables (e.g. number of infectives, season and weather), spatial variables (e.g. risk exposure, surveillance network, travel warnings and isolation) and other factors (e.g. immunity, population, doctors, hospitals and transportation) are mapped on the SARS epidemic system. This allows transferring operations from a less detectable or operable domain to a domain with features that improve determinant identification, generate accurate predictions and sound inferences, and contribute to strategies aiming at controlling disease spread. E.g. the free travel or isolation over regions (space) lead to an increase or decrease of the total number of infectives (time); and the seasonal temperature change (time) alters the spatial pattern of risk exposure (space).
More than one statistics have to be calculated in epidemic data analysis, so more resources are needed to improve the accuracy of such calculations. Fortunately, there is a plethora of computer software and open source codes that are easily accessible on the Internet and greatly facilitate data analysis computations. In this study, the datasets are managed by the GIS software ARCGIS (http://www. esri.com/software/arcgis/). The hierarchical clustering is implemented by the Crimestat software (http://www.icpsr. umich.edu/CRIMESTAT/). Moran's coefficient I M is calculated using the GeoDA software (http://www.geoda.uiuc. edu/). Wavelet decomposition and SSEIR are computed using Matlab (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/CRIMESTAT/), and the BW test is performed using software compiled by the authors. Primary training on GIS and spatial statistics are needed in order to operate the above software.
Several epidemiologic assessments of the SARS-CoV have concluded that this coronavirus is sufficiently transmissible to cause a very large epidemic, but not so contagious as to be uncontrollable with good, basic public health measures. 3, 5 It is a common modelling practice to use a single or several separate data statistics to investigate individual epidemic properties and determinants, 6 and to quantify policies addressing problems caused by the disease. 34 Among other things, the spatial pattern, time process and driving forces of an epidemic can be explored by hierarchical clustering, SSEIR, and BW, respectively. Also, epidemiologic curves have been generated that display the day-to-day rate of SARS growth 19 but without accounting for the 'spatial pattern-time process-driving forces' associations of the epidemic. Only a limited number of studies have attempted to partially represent and evaluate determinant associations and links between separate statistics under conditions of uncertainty.
The present work is the first systematic effort to represent the aforementioned associations and links in a rigorous manner and to assess their considerable role in understanding the various aspects of epidemic distribution across space-time. Advanced mathematical modelling of an epidemic could potentially unveil the relationships between various determinants, but this modelling is often impossible due to the unavailability of the necessary scientific knowledge, including a lack of understanding of the fundamental disease mechanisms. 35, 36 Nevertheless, the present study shows that using the available datasets an informative modelling approach can be developed that is based on the pairwise linking of epidemic determinants and the formulation of a network that systematically connects the relevant statistics. In addition, unlike earlier SARS modelling studies, 5 the present approach accounts in an efficient manner for the spatial variation of the data available. This approach is particularly useful when the disease mechanisms are not clear and the corresponding mathematical model is difficult to develop for reasons mentioned above. Moreover, the approach can be successfully implemented to simulate the response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors, identify target areas and determine the critical time and relevant factors. Given the response by individuals, institutions and governments to a new and dangerous disease, the findings of the present study can be useful in the implementation of efficient epidemic intervention strategies and effective population protection policies.
The present modelling approach is concerned mainly with statistical associations rather than causal laws. The latter are available primarily in cases in which the fundamental disease mechanisms (molecular biology, etc.) are well understood. In this sense, SARS modelling could benefit from future developments in basic scientific research in disease etiology and mathematical theories of epidemic propagation, as well as from sophisticated surveillance capabilities and metaanalysis. Furthermore, the present SARS modelling could be improved by considering epidemic variation and dependence in a composite space-time continuum under conditions of multi-sourced uncertainty. This may involve a combination of random field theories with temporal GIS techniques.
By means of the novel methodological framework considered in the present work, future epidemic studies may not only benefit from 'meta data analysis' but also from 'meta model analysis'. A wide variety of inter-disciplinary datasets that are relevant to the epidemic spread can be integrated by means of this framework. The statistics functions and spatial analysis techniques described above can be readily applied to the study of epidemics other than SARS. Furthermore, the methodological framework is not limited to the statistical tools and datasets considered in this paper, but is more general and flexible, in the sense that it may include additional information sources, statistics functions and models; and it can allow the performance of other types of logical inferences, thus generating new findings and conclusions concerning the epidemic under investigation. By generalizing the current approach within the context of random field theories with temporal GIS techniques, one may consider additional issues related to the next generation of (stochastic) SARS models allowing for space-time variations, multi-sourced uncertainty, seasonality and varying transmission modes, the case of SARS virus long-time persistence, and examining the case of global eradication rather than local control in terms of early epidemic detection measures.
sequentially, beginning with the point having the largest number of neighbours. The second-order clusters were obtained by calculating the centre of each first-order cluster, and then repeating the above procedure on these centre points. The first-order clusters included at least eight points and the second-order clusters included at least four points. 
We started with the proposed disease dispersal network, which consisted of connections (or 'joins') between districts. Each day a district was coded black (B) if it reported a SARS case on that day; otherwise it was coded white (W). Every joint in the network linked two B districts (BB), two W districts (WW) or a B and a W district (BW). The observed number of BW joins was compared with the expected number, and a standard normal deviation (zscores) was used to test the significance. 39, 40 High negative values of the statistics indicated evidence of clustering of cases on the network and high positive values indicated evidence of spacing. The statistics are as follows: 
N BW number of BW joins,
wi. average of wij over the second subscript, N total number of districts, NB, NW numbers of BB and WW joins, respectively.","Data-driven exploration of ‘spatial pattern-time process-driving forces’ associations of SARS epidemic in Beijing, China","Wang, Jin-Feng; Christakos, George; Han, Wei-Guo; Meng, Bin",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518065/,188,3763,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,885674f9e88e504ac2fed625ec9c64fdc3ad71f0,"ß-Galactoside a2,6-sialyltransferase (ST) is a type II integral membrane protein of the Golgi apparatus involved in the sialylation of N-linked glycans . A series of experiments has shown that the 17-residue transmembrane domain of ST is sufficient to confer localization to the Golgi apparatus when transferred to the corresponding region of a cell surface type II in-","transferase I (NTI), ß-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GT), and c12,6-sialyltransferase (ST)have beenlocalizedto themedial-, trams-cisternae, and the trams-cistemae/TGN, respectively (Dunphy et al ., 1985; Roth and Berger, 1982; Roth et al., 1985; Chege and Pfeffer, 1990 ) . Despite our current knowledge about the morphology, organization, function, and composition of the Golgi apparatus, the mechanism for establishing and maintaining the highly ordered Golgi structure is poorly understood, and very little is known about the signals that mediate the Golgi localization of its resident proteins.
Previous studies have shown that a catalytically active fragment of ST is secreted Jamieson, 1988, 1989; Paulson and Colley, 1989) . Further experiments also showed that a 41--43 kD fragment of ST could be released from Golgi membranes by endogenous cathepsin D-like protease (Lammers and Jamieson, 1988; Weinstein et al ., 1987) . This 41-4341) fragment is not anchored in the membrane but is still enzymatically active . Protein sequencing analysis has established that this fragment is released by cleavage between residues 62 and 63 (Weinstein et al ., 1987) . It seems that the secreted form of ST is also the result of cleavage around this site . When fused to a cleavable signal sequence, an enzymatically active ST fragment from residue 58 to the COOH terminus is secreted in transfected cells . These observations suggest that the NH2-terminal region of ST is necessary for membrane anchorage and Golgi localization Paulson and Colley, 1989) .
In this report, we have fused different regions of the NH2-terminal ST sequence to the ectodomain of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), a type 11 surface membrane protein (Hong and Doyle, 1990; Ogato et al ., 1989) to study their abilities in conferring Golgi localization ofthe chimeric proteins. We found that the 17-residue transmembrane domain of ST is sufficient for Golgi localization and that this se-Native and Chimeric cDNA DPPIV. A 3 .2-kbp EcoRI cDNA fragment encoding for DPPIV in the pGEM-4Z vector (its 5' end facing the Sp6 promoter) has been described (Hong and Doyle, 1988) . Tb facilitate the construction of chimeric cDNA, the recombinant plasmid was digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI and BamHI, blunt ended, and then self-ligated . This resulted in the deletion of most of the 3'-untranslated region of DPPIV cDNA . The resulting construct was referred to as pGEM/D4S) . This process resulted in the creation of a unique EcoRl site at the 5' end and unique Xhol, XbaI, Sall, and HindIII sites at the 3' end of the DPPIV coding region . There is a unique Nod site in the codons for residues 33-35 in the DPPIV cDNA . The 5' unique EcoRl site and this Nod site were used to replace the DNA sequence encoding for the N112-terminal 32-residue sequence of DPPIV with various DNA sequences encoding for different N112-terminal ST sequences .
ST A cDNA clone of unknown identity was obtained by screening a rat kidney kgtll cDNA library with polyclonal antibodies against rat Golgi WGAbinding proteins . Limited sequence analysis established that it encodes for ST. To facilitate the analysis, oligonucleotides 1 and 2 were used to retrieve the ST coding region by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . The PCR product was digested with Xhol and inserted into the Xhol site of pGEM-11Z(+) with its 5' end facing the Sp6 promoter.
S64D. Oligonucleotides 1 and 3 were used to retrieve ST cDNA encoding for the N112-terminal 64-residue sequence by PCR . The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and Nod and used to replace the 5' EcoRI-NotI sequence of DPPIV in pGEM/D4S. The resulting chimeric cDNA thus encodes for the fusion protein S64D .
S51D. Oligonucleotides 1 and 4 were used to create chimeric cDNA for fusion protein S51D as described above for S64D.
The Journal .of Cell Biology, Volume 117, 1992 S46D. Chimeric cDNA coding for S46D was similarly constructed by using oligonucleotides 1 and 5 .
S40D. This was constructed as above using oligonucleotides 1 and 6. S33D. Oligonucleotides 1 and 7 were used to construct chimeric cDNA for S33D the same way as described above for S64D.
S27D. This was created as above using oligonucleotides 1 and 8. S26D. Oligonucleotides 1 and 9 were used to construct the chimeric cDNA for S26D. S9D. Oligonucleotides 10 and 11 were used to modify DPPIV cDNA by PCR (DPPIV cDNA as template) . The PCR product was digested with XhoI and inserted into the Xhol site of pGEM-11Z(+) . This process resulted in the substitution of DPPIV cytoplasmic domain by that of ST. S10-33D. Oligonucleotides 7 and 9 were used by PCR (ST cDNA as template) to create a cDNA fragment that encodes a protein fragment in which the NH2-terminal 6-residue cytoplasmic domain of DPPIV was fused to an ST sequence from residue 10 to 33 . The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoRl and Nod and used to replace the 5' EcoRI-NotI region of DPPIV cDNA . S10-26D. Oligonucleotides 9 and 12 were used by PCR (ST cDNA as template) to create a cDNA fragment . After digesting with EcoRl and Nod, this PCR fragment was used to replace the EcoRI-Notl region of DPPIV cDNA . This created the chimeric cDNA encoding for S10-26D.
S27-33D. Oligonucleotides 13 and 14 were used by PCR (DPPIV cDNA as template) to create a DNA fragment . The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and Nod and used to replace the EcoRI-Notl region in pGEM/D4S . The resulting chimeric cDNA encodes for S27-33D.
Chimeric cDNAs (mainly the ST and fusion regions) were all confirmed by DNA sequencing in pGEM vectors . The resulting chimeric cDNAs all have a unique XhoI site in both 5' and 3' ends . For insertion into pRSN, they were digested with Xhol to retrieve the chimeric cDNA and ligated into the Xhol site of pRSN. The right orientation was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and direct DNA sequencing of the 5' region (200-300-bp sequence) with oligonucleotide No. 15, which hybridizes to the sequence before the Xhol site of the pRSN vector. Insertion of DPPIV cDNA into pRSN has been described previously (Low et al ., 1991a,b) .
Cell Culture MDCK (strain 11) cells were a generous gift from Dr. K . Simons (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) . MDCK and the transfected cells were cultured as before (Low et al ., 1991b) .
This was performed as described previously (Low et al ., 1991b) .
Cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS containing 1 mM CaC12 and 1 MM M9C12 (PBSCM), and then fixed with 2 .7% paraformaldehyde in PBSCM at 4°C for 60 min. The fixed cells were washed once with PBSCM, twice with PBSCM containing 50 mM NH2Cl, and then three times with PBSCM (5-10 min each) . The cells were either not permeabilized for surface staining or permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBSCM for 15 min for total staining (surface plus intracellular) . mAbs (ascitic fluid), diluted 1 :1,000 in fluorescence dilution buffer (PBSCM with 5 % normal goat serum, 5 % FBS, and 2 % BSA, pH 7.6) were added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 60-120 min . After washing six times with PBSCM (5-10 min each), the cells were then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FIX (10 pg/ml) for 60-120 min . After washing, the cells were mounted in 90% glycerol in PBS, pH 8.0, containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine, observed using the Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc ., Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence optics and photographed with Kodak Tri-X 400 film . Diluted mAbs and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FIX were spun down at 4°C for 10 min (14 krpm in a microfuge) before use .
For colocalization with WGA, cells were first incubated with 0 .5 mg/ml WGA for 60 min on ice to block surface WGA binding sites . After a brief rinse with PBSCM, the cells were fixed and permeabilized as above . Cells were then incubated with rhodamine-WGA (2 .5 mg/ml) in PBSCM for 60 min . After washing, the cells were fixed again to immobilize the bound rhodamine--WGA . After WGA staining, the cells were sequentially incubated with monoclonal antibodies against DPPIV and goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC. The coverslips were then processed and observed as above .
Cells were washed twice with PBSCM and then incubated for 45 nun at 37°C inmethionine-freemedium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (labeling buffer). The cells were then pulse-labeled with [35 S]methionine (1 mCi/ml in labeling buffer), washed, and chased in medium containing excess cold methionine (100 mg/liter) for various times as detailed in each figure. For assessing the surface expression, cells were grown on Transwell filters so that the entire surface was maximally exposed for biotinylation. Cells grown on Transwell filters were similarly labeled with ( 35 S]methionine.
This was performed as described (Le Bivic et al., 1990a,b; Low et al., 1991a,b) . Briefly, cells grown on Transwell filters were washed four times with PBSCM (5-10 min each) on ice. The entire surface was biotinylated by adding to both the upperand lower chambers 1 ail of PBSCM containing s-NHS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml diluted from 200 mg/ml stock in DMSO) . The biotinylation was performed twice on ice (15-20 min each) and stopped by repeated washing with PBSCM containing 50 mM NH4Cl and medium with 10% FBS.
These were performed exactly as described previously (Low et al., 1991a,b) .
The immunocomplex on Sepharose beads was resuspended in 300 Al of 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 0-mercaptoethanol, 100 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM CaC12. 10 mU of endo H was then added. After overnight incubation at 37°C, the beads were recovered and lysed in 80 Al SDS sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE.
Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in 80 Al SDS sample buffer (without ß-mercaptoethanol) followed by dilution in several milliliters of lectin buffer (40 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaC12, 1 mM MgC12, and 1 MM MnC12). An aliquot of this was incubated withthe various lectin-agaroses (120 Al slurry) for 60-120 min. After extensive washing, the bound materials were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
In Vitro Translation and Sodium Bicarbonate Treatment These were performed as described previously (Hong and Doyle, 1990 ).
These were carried out exactly as described before (Low et al., 1991a) .
Localization ofS33D and S64D to the GolgiApparatus ST is a 47-48-kD integral membrane protein oftype II orientation (single transmembrane domain with its NH2 terminus in the cytosol and the COOH terminus in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus) Weinstein et al., 1987; our unpublished observations) . The NH2-terminal 65-residue sequence of rat ST is shown in Fig. 1 .
To determine the minimum sequence ofthe N112-terminal region of ST that is sufficient for membrane anchorage and Golgi localization, we have constructed a series of chimeric cDNAs which encode different fusion proteins ( Fig. 1 B) , with decreasing lengths of the N112-terminal ST sequence fused to the ectodomain of DPPIV . The NH2-terminal 35residue sequence of DPPIV is also shown in Fig . 1 A (D4) . Previous studies have shown that the N112-terminal 34residue sequence of DPPIV is the signal/anchor sequence (Hong and Doyle, 1990 ) . The first set of experiments resulted in the construction of chimeric cDNAs encoding for fusion proteins S64D, S5 1D, S46D, S40D, S33D, and S27D in which the same ectodomain of DPPIV (from residue 33 to the COOH-terminus) was fused to the N112-terminal 64-, 51-, 46-, 40-, 33-, and 27-residue sequence of ST ( Fig. 1 B) . In vitro translation studies demonstrated that all ofthem, except for S27D, were efficiently anchored in the membrane. The results for S27D and S33D are shown in Fig. 2 . Results similar to S33D were obtained for S64D, S51D, S46D, and S40D (data not shown) . These results demonstrated that the NH2-terminal 33-but not 27-residue sequence of ST is sufficient for membrane anchorage. Since S27D was not anchored in the membrane, it was not pursued further.
To examine the role in Golgi localization of the ST sequence in the remaining five fusion proteins, the respective chimeric cDNAs were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pRSN (Low et al., 1991a,b) and transfected into MDCK cells . Stably transfected cells were found to express the desired fusion proteins. Since similar results were obtained for all the five fusion proteins, only the results obtained for fusion proteins S64D and S33D are shown.
Pulse-chase experiments were performed to follow the intracellular transport of S64D and S33D (Fig. 3 A) . As shown, a 100-kD protein was specifically detected in the pulse-labeled cells expressing S33D. As chase proceeded, this 1004D form was converted into a 110-kD form. This conversion was very efficient, as all newly made 100-kD molecules were converted into the 110-kD form within 90 min of chase . In cells expressing S64D, a 105-kD form was initially detected in pulse-labeled cells and this form was converted into a 115-kD form during the chase period. A majority of the 105-kD form was converted into the 115-kD form after 90 min of chase, although a small amount of the 105-kD form was still observed . Endo H treatment ofimmunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 3 B) showed that the 100-kD form ofS33D and the 105-kD formofS64Dwere mainly converted into 80-and 85-kD polypeptides, respectively, which were of the same size as the respective polypeptides without any glycosylation (produced by in vitro translation without microsomes) . This result suggests that all the N-linked glycans (about 7-8 N-linked glycans, but no detectable 0-linked glycans, were present in the ectodomain of DPPIV [Hong and Doyle, 1988 ; Hong et al., 1989] ) attached to the 100-kD form of S33D and the 105-kD form of S64D were essentially sensitive to endo H and that they represent the newly made proteins in the ER bearing N-linked glycans of the highmannose type. The size of the 110-kD form of S33D was reduced by 4-5-kD after endo H treatment, suggesting that about two of the N-linked glycans in the polypeptide were of the high-mannose type while the remaining N-linked glycans (N5-6) were resistant to endo H. For the MAD form Residue numbers from the NH2 terminus are indicated above the sequence. (B) Summary of fusion proteins used in this study and their properties in membrane anchorage and cellular localization . Residue numbers corresponding to ST are indicated above while those to D4 are indicated below each fusion protein. For fusion proteins, they were named SxD (in which the NH2-terminal X-residue sequence of ST was fused to the ectodomain of DPPIV) or Sx-yD (in which the ST sequence from residue x to y was used to replace the corresponding region of DPPIV) . For membrane anchorage, + and -indicates that the majority of the protein is membrane anchored or not, respectively, as assessed by in vitro translation experiments. For cellular localization, Sand Grepresent surface or Golgi localization, respectively, as examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, while nd indicates ""not determined"" because of theirnonanchorage in the membrane.
Figure 2. Membrane anchorage of selected fusion proteins . The mRNA for the fusion protein was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with microsomes as described previously Doyle, 1988, 1990) . 10 pl of total translation reaction was diluted with 100,u1 of sodium bicarbonate, pH 11 .0, and the membrane-associated proteins (P) were separated from those extractable by this treatment (S) . Samples equivalent to 4 gl of original translation were analyzed forboth P and S fractions. The 80-kD polypeptide is the untranslocated form, while the 100-kD polypeptide is the translocated N-glycosylated form for the respective fusion proteins . of S64D, a 2-3 kD size decrease was observed after endo H treatment, suggesting that one of the N-linked glycans was a high-mannose type while the rest (-6-7) of the N-linked glycans were endo H resistant . These results demonstrate that the majority of the N-linked glycans in the 110ÁD form of S33D and the MAD form of S64D had been modified by enzymes in the medial-Golgi cisternae . These results therefore show that both fusion proteins were transported efficiently from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and that they were localized in the medial-and/or post-medial-Golgi compartment.
Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine the cellular localization of these fusion proteins Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to DPPN and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The smaller-and the larger-sized bands represent the ER and Golgi forms, respectively. (B) Endo H treatment of fusion proteins S33D and S64D. Cells expressing the respective fusion proteins were labeled with PIS]methionine for 30 min followed by 30 min of chase . After being immunoprecipitated, half of the sample was treated with endo H (+ ) while the remaining half was processed in an identical way except that no endo H was included (-) .
( Fig . 4 A) . An intense staining signal was detected on the surface of MDCK cells expressing normal DPPN (A) . A similar staining pattern was observed for normal DPPIV in permeabilized cells (B) except that some perinuclear signal was also detected . The perinuclear staining most likely represents molecules in transit through the Golgi apparatus . In contrast, only background staining was observed on the surface of cells expressing S33D (C) and S64D (E) . When the cells were permeabilized, intense perinuclear vesiculartubular staining was detected in the cells expressing S33D (D) and S64D (F) . This pattern of intracellular staining is typical for the Golgi apparatus (Lipsky and Pagano, 1985 ; Louvard et al., 1982; Saraste et al., 1987) , suggesting that S33D and S64D are predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus .
To further confirm the Golgi localization of S33D and S64D, colocalization of S33D or S64D with intracellular WGA binding sites was carried out . Intracellular WGA binding sites are present predominantly in the Golgi apparatus (Lipsky and Pagano, 1985 ; Tartakoff and Vassalli, 1983) . As shown in Fig . 4 B, the staining for S33D (A) and S64D (C) colocalized well with that for WGA binding sites (B and D). These results demonstrated that S33D and S64D were indeed localized to the Golgi apparatus .
Localization ofS33D and S64D to the Trans-Golgi Cisternae and/or TGN The results obtained from pulse-chase and endo H treatment experiments suggest that S33D and S64D were present in the medial-and/or post-medial-Golgi cisternae . The indirect fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that they were localized in the Golgi apparatus . To further determine the compartment of their localization, their N-linked carbohydrate structures were examined by lectin affinity chromatography (Haselbeck et al ., 1990; Lis and Sharon, 1986) (Fig. 5) . Cells expressing S33D were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine followed by 30 min of chase such that both the 100-kD ER form and the 110-kD Golgi form of S33D were present in the cells . Similar amounts of labeled S33D were incubated with various lectin-agarose beads . The material bound to the beads was analyzed . As shown in Fig. 5 A, both the 100-and 11041) forms could be quantitatively recovered with Con A-agarose (mannose-binding lectin) (lane 2), consistent with the presence of N-linked glycans of high-mannose type in both 100-and 110-kD forms of S33D as concluded from the endo H experiment . The 110-but not the 100-kD form was also recovered from WGA-, Erythrina cristagalli, (ECA)-, Sambucus nigra (SNA)-, and Maackia amurensis (MAA)-agarose beads. Since ECA binds specifically to the Gal-01,4-G1cNac structure in N-linked glycans, this result demonstrates that the 110-kD form has been modified by trans-Golgi GT. SNA and MAA bind a-2,6-and a-2,3linked sialic acids, respectively. Thus the 110-kD form of S33D has been modified byboth a-2,6-and a-2,3-sialyltransferases, both of which are localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN . These results demonstrate that S33D had been modified by glycosyltransferases of the trans-Golgi cisternae and the TGN and suggest that it is localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN . WGA binds both sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine while succinylated WGA (sWGA) binds only N-acetylglucosamine (Monsigny et al., 1979 (Monsigny et al., , 1980 . The binding of 110-kD S33D to WGA but not sWGA not only confirmed the presence of sialic acid on the N-linked glycans but also demonstrated that no N-acetylglucosamine residues were exposed on the glycans . Both the 100-and the 110-kD forms of S33D failed to bind Lotusagarose, a fucose-specific lectin . This result suggests that no significant fucose residues were added to the N-linked glycans of S33D. Similar experiments performed with cells expressing S64D (Fig . 5 B) revealed that the 115-kD Golgi form of S64D binds Con A-, WGA-, ECA-, SNA , and MAA-, but not sWGA-or Lotus-agarose (identical pattern as the 110-kD form of S33D). The 115-kD form of S64D has thus been modified by both GT and sialyltransferases . The 105-kD form of S64D was quantitatively recovered from Con (10041)) and Golgi (11041)) forms were present . Similar amounts of the immunocomplex were analyzed directly (Control) or incubated with various lectin-agaroses and the bound fraction was then analyzed . (B) Lectin-binding properties of S64D.

A-agarose beads . Interestingly, a small but detectable portion of the 105-kD form of S64D was also capable of binding WGA, ECA, and SNA (but not sWGA, Lotus, or MAA) . This observation suggests that a small fraction of the 105-kD form might have undergone modifications by 0-GT and ST, although the possibility that the observed binding of the 105-kD form of S64D to WGA, ECA, and SNA was due to nonspecific background binding could not be excluded yet . The small amount of 105-kD form present in pulse-labeled cells after 90 min of chase (Fig . 3 A, lane 5) may therefore have been transported to the Golgi apparatus . These results, taken together, suggest strongly that both S33D and S64D are localized in the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN .
We have thus demonstrated that both S33D and S64D are predominantly present in the Golgi apparatus . Similar results were obtained for S51D, S46D, and S40D (data not shown) . These results demonstrate that the NHz-terminal 33-residue sequence of ST is sufficient for Golgi localization and that the stem region of ST (sequence from residue 34 to 63) is apparently not essential for Golgi localization . The sequence in this stem region is in fact the most divergent be-25 1 tween rat and human ST. The NH2-terminal 64-residue sequence ofhuman ST (Grundmann et al ., 1990) is also shown in Fig . 1 A (M) . Incontrast to the stem region, the sequence of the cytoplasmic domain is totally conserved between the rat and human ST. The transmembrane domain is also highly conserved . The sequence conservation of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains but not the stem region is consistent with our finding that the NH2-terminal 33-residue sequence of ST is sufficient for Golgi localization . This 33residue sequence can be further divided into three regions : the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain, and the 7-residue sequence flanking the COOH-terminal side of the transmembrane domain. To further narrow down the sequence required for Golgi localization, an additional five chimeric cDNAs were constructed which encode fusion proteins S26D, S9D, S10-33D, S10-26D, and S27-33D (Fig. 1  B) . In vitro translation studies demonstrated that S26D, like S27D, was not anchored in the microsomal membrane (Fig.  2) . Interestingly, S10-26D, which is identical to S26D except that the ST cytoplasmic domain was replaced by that of DPPIV, was mainly (N70%) anchored in the membrane (Fig. 2) . For S26D, S27D, and S10-26D, the translocated form in the supernatant was ofa smaller size than the translocated form in the membrane, implying that the nonanchorage in the membrane of S26D, S27D, and, to a much lesser extent, SIO-26D might be due to a cleavage of (or part of) the signal/anchor sequence ofST by the signal peptidase, although this explanation will have to be verified by future experiments . Replacing the cytoplasmic domain of ST by that of DPPIV in S10-26D significantly enhanced the membrane anchorage . In connection with the results obtained with S27D and S33D (Fig. 2) , it can be concluded that the signal/anchor sequence of ST is within its NH2-terminal 33-residue sequence, comprising the 17-residue hydrophobic core and flanking hydrophilic sequences on both sides. The nature of the hydrophilic sequences on either side of the hydrophobic core significantly affect its efficiency in acting as a signal/anchor sequence. Results similar to S33D (Fig. 3) were obtained for S9D, S10-33D, and S27-33D (data not shown) . Based on these in vitro translation results, chimeric cDNAs encoding S9D, S10-33D, S10-26D, and S27-33D (S26D was not pursued further) were inserted into the pRSN expression vector and transfected into MDCK cells. The cellular localization ofthe fusion proteins was examined by indirect fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig . 6 , intense surface staining was detected for S9D (A) and S27-33D (C), but not for S10-33D (E) or SIO-26D (G) . When the cells were permeabilized, intense intracellular staining ofperinuclear vesicular-tubular network was observed for SIO-33D (F) and S10-26D (H), typical of the Golgi apparatus . This was further confirmed by their colocalization with intracellular WGA binding sites (data not shown) . S10-26D and S10-33D have lectin-binding properties similar to those of S33D and S64D, demonstrating the modification of their N-linked glycans by GT and sialyltransferases (data not shown) . S10-26D and S10-33D thus reside in the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN .
To obtain quantitative data on the intracellular Golgi localization of the various fusion proteins, we used a biochemical approach to determine the levels of surface expression of respective proteins (Fig. 7) (Bretscher and Lutter, 1988; Le Bivic et al ., 1990a,b ; Low et al., 199la,b) . For convenience, we arbitrarily defined the surface expression of DPPIV as 100% . The extent of surface expression for other proteins was normalized with that ofDPPIV and defined as a percentage of surface expression . As shown, the surface expression of S33D, S64D, S10-33D, and S10-26D was between 2 and 6 % as compared with DPPIV. The loss of surface expression demonstrates that the Golgi localization signal of ST is highly effective in targeting the fusion proteins to the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, high levels of surface expression, comparable to DPPIV, were observed for S9D and S27-33D. These biochemical results are consistent with and further extend the indirect immunofluorescence data.
Newly made molecules of S33D, S64D, S10-33D, and S10-26D were hardly detectable on the cell surface after 3 h of chase (Fig. 7) . In connection with the predominant Golgi staining of these proteins, these results suggest that they are specifically and efficiently retained in the Golgi apparatus . However, the possibility that they may be initially transported to the cell surface and then rapidly and effectively endocytosed and sorted to the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN could not be ruled out because only a single chase point was examined. If endocytosis followed by sorting is the mechanism for their Golgi localization, a peak in surface expression should be expected during a series of chase intervals after a single pulse-labeling . Cells expressing S33D, S10-26D, and DPPIV were selected for further examination . Cells were pulse-labeled with ['SS]methionine for 30 min. After chasing for 15 min, 45 min, 90 min, 2 h, 6 h, and 22 h, cells were surface biotinylated with NHSbiotin and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated . One tenth of the immunoprecipitate served as a measure of the total amount of labeled fusion protein (1/10 Total), while nine tenths was absorbed with streptavidin-agarose to recover the biotinylated surface proteins (Surface) (Fig. 8) . All were initially made as the 100-kD form followed by rapid conversion into the 110-kD form, demonstrating that they were efficiently transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus . Strong surface expression was detected for DPPIV, and an almost maximal level of surface expression was detected after 90 min of chase. Since S33D and S10-26D were transported to the Golgi apparatus as efficiently as DPPIV, a peak expression on the surface at -90 min of chase should be ex- ]methionine for 30 min followed by 3 h of chase. Proteins exposed on the cell surface were biotinylated with NHS-biotin . Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies against DPPIV. One tenth of the immunocomplex was analyzed directly and served as a measure ofthetotal amount of the respective protein (1/107). The remainingnine tenths was absorbed to streptavidin-agarose to recover the biotinylated proteins and analyzed (Surf) . This served as a measure of the amount that was expressed on the cell surface. (B) Quantitation of the results in A. The cell surface expression of each fusion protein was normalized to that of DPPIV (arbitrarily defined as 100%). Transfected cells A, B, C, D, E, F, and G represent cells expressing DPPIV, S91), S27-331, S33D, S64D, S10-331), and S10-261), respectively.
pected if their Golgi localization was mediated by initial surface expression followed by specific retrieval and endocytosis. This was not observed for either S33D or S10-261. The surface expression for S33D and S10-261 was undetectable after 90 min of chase and only Nl-2%0 (normalized to DPPIV surface expression) was visible after 2 h of chase. Longer chase up to 6 h revealed a slight increase (up to 4-6%) in surface expression for S33D and S10-2611 This was most likely due to the slight leakiness in their Golgi retention. Interestingly, surface expression was undetectable after 22 h of chase, which couldbe explained by surface deg-The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 117, 1992 radation and/or slow internalization with the bulk membrane endocytosis. These results suggest that both S33D and S10-26D are specifically retained intracellularly in the Golgi apparatus.
The I7-Residue Transmembrane Domain of ST Is Sufcientfor Golgi Localization Previous observations have shown that the N112-terminal re-gion of ST is required for membrane anchorage and Golgi localization Jamieson, 1988, 1989; Paulson and Colley, 1989 ; Colley et al ., 1989; Weinstein et al ., 1987) . We thus constructed a series of chimeric cDNAs encoding fusion proteins in which the N112 -terminal ST sequence of different sizes were fused to the ectodomain of a cell surface protein DPPIV (Hong and Doyle, 1990; Ogato et al ., 1989; Low et al., 1991a,ó) . When expressed in transfected MDCK cells, fusion proteins bearing NHZ-terminal 64-, 51-, 46-, 40-, and 33-residue ST sequences were all localized to the Golgi apparatus as assessed by indirect fluorescence microscopy and other biochemical methods. The results with two fusion proteins, S33D and S64D, are presented in this report . Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that both S33D and S64D wereefficiently transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and have passed beyond the medial-Golgi cisternae . Affinity chromatography with several lectin-agaroses demonstrated that both S33D and S64D were extensively modified by GT and ST. Since GT has been previously localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae (Roth and Berger, 1982) and ST has been localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae and TGN (Both et al ., 1985) , these results suggest that S33D and S64D are localized in the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or the TGN . Because the actual localization of ST in MDCK cells has not been established, our conclusion for the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN localization of S33D and D64D is based on the assumption that ST is localized in the same compartments in MDCK cells .
Our results, nevertheless, demonstrated that S33D and S64D are localized in the Golgi subcompartments in which they have extensive interaction with endogenous GT and ST. Since S33D and S64D (as well as S51D, S46D, and S40D) were localized to the Golgi apparatus with comparable efficiencies, it was concluded that the N112-terminal 33-Wong et al .

Cells expressing DPPIV, S33D, or S10-26D were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min followed by a series of chase intervals as indicated . The cell surface proteins were biotinylated at each chase point . Cell lysates prepared from each chase interval were immunoprecipitated . One tenth of the immunocomplex was analyzed as a measure of total newly made protein (1/10 Total) .

The N112-terminal 33-residue sequence was further divided into three regions : the 9-residue cytoplasmic domain, the 17-residue transmembrane domain, and the 7-residue sequence flanking the COOH-terminal side of the transmembrane domain . More chimeric cDNAs were thus constructed encoding additional fusion proteins. The transmembrane domain alone (in S10-26D) or in combination with its 000Hterminal flanking sequence (in S10-33D) could confer Golgi localization, while the cytoplasmic domain alone (in S9D) or the COOH-terminal flanking sequence alone (in S27-33D) was not capable of conferring Golgi localization . These results thus demonstrate that the 17-residue transmembrane domain of ST is sufficient for Golgi localization . Further characterization of the fusion protein S10-26D by lectin affinity chromatography demonstrated thatthe 17-residue sequence can confer the same Golgi subcompartment localization as the NHZ-terminal 33-and 64-residue sequence of ST.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recently, a common peptide stretch was described for Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases (Bendiak, 1990) . This stretch (Ser-Gln-Glu-Lys) is located between residues 46 and 51 (residue 47-50) in ST. Our results clearly demonstrate that this stretch is not critical for Golgi localization. Furthermore, the sequence of this stretch is not conserved in the human ST (Ser-Leu-Gly-Lys) (Grundmann et al ., 1990) . Since glycosyltransferases are localized to distinct subcompartments of the Golgi apparatus, it is hard to envision a common sequence for distinct subcompartment localization . Further studies with other glycosyltransferases will reveal the structural features required for localization to other subcompartments of the Golgi apparatus .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since our study involved extensive """"Cut-and-Paste ex-periments for the fusion of domains derived from two different proteins", one may argue that conformational changes might have contributed to the results observed in our system . This seems highly unlikely because the chimeric proteins were transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus as efficiently as normal DPPIV and were modified by enzymes in all subcompartments of the Golgi apparatus. If there was any conformational abnormality, the fusion proteins would have been retained in the ER and/or pre-Golgi compartments. Many misfolded chimeric proteins have been described and all failed to be transported beyond the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus (Rose and Doms, 1988) . Furthermore, preliminary experiments have shown that all the fusion proteins possessed similar enzymatic activity as the normal DPPIV, suggesting no global conformational change in the ectodomain of DPPIV in the chimeric proteins . Additional experiments demonstrated that the Golgi localization of the chimeric proteins by the ST transmembrane domain is a specific event, because the replacementof the transmembrane domain of DPPIV by that of another type II surface protein resulted in a chimeric protein that was transported to the cell surface (data not shown) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Golgi localization of the fusion proteins could be mediated by their specific retention in the Golgi subcompartment (in this case, the Golgi localization signal functions as a retention signal). Alternatively, they could be initially transported to the cell surface followed by their efficient retrieval and transcytosis back to the final Golgi localization . To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used the membrane-impermeable reagent NHS-biotin to selectively tag the proteins present on the cell surface after a single pulse and several chase intervals. The biotinylated proteins were specifically recovered by absorption to streptavidin-agarose and served as a measure of surface expression . Efficient surface expression of DPPIV was detected . Studies with S33D and S10-26D demonstrated that they were hardly detectable on the cell surface. These results established that the majority of S33D and S10-26D were specifically retained in the Golgi apparatus and that the 17-residue transmembrane domain of ST functions as a retention signal for the Golgi subcompartment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our studies demonstrated that the membrane-spanning region of ST, in addition to its passive role in membrane anchorage, plays a dominant role in Golgi retention. Our observations raised the question of whether the transmembrane domains of other glycosyltransferases play similar roles in specifying their subcompartment Golgi localization . Comparison of the primary sequences of GT revealed that the entire transmembrane domain is identical in human and bovine and that 19 of the 20 residues in the transmembrane domain are also conserved in mouse (DAgostaro et al ., 1989 ; Masri et al ., 1988 ; Russo et al ., 1990 ; Shaper et al., 1988) . Furthermore, the sequence of the transmembrane domain of NTI is totally conserved between human and rabbit (Kumar et al ., 1990 ; Sarkar et al ., 1991) . The high degree of conser-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 117, 1992 vation in the transmembrane domain sequence of GT and NTI suggests that they might also be involved in other functions in addition to their role in membrane anchorage. Whether the transmembrane domain of GT and/or NTI is similarly involved in Golgi localization needs further investigation . Our recent studies with NTI suggest that its transmembrane domain is indeed involved in Golgi localization (Tang et al ., 1992) . The sequence of the trans-membrane domain varies greatly between ST, GT, and NTI, and this sequence divergence of the transmembrane domain among different glycosyltransferases might be related to their distinct subcompartment localization in the Golgi apparatus. Further studies will shed more light on this issue. The Golgi localization specified by the transmembrane domain of ST could potentially be mediated by two different but related mechanisms . The membrane spanning domain may interact with specific lipid components (or specific lipid microenvironment) in the Golgi membrane . This interaction may immobilize the proteins in a particular microdomain in the membrane. Proteins in this microdomain may be specifically prevented from entry into the budding vesicles for subsequent transport. Alternatively, the transmembrane domain may interact with a specific membrane-spanning region of other proteins that are already immobilized in the Golgi membrane through unknown mechanisms. Furthermore, interaction of the transmembrane domains among different molecules of ST (self interaction) induced by the Golgi environment may also be involved . At present, we are unable to propose a detailed molecular mechanism to explain the Golgi localization mediated by the ST transmembrane domain . Future studies with point mutations in the ST transmembrane domain and other glycosyltransferases will enable us to gain more understanding about the cellular targeting mediated by the transmembrane domain .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cellular localization determined by a membrane anchoring region has been described for other proteins. Recent studies have established that the GPI lipid anchor functions as a targeting signal for the apical plasma membrane domain in epithelial cells Lisanti et al., 1989) . Furthermore, the transmembrane domain of the T cell antigen receptor a-subunit has been sown to be sufficient for ER degradation and subunit assembly of the T cell antigen receptor (Bonifacino et al ., 1990) . Studies with the El protein of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus, a cis-Golgi protein (Machamer et al ., 1990) , demonstrated that the first of its three transmembrane domains is necessary and sufficient for Golgi localization (Machamer and Rose, 1987 ; Swift and Machamer, 1991) , although different results were obtained with the El protein of another coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus A59) (Armstrong et al ., 1990 ; Armstrong and Patel, 1991) . These observations suggest that the subcellular destination of some integral membrane proteins is signaled by their membrane-spanning regions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During the review of this manuscript, two papers were published which demonstrated that the membrane-spanning domain of GT (Nilsson et al ., 1991) and the transmembrane domain and its flanking sequences of ST (Munro, 1991) could specify Golgi localization . Although similar conclusions were reached by Munro in his study, there were a few significant differences in the approach and results presented from our study. (a) Munro used a transient expression system in COS cells while our study was performed in stably transfected MDCK cells. (b) Our results clearly demonstrate that the 17-residue transmembrane domain itself was sufficient for Golgi localization of the chimeric protein and its flanking sequences did not contribute much to the efficiency of Golgi localization . This difference could be due to the different expression systems used and the fact that our chimeric proteins were derived from two well-defined cellular proteins of the same membrane topology while those in Munro's study involved a tripartite fusion among three proteins. (c) In addition to confirming biochemically the Golgi localization of the chimeric proteins, we also used surface biotinylation to demonstrate that the Golgi-localizedchimeric proteins were not initially transported to the cell surface followed by recycling back to the Golgi," providing the first evidence that they were selectively retained in the Golgi complex.""","The 17-residue transmembrane domain of beta-galactoside alpha 2,6- sialyltransferase is sufficient for Golgi retention",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289426/,57,6856,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,f39b51bbd9ece044b1af4f83b6ff05053810e7d9,"The M glycoprotein from the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), contains information for localization to the cis -Golgi network in its first transmembrane domain. We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids. Because the site of sphingolipid synthesis overlaps the localization of IBV M, we asked whether perturbation of sphingolipids affected localization of IBV M. Short-term treatment with two inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis had no effect on localization of IBV M or other Golgi markers. Thus, ongoing synthesis of these lipids was not required for proper localization. Surprisingly, a third inhibitor, d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-","1-propanol (PDMP), shifted the steady-state distribution of IBV M from the Golgi complex to the ER. This effect was rapid and reversible and was also observed for ERGIC-53 but not for Golgi stack proteins. At the concentration of PDMP used, conversion of ceramide into both glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin was inhibited. Pretreatment with upstream inhibitors partially reversed the effects of PDMP, suggesting that ceramide accumulation mediates the PDMP-induced alterations. Indeed, an increase in cellular ceramide was measured in PDMP-treated cells. We propose that IBV M is at least in part localized by retrieval mechanisms. Further, ceramide accumulation reveals this cycle by upsetting the balance of anterograde and retrograde traffic and/ or disrupting retention by altering bilayer dynamics.
T he organelles of the classical secretory pathway must maintain their identity despite a large flux of lipids and proteins. Two models have emerged to explain how proteins can be maintained in specific compartments (Machamer, 1993; Nilsson and Warren, 1994 ). The retention model proposes that proteins are efficiently anchored in the appropriate compartment. The retrieval model proposes that proteins are continually recycled from later compartments. The two models are not mutually exclusive; indeed most proteins within the secretory pathway probably use both mechanisms for localization, albeit to differing extents. An example of this is the localization of the ER resident protein BiP, which contains a KDEL retrieval signal but is only slowly secreted when this signal is removed (Munro and Pelham, 1987) . This suggests that other parts of the molecule may contain retention information.
The M glycoprotein from the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), 1 is a model protein for studying localization to the early secretory pathway. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that IBV M expressed in the absence of other IBV proteins was found in the tubulovesicular structures at the entry or cis face of the Golgi stack, as well as the first or second cisterna of the Golgi stack (Machamer et al., 1990; Sodeik et al., 1993) . We will refer to this region as the cis -Golgi network (CGN; Mellman and Simons, 1992) . Defined in this way, we would consider the CGN to at least partially overlap with the intermediate compartment (IC), defined by such markers as ERGIC-53 or p58 (Schweizer et al., 1988; Lahtinen et al., 1996) . The first transmembrane domain of IBV M is sufficient to target chimeric proteins to the CGN (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Machamer et al., 1993) . Although the transmembrane domains of other Golgi proteins also contain targeting information, no consensus motif for localization has been identified (for review see Colley, 1997) . We are intrigued by the possibility that the targeting of Golgi membrane proteins may in part depend on interactions between their transmembrane domains and specific membrane lipids.
Independent studies demonstrate that the lipid compositions of membranes differ at each stage of the secretory pathway (Keenan and Morre, 1970; Cluett et al., 1997;  for review see van Meer, 1993) . Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin (SM) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the precursor to all gangliosides, are one class of lipids thought to increase in relative concentration through the secretory pathway. Ceramide, the precursor of sphingolipids, is synthesized in the ER. In rat liver, ceramide is converted into the different classes of sphingolipids by enzymes localized to the CGN and the cis -and medial -Golgi cisternae (Futerman et al., 1990; Futerman and Pagano, 1991) . When expressed from a recombinant vaccinia virus, IBV M is localized to the CGN in several cell types, and its localization presumably overlaps with that of SM and GlcCer synthase activities. This led us to speculate that there may be a link between sphingolipid synthesis and the localization of IBV M. To address this question we tested the effects of three sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors on the steady-state localization of IBV M. We observed a dramatic redistribution of IBV M induced by one of these inhibitors, the glucosylceramide analogue d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP). Use of upstream inhibitors coupled with lipid analysis suggested that the PDMP effects are mediated by the accumulation of the precursor ceramide. Because IBV M can be induced to move to the ER, we propose that IBV M is at least in part localized by retrieval mechanisms.
FCS was from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA); fumonisin B1 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); chromatography plates were from E.

Antibodies were obtained as follows: monoclonal anti-Bip, Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada); monoclonal anti-giantin and monoclonal anti-ERGIC-53, Hans-Peter Hauri (Basel, Switzerland); polyclonal anti-␤ -COP, Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); polyclonal ␣ -mannosidase II, Marilyn Farquhar (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and Kelley Moreman (University of Georgia, Athens, GA); polyclonal antibodies to IBV M and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were prepared as described (Machamer and Rose, 1987; Weisz et al., 1993, respectively) ; Texas red-and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA).
Cell Culture. Tissue culture cells were grown in DME supplemented with 5% (BHK-21) or 10% (Vero) FCS. Cells were grown at 37 Њ C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 .
Pulse-Chase Labeling. Pulse-chase experiments were performed as previously described (Rosenwald et al., 1992; Weisz et al., 1993) . Briefly, cells were plated in 35-mm dishes the night before the experiment to be 90% confluent the next day. VSV (San Juan strain, Indiana serotype) was adsorbed for 30 min in 0.5 ml of serum-free DME. At 4 h after infection, the cells were starved for methionine for 15 min. Cells were then pulsed for 5 min with 50 Ci 35 S-Pro-mix and chased for the indicated amount of time in the presence or absence of the indicated drugs. The isopropanol carrier alone had no effect on the rate of transport of VSV G protein. After the chase, cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in detergent. VSV G protein was then immunoprecipitated, treated with endo H as described (Rosenwald et al., 1992) , separated by SDS-PAGE, and visu-alized by fluorography. Endo H-sensitive and -resistant forms of the VSV G protein were quantitated by densitometry.
Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy. These experiments were performed as previously described (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . Briefly, cells were infected for 30 min with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV M, and the indicated treatments were begun 4 h after infection. For experiments using exogenous ceramides, the soluble short-chain analogues of ceramide were added to cells as a complex with 0.34 mg/ml defatted BSA as described (Pagano and Martin, 1988) . After treatment, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the appropriate antibody. Images were acquired using a microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence and a CCD camera (Photometrics Sensys, Tucson, AZ) using IP Lab software (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). All images shown are the raw data collected at 1 ϫ 1 binning with a gain of 1.
Lipid Synthesis Assays. Cells were seeded onto 6-cm plastic dishes 2 d before the experiment so that they were 90% confluent the day of the experiment. Cells were incubated in DME supplemented with 50 g/ml cycloheximide, and half of the dishes were also incubated with 5 mM ␤ CA. 1 h later, fresh medium containing cycloheximide and [ 3 H]palmitate (100 Ci/ dish) was added, along with either 1% isopropanol (control and ␤ CA) or 100 M PDMP and 5 mM ␤ CA if indicated. 1 h later, cells were trypsinized and washed off the plate in 0.8 ml cold PBS. To normalize lipid levels, 50 l were removed for a protein assay by the method of Bradford (1976) . Lipids were then extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959) . Labeled samples were doped with 10 g cold ceramide to allow for visualization. Samples were run on 10 ϫ 10 cm high performance thinlayer chromatography plates with a mobile phase of chloroform/glacial acetic acid (9:1; Abe et al., 1992) . Plates were sprayed with water to visualize the ceramide bands that were scraped and counted after the addition of scintillation fluid. Alternatively, plates were dipped in 10% 4,5-diphenyloxazole in chloroform for visualization by fluorography (Henderson and Tocher, 1992) .
To test whether ongoing sphingolipid synthesis was necessary for the correct localization of the IBV M protein, we used three inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis: ␤ -chloroalanine ( ␤ CA; Medlock and Merrill, 1988) , fumonisin B1 (FB1; Wang et al., 1991) , and PDMP (Vunnam and Radin, 1980; Inokuchi and Radin, 1987) . The biosynthetic pathway for sphingolipids with the sites of inhibition of these drugs is shown in Fig. 1 . Both ␤ CA (5 mM) and FB1 (100 M) inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into sphingolipids in BHK-21 cells by Ͼ 90% (data not shown). Consistent with previous results (Rosenwald et al., 1992) , we found that PDMP (100 M) inhibited GlcCer synthesis by ‫ف‬ 90% and SM synthesis by ‫ف‬ 50% in BHK-21 cells (data not shown).
To express the IBV M protein, BHK-21 cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV M (Machamer and Rose, 1987) . 4 h after infection the cells were treated with cycloheximide for 1 h to chase newly synthesized M protein out of the ER. Sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors were then added and the cells incubated for another 1 h before processing for immunofluorescence ( Fig. 2) . In control cells, IBV M exhibited a tight, juxtanuclear staining pattern that colocalized with Golgi markers. The Golgi localization pattern of IBV M was unchanged by treatment with either ␤ CA or FB1, suggesting that ongoing sphingolipid synthesis is not required for proper localization of IBV M. In contrast, PDMP-treated cells showed a marked change in the staining pattern of the IBV M pro-tein after 1 h. The localization of IBV M in the presence of PDMP changed from Golgi to ER based on the absence of strong juxtanuclear staining and the presence of nuclear rim staining and a tubulo-reticular staining pattern that colocalized with ER markers. Treatment of infected cells with lower concentrations of PDMP had no effect on IBV M localization and very little effect on SM synthesis (data not shown). We next tested the kinetics of PDMP-induced mislocalization of IBV M. Cells were infected as before and treated for 1 h with cycloheximide. Then cells were treated with PDMP for varying lengths of time up to 1 h (Fig. 3) . Redistribution was first observed at 15 min and became maximal at 60 min. This redistribution was rapidly reversible, such that 30 min after washing out PDMP, IBV M had moved back to the Golgi region.
We next asked if PDMP mislocalized other Golgi markers. Cells were infected and treated as described above and then stained with antibodies to two integral membrane proteins of the Golgi stack, giantin (Linstedt and Hauri, 1993) and mannosidase II (Man II; Moremen and Robbins, 1991; Velasco et al., 1993) . Treatment of cells with 100 M PDMP for 1 h had no effect on the localization of either protein (Fig. 4) , suggesting that the morphology of the Golgi was not greatly altered. We also examined the localization of ␤ -COP, a peripheral membrane protein of the stack and CGN involved in vesicular traffic (Oprins et al., 1993) . As seen in Fig. 4 , the distribution of ␤ -COP appeared unaffected in treated cells.
We then looked at a protein which cycles through the cis -Golgi. As we did not have access to antibodies that crossreact with known markers in BHK-21 cells, we examined ERGIC-53 in Vero cells. IBV M localizes to the CGN in these cells and is also redistributed to the ER by PDMP (data not shown). ERGIC-53 is an IC protein that cycles between the ER, IC, and Golgi stack (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993) . Vero cells were treated with 50 g/ml cycloheximide for 1 h. PDMP (100 M) was added, and dishes were fixed at the indicated times and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence. After 1 h in PDMP, the remaining dishes were washed three times with 1 ml DME with serum and incubated with cycloheximide-containing medium for the indicated time before being prepared for indirect immunofluorescence. For each experimental series, the Nomarski image is shown on the left and the fluorescence image on the right. Bar, 10 m. with cycloheximide for 1 h and then with or without 100 M PDMP for an additional hour before being fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence (Fig. 5) . Similar to the effects on IBV M, PDMP treatment shifted the steady-state distribution of ERGIC-53 to the ER. In addition, neither ␤ CA nor FB1 had any effect on the localization of ER-GIC-53 (data not shown).
The above immunofluorescence results suggested that PDMP might generally alter the distribution of proteins that have a dynamic localization mechanism. Interestingly, it has been shown that PDMP slows the rate of both anterograde vesicular traffic (Rosenwald et al., 1992) and endocytosis (Chen et al., 1995) in CHO cells. We tested whether PDMP also slowed anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. We used a plasma membrane protein, the well-characterized G protein from VSV. A pulse-chase experiment was performed either in the presence or absence of PDMP, ␤ CA, or FB1. The rate of accumulation of endo H-resistant VSV G was used as an assay for the rate of arrival at the medial -Golgi. Neither ␤ CA nor FB1 had any effect on the rate of anterograde traffic. However, PDMP increased the halftime for transport by ‫ف‬ 2.5-fold from 18 to 44 min (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 shows that neither ␤ CA nor FB1 had any effect on the transit rate of VSV G, suggesting that the decreased rate with PDMP was not due to a block in the ongoing synthesis of sphingolipids. PDMP inhibits the conversion of ceramide into glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin. One possible explanation for the effects observed with PDMP was an accumulation of the precursor ceramide. ␤ CA and FB1 act upstream of PDMP (Fig. 1) , and the intermediates in sphingolipid synthesis between these steps and ceramide production are thought to be short lived (Merrill and Wang, 1986; Medlock and Merril, 1988) . To ask if ceramide accumulation might mediate the PDMP-induced slowing of anterograde traffic, cells were treated with ␤ CA or FB1 before PDMP. We performed a pulse-chase labeling experiment with cells pretreated with either ␤ CA or FB1 for 1 h before being chased in the presence or absence of ␤ CA or FB1 and PDMP (Fig. 6) . Pretreatment with the earlier inhibitors reduced the PDMP-induced slowing of anterograde traffic by about half, suggesting that accumulation of newly synthesized ceramide at least partially mediates this effect.
To test whether ceramide was likely to mediate the PDMPinduced mislocalization of IBV M, indirect immunofluorescence was performed as above with cells pretreated with either ␤ CA or FB1 for 1 h before the addition of PDMP. To simplify the quantification, the localization of IBV M was classified into one of three staining patterns. Class 1 was the most commonly seen pattern in untreated cells, i.e., tight juxta-nuclear staining that colocalized with Golgi markers. Class 3 was the most commonly seen pattern in PDMP-treated cells, i.e., diffuse staining with prominent nuclear envelope staining that colocalized with ER markers. Class 2 was intermediate between the class 1 and class 3. Whether this pattern represents an overlap of ER and Golgi staining patterns or an increase in IC staining is not clear. For these experiments, coded samples were quantified by counting at least 100 cells for each sample. The experiment was performed five times, with one representative experiment shown (Fig. 7) . Interestingly, when cells were quantified in this way, we observed that both ␤ CA and FB1 caused a slight shift from class 1 to class 2. The significance of this observation is not clear. PDMP dramatically shifted the distribution of IBV M from mainly class 1 in the control cells to mainly class 3. Pretreatment with either ␤ CA or FB1 significantly reduced this shift in the staining pattern of IBV M, suggesting that accumula- Figure 5 . PDMP induced the redistribution of the endogenous IC protein, ERGIC-53, to the ER. Vero cells were incubated with cycloheximide for 1 h and then incubated for 1 h in the presence either 1% isopropanol (control) or 100 M PDMP. Cells were then fixed and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies to ERGIC-53. For each experimental group, the Nomarski image is shown on the left and the fluorescence image on the right. Bar, 10 m. 
The pretreatment experiments suggested that increased levels of ceramide mediate the PDMP-induced effects on IBV M localization. Ceramide can act as a second messenger (for review see Hannun, 1994) and has been suggested to be the mediator of some of the effects of PDMP in CHO cells (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993) . Furthermore, in several systems, cellular levels of ceramide increased upon treatment with PDMP or one of its more soluble analogues (for example see Rani et al., 1995; Posse de Chaves et al., 1997) . We measured the levels of ceramide after various treatments by pulse-labeling with [ 3 H]palmitate. After labeling and treatment, cellular lipids were extracted and run on chromatography plates. The appropriate spots corresponding to ceramide were scraped and counted. Consistent with our hypothesis, Fig. 8 A shows that PDMP treatment increased the levels of ceramide 2.5-fold over control levels. Pretreatment with ␤ CA reduced PDMPinduced ceramide accumulation to roughly half of control levels, but this level was still threefold higher than cells treated with ␤ CA alone. Fig. 8 B is a representative fluorograph showing the ceramide region that was quantified in Fig. 8 A. Interestingly, we noticed the appearance of a lower migrating ceramide band in PDMP-treated cells.
The pretreatment experiments as well as lipid analysis implicated ceramide as the mediator of PDMP effects. If this were true, addition of a soluble, short-chain analogue of ceramide might mimic the effects of PDMP. Indeed, one such cell-permeable analogue of ceramide, N -hexanoylsphingosine (C 6 Cer), reproduces the effects of PDMP on anterograde traffic of VSV G in CHO cells (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993) . We first asked whether C 6 Cer slowed anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. A pulse-chase labeling experiment with VSV-infected cells was performed, with cells chased in the absence or presence of 25 M C 6 Cer. C 6 Cer slowed the rate of anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells ‫-5.2ف‬fold (data not shown). We went on to use C 6 Cer in our indirect immunofluorescence assay. As expected, C 6 Cer had no effect on the localization of either Man II or ␤-COP (Fig. 9) . However, contrary to our expectation, C 6 Cer did not alter the localization of either IBV M or ER-GIC-53. This suggests that exogenously added C 6 Cer and ceramide generated by treatment with PDMP do not have the same effects. Two other soluble analogues of ceramide, C 2 Cer and C 8 Cer, were also tested and found to have no effect on the localization of IBV M (data not shown).
There are two possible mechanisms to maintain the steady-state localization of proteins to specific sites along the secretory pathway: (a) retention in the particular compartment, and (b) retrieval from other compartments (Machamer, 1993; Nilsson and Warren, 1994) . The redistribution of IBV M induced by PDMP was surprising, as we expected that if we disrupted its localization, it would move with ""bulk flow"" to the plasma membrane. That IBV M was redistributed to the ER suggests that it has specific targeting information for retrieval to the ER. Coupled with earlier work in our laboratory on the role of oligomerization of IBV M chimeras in CGN targeting (Weisz et al., 1993) , our findings suggest that IBV M maintains its steady-state distribution by both retention and retrieval ( Fig. 10 A) . We propose two models to explain the redistribution of IBV M protein induced by PDMP. The simplest model (Fig. 10 B, left arrow) is that the M protein normally cycles between the ER and the Golgi at a significant rate, as has been shown for ERGIC-53 (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993) . The slowing of anterograde traffic would cause the protein to shift its steady-state distribution to the ER, assuming that retrograde traffic is unaffected or perhaps increased by PDMP. A second possibility is that PDMP disrupts retention of the M protein, which then cycles back to the ER by normal retrieval mechanisms (Fig. 10 B, right arrow) . These two models are not mutually exclusive, and both effects of PDMP may be necessary to redistribute IBV M to the extent observed.
Implicit in both models is the idea that IBV M contains retrieval information. PDMP-induced ER redistribution was also observed for ERGIC-53, a dilysine-containing IC marker known to cycle through the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993) . Double-label immunoelectron microscopy in HeLa cells showed that the distri-bution of ERGIC-53 and IBV M overlapped significantly, though not completely (Sodeik et al., 1993) . This suggests that IBV M may in part use the same, as yet unknown, cellular machinery used by IC proteins to maintain its steadystate localization. Using deletion mutants and chimeric molecules, dissection of IBV M retention and retrieval information should be possible using PDMP as a tool. The pathway followed by IBV M during retrieval will also be important to decipher. Experiments in nontreated cells suggest that the protein may move through later Golgi compartments even though its steady-state distribution is the CGN, because its oligosaccharides are slowly processed (Machamer et al., 1990) .
Interestingly, we did not observe redistribution of two Golgi stack markers (Man II and giantin) to the ER with PDMP treatment. Golgi membrane proteins were recently suggested to be highly mobile (Cole et al., 1996b) and to cycle through the ER (Cole et al., 1996a) . Our results with PDMP suggest that cycling of these proteins does not occur during the time scale of our experiments, and/or that its predominant effect on IBV M is a loss of retention.
Interestingly, it has been shown that myriocin, an inhibitor of sphingolipid synthesis thought to inhibit the same step as ␤CA, reduces the rate of transport of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein but not other proteins out of the ER in yeast (Horvath et al., 1994) . It would be interesting to test whether inhibition of ceramide synthesis in mammalian cells also slows the rate of transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins in mammalian cells. However, neither ␤CA nor FB1 had an effect on the rate of anterograde traffic of VSV G or the localization of IC, CGN, or Golgi stack proteins. When we quantified the effects of these two inhibitors on the immunofluorescence Figure 9 . Exogenous C 6 Cer did not redistribute IBV M or ER-GIC-53. BHK cells (IBV M, Man II, and ␤-COP) or Vero cells (ERGIC-53) were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing IBV M. 4 h after infection the cells were treated with 50 g/ml cycloheximide. At 5 h after infection cells were incubated for 1 h in serum-free DME with 0.34 mg/ml defatted BSA with or without 25 M C 6 Cer. Cells were then prepared for indirect immunofluorescence and stained with the indicated antibodies. For each experimental series, the Nomarski image is shown on the left and the fluorescence image on the right. Bar, 10 m. Figure 10 . Current models for how IBV M maintains its steady-state distribution and how PDMP might alter this distribution. (A) Evidence presented here shows that IBV M can be induced to redistribute to the ER, indicating that IBV M has information necessary for traffic to the ER. We propose that IBV M normally maintains its steady-state distribution by cycling through the ER at some basal rate. (B) If IBV M is cycling through the ER normally, then its localization would depend on the balance of anterograde and retrograde traffic rates. As PDMP slows anterograde traffic, IBV M could accumulate in the ER when the balance of membrane traffic is disrupted (left arrow). Alternatively, PDMP may act by disrupting the retention of IBV M, causing it to move out of the Golgi (right arrow). It is also possible that redistribution of IBV M requires both effects of PDMP. staining pattern of IBV M, we did detect a slight shift toward the intermediate staining pattern (Fig. 7) . Whether this represents an altered distribution pattern or subtle effects on Golgi structure caused by these inhibitors is unclear. From these results we conclude that ongoing sphingolipid synthesis is not required for either normal rates of anterograde traffic or proper localization of Golgi proteins. However, the glucosylceramide analogue PDMP, at a concentration that inhibits both GlcCer and SM synthases, causes a redistribution of IBV M to the ER and a slowing of anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. Why does PDMP have these effects while ␤CA and FB1 do not? It is likely that PDMP exerts its effects by causing the accumulation of ceramide. Other groups have found that the various effects of PDMP and its active analogues were concomitant with (Uemura et al., 1990; Shayman et al.; Rani et al., 1995) or actually caused by increases in ceramide concentrations (Abe et al., 1996; Posse de Chaves et al., 1997) . In BHK-21 cells treated with 100 M PDMP for 1 h we measured an increase in newly synthesized ceramide (Fig. 8 A) , showing at least a correlation between levels of newly synthesized ceramide and the effects of PDMP on protein traffic and localization. The fact that pretreatment with either ␤CA or FB1, both of which block the synthesis of ceramide, can ameliorate the effects of PDMP demonstrates that ceramide is at least in part the mediator of these effects. However, the effects of PDMP are not completely abolished by pretreatment, even though ␤CA pretreatment reduced the level of newly synthesized ceramide by 50% compared to control. One explanation is that ceramide accumulation is only one of the ways that PDMP exerts its effects. Another possibility is that ceramide is being generated by the degradation of preexisting sphingolipids, e.g., at the cell surface or in lysosomes. This ceramide cannot be made back into sphingolipids because the enzymes SM and GlcCer synthases are inhibited in the presence of PDMP. Interestingly, the fluorograph of the ceramide bands generated after the various treatments (Fig. 8  B) shows different relative amounts of ceramide species. We suspect that these ceramides differ in acyl chain lengths (Abe et al., 1992) and that this may be an indication of different sources of ceramide, i.e., de novo synthesis or sphingolipid degradation. We are currently investigating this possibility.
Based on the pretreatment results, we expected that soluble analogues of ceramide would mimic the effects of PDMP. Rosenwald and Pagano (1993) showed that like 100 M PDMP, 25 M C 6 Cer decreased the rate of transit of an itinerant protein to the medial-Golgi in CHO cells. Consistent with these results, 25 M C 6 Cer also slowed anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. However, 25 M C 6 Cer had no effect on the localization of either the M protein or ERGIC-53. Other short-chain ceramide analogues (C 2and C 8 -ceramide) also had no effect on IBV M localization. How does this fit with our model that ceramide mediates PDMP effects? One explanation is that the effect on protein localization is independent of the effect on antero-grade traffic rates. In this case, it may be that C 6 Cer and endogenous ceramide have similar ability to bind and affect proteins that regulate anterograde traffic, but C 6 Cer is unable to bind or affect proteins that regulate protein localization. It has been shown that some short chain analogues of ceramide do not have the same effects as endogenous ceramide (e.g., Wolff et al., 1994) . A second possibility is that effects of ceramide are limited to the bilayers in which its concentration increases, and the difference seen between endogenous ceramide and exogenous C 6 Cer is due to the different intracellular distribution of these molecules. C 6 Cer would be unlikely to accumulate in compartments where IBV M and ERGIC 53 reside, because it is rapidly converted to sphingolipids there (Rosenwald et al., 1992) . Effects on membrane traffic might be more dramatic in compartments where C 6 Cer accumulates, possibly the trans-Golgi and TGN (Pagano et al., 1989) . Consistent with this idea, the rate of movement of VSV G through the late Golgi (measured by sialylation) was slowed to a much greater extent by C 6 Cer than by PDMP (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993) .
It is not yet clear how ceramide induces the changes in anterograde traffic and protein localization. Recent studies have shown that ceramide (Hannun, 1994) and its metabolites (Hakomori, 1990 ) play a major role as second messengers. Preliminary experiments with both the ceramidase inhibitor N-oleoylethanolamine and exogenously added sphingosine suggest that the ceramide breakdown product sphingosine does not play a role in the localization of IBV M (Maceyka, M., and C. Machamer, unpublished observations). Ceramide activates a cytosolic protein phosphatase (Dobrowsky and Hannun, 1992; Wolff et al., 1994) that can be inhibited by okadaic acid. Preliminary experiments suggest that okadaic acid does not block the PDMPinduced changes (Maceyka, M., and C. Machamer, unpublished observations). Ceramide could be activating a protein kinase (Mathias et al., 1991) , but this kinase has not been fully characterized. Another possibility is that increased ceramide within the lipid bilayer directly affects the localization of IBV M. Earlier work from our laboratory showed that the first transmembrane domain of IBV M can target chimeras to the CGN (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Machamer et al., 1993) . It is possible that CGN bilayers have distinct lipid domains, and that these domains contain different sets of proteins, analogous to glycosphingolipid rafts. Segregation of membrane proteins involved in vesicular traffic, such as SNAREs, would lead to mobile and immobile domains. We hypothesize that under normal conditions, IBV M would be targeted to an immobile domain and escaped molecules would be cycled back through the ER. Elevated levels of ceramide could disrupt these immobile lipid domains, inducing IBV M to cycle. Alternatively, perhaps ceramide binds to IBV M transmembrane domains, preventing an interaction with immobile lipid domains.","Ceramide Accumulation Uncovers a Cycling Pathway for the cis-Golgi Network Marker, Infectious Bronchitis Virus M Protein","Maceyka, Michael; Machamer, Carolyn E.",J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2132625/,107,5123,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feline tumor necrosis factor (fTNF)-alpha is closely involved in the aggravation of FIP pathology. We previously described the preparation of neutralizing mouse anti-fTNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb 2-4) and clarified its role in the clinical condition of cats with FIP using in vitro systems. However, administration of mouse mAb 2-4 to cat may lead to a production of feline anti-mouse antibodies. In the present study, we prepared a mouse-feline chimeric mAb (chimeric mAb 2-4) by fusing the variable region of mouse mAb 2-4 to the constant region of feline antibody. The chimeric mAb 2-4 was confirmed to have fTNF-alpha neutralization activity. Purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were repeatedly administered to cats, and the changes in the ability to induce feline anti-mouse antibody response were investigated. In the serum of cats treated with mouse mAb 2-4, feline anti-mouse antibody production was induced, and the fTNF-alpha neutralization effect of mouse mAb 2-4 was reduced. In contrast, in cats treated with chimeric mAb 2-4, the feline anti-mouse antibody response was decreased compared to that of mouse mAb 2-4-treated cats.","Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. Several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen and central nervous system, are affected in cats that develop FIP, and the formation of lesions in these organs is accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation [13] . Pleural effusion and ascitic fluid were reported to accumulate in some cats. Macrophages/monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP. For example, differences in the proliferation of macrophages/monocytes were shown to be related to differences in pathogenicity between feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV [2, 16] . FECV and FIPV cannot be serologically or genetically distinguished from each other; however, FECV infection is normally asymptomatic in cats.
We previously reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha is involved in the aggravation of FIP [17] [18] [19] . TNF-alpha binds to cell surface TNF receptors and induces various physiological activities [15, 23] . TNF-alpha plays a critical role in many aspects of immunity. However, the excessive production of TNF-alpha can lead to acute inflammation and immune system abnormalities in human and other animals. The involvement of TNF-alpha in aggravating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease has been reported [1, 9, 24] . Moreover, previous studies have described aggravation of the pathologies of viral infections (such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and dengue virus infections) due to increased TNF-alpha production [5, 12, 14, 21, 25] . TNF-alpha was produced excessively by FIPV-infected macrophages. TNF-alpha was involved in lymphopenia and increase in the level of the cellular receptor of serotype II FIPV, aminopeptidase N (APN) [18, 19] . It is also reported that neutrophil apoptosis in cats with FIP was inhibited by TNF-alpha. This finding suggests neutrophilia in cats with FIP due to TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil survival [17] .
Anti-TNF-alpha agents are expected to improve the symptoms of FIP caused by viral infection. We previously described the preparation of a feline TNF-alpha (fTNF-alpha)neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (anti-fTNF-alpha mAb, mAb [2] [3] [4] . This mAb 2-4 exhibited high neutralizing activity against recombinant and natural TNF-alpha, and was confirmed to inhibit the following fTNF-alpha-induced conditions in vitro: i) an increase in the survival rate of neutrophils from cats with FIP, ii) APN mRNA expression in macrophages and iii) apoptosis of a feline T-lymphocyte cell line [4] . These findings strongly suggested that mAb 2-4 is applicable as a therapeutic drug against FIP. We are also investigating that mouse mAb 2-4 administration to SPF cats experimentally infected with FIPV alleviated the clinical condition of cat with FIP [3] . However, because this is a mouse-derived antibody and is a xenogeneic protein for cats, induction of feline anti-mouse antibodies may reduce the reactivity of mouse mAb 2-4 against fTNF-alpha.
In humans, infliximab is used as a therapeutic drug for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition to neutralizing human TNF-alpha, which is a factor aggravating the pathology of RA, infliximab directly injures TNF-alpha-producing cells expressing TNF-alpha on the cell surface through antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Infliximab exhibits its treatment effect against RA through these actions. Infliximab is repeatedly administered at 4-or 8-week intervals until RA remission is observed. Accordingly, to reduce antigenicity for humans, infliximab is expressed in mammalian cells as a mouse-human chimeric antibody prepared by fusing the variable region of mouse mAb and the constant region of human antibody [20] . Human anti-mouse antibody response to the mouse-human chimeric mAb was reduced compared to that of the mouse mAb response, and the adverse reactions after administration were also reduced. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that the feline anti-mouse antibody response and the development of adverse reactions after administration may be reduced by substituting the amino acid sequence of the feline antibody constant region for that of the mAb 2-4 constant region.
In the present study, we prepared mouse-feline chimeric mAb (chimeric mAb 2-4), in which the variable region of the previously reported anti-fTNF-alpha mAb 2-4 was fused to the feline antibody constant region, and confirmed its fTNF-alpha neutralization activity. In addition, purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were repeatedly administered to cats to investigate the changes in ability to induce a feline anti-mouse antibody response.
Cell cultures: FO mouse myeloma cells (ATCC CRL-1646) and WEHI-164 murine sarcoma cells (ATCC CRL1751) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The hybridoma mAb 2-4 cell was developed in our laboratory [4] . FO cells and hybridoma mAb 2-4 cell producing the antibody to feline TNF-alpha were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. WEHI-164 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotics, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 µg/ml of polybrene.
Cloning of variable regions of heavy chain and light chain of mAb 2-4 and constant regions of heavy chain and light chain of feline immunoglobulin: RNA isolation from cells and cDNA preparation were performed employing the method of [18] . The variable region genes of the mAb 2-4 (V H and V L ) were amplified by PCR from cDNA of hybridoma mAb 2-4 mRNA. The constant region gene of feline immunoglobulin heavy chain (C H ) was amplified from cDNA of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA. The constant region gene of feline immunoglobulin light chain (C L ) was artificially synthesized by Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) based on a published nucleotide sequence (Genbank AF198257.1) and inserted into the pMA-T plasmid. The primer sequences used for PCR are shown in Table 1 . V H , V L , C H and C L were individually cloned in pCR-blunt II-TOPO vectors using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Life Technologies).
Construction and expression of chimeric mAb 2-4: The C H and C L genes and V H and V L fragments inserted in the pCR-bluntII-TOPO vectors were connected using a Bam HI linker to prepare chimeric H and L chains (Fig. S1 ), respectively. The chimeric H chain fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pCDNA3.1 (+)/Neo expression vector. The chimeric L chain fragment was inserted into the HindIII/EcoRV site of the pCDNA3.1 (+)/Hygro expression vector. FO cells were co-transfected with the H-and L-chain expression vectors with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). The transfected FO cells were cultured in medium containing G418 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and hygromycyn B (Roche Diagnostics), to acquire a stably expressing cell line (FOCM24). FOCM24 cells were cloned twice employing the limiting dilution method.
Purification of mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4: Mouse mAb 2-4 was purified from the hybridoma mAb 2-4 culture supernatant with Protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) according to the product manual. Chimeric mAb 2-4 was purified from the FOCM24 culture supernatant with Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare). After purification, the buffer of mAbs was exchanged to PBS (pH 7.4) by Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices (NMWL 30,000; Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). The concentrations of purified mAbs were assayed by the Bradford method.
Western immunoblotting assay: Purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were incubated without 2-mercaptoethanol at RT for 5 min (non-reducing condition). mAbs were incubated with 2-mercaptoethanol at 100°C for 10 min (reducing condition). mAbs were run using 15% sodium 
dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and a transferred nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.88% NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 hr at 37°C. Following washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat antimouse IgG (H+L chain specific) (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL, U.S.A.) or horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-feline IgG (whole molecular) (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, U.S.A.) for 1 hr at 37°C and then visualized in the substrate for 10 min. Neutralization test of mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 against feline TNF-alpha using WEHI-164 cells: Neutralization test was performed as described previously [4] . Briefly, WEHI-164 cells were suspended at 1 × 10 6 cells/ml in the dilution medium containing 1 µg/ml of Actinomycin D (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) and pre-incubated at 37°C for 3 hr. Serially diluted mouse mAb 2-4, chimeric mAb 2-4 or anti feline APN mAb (mAb R-G-4, as a control for mAb 2-4) was mixed with 40 ng/ml recombinant fTNF-alpha (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A., 75% cytotoxic activity against WEHI-164 cells) or ascites of cats with FIP that were used as natural feline TNF-alpha samples (final concentration of 1:8, 80% cytotoxic activity against WEHI-164 cells). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Pre-incubated cells were seeded in a volume of 50 µl in the wells of a 96-well plate. Fifty microliters of the mixture was then added into each well. After incubation at 37°C for 24 hr, 10 µl of WST-8 solution (WST-8 cell proliferation assay kit; Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was added, and the cells were returned to the incubator for 1 hr. The absorbance of formazan produced was measured at 450 nm with a 96-well spectrophotometric plate reader, as described by the manufacturer. The percent neutralization was calculated by the following formula: Neutralization Repeated-dose test in cats: The mAb repeated-dose test was performed referring to the method reported by Umehashi et al. [22] . Purified mouse mAb 2-4, chimeric mAb 2-4 or PBS as a control was administered to 5 specific pathogen free (SPF) cats aged 2 months. After sedation with Medetomidine (Domitor, Orion Corporation, Espoo, Finland), the SPF cats received low-(1 mg/kg) or high-dose (5 mg/kg) mAb injection into the cervical vein 5 times at 2-or 4-week intervals. Serum was collected immediately before administration. Blood pressure and pulse were measured at the forearm or root of the tail before mAb administration and 10 min after administration, using a fully automatic electronic sphygmomanometer (Pettrust, Aster Electric Co., Yokohama, Japan). The measurements were performed in triplicate. This animal experiment was performed in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of Kitasato University (the number of approval is 14-045). SPF cats were maintained in a temperature-controlled isolated facility.
Changes in anti-mouse antibody in mouse mAb 2-4-or chimeric mAb 2-4-injected cat serum: Immulon 4HBX ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) were coated overnight at 4°C with purified mouse mAb 2-4 (500 ng/100 µl/well) diluted with carbonate buffer (0.05 M, pH 9.6). After washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.02% Tween-20, the plates were blocked with a blocking buffer containing 0.5% skim milk in PBS at 37°C for 60 min. Each well of the plates then received 100 µl of 200-fold diluted serum collected from mAb treated cats. After 60 min incubation at 37°C, the plates were washed, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-feline IgG (whole molecular) was diluted to the optimal concentrations, and then, 100 µl of the dilution was added to each well of the plates. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the plates were washed, and each well received 100 µl of substrate solution and was incubated at 25°C for 10 min in the dark. The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 0.1 M citric acid and 0.2 M Na 2 HPO 4 buffer (pH 4.8) and adding 0.2 µl/ml of 30% H 2 O 2 . The reaction was stopped with 3 N H 2 SO 4 solution, and the optical density (OD) at 492 nm was determined.
Changes in neutralization activity of mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 reacted with mouse mAb 2-4-or chimeric mAb 2-4-injected cat serum: Sera collected from the mAbtreated cats were diluted 10-fold with medium. The diluted sera were reacted for one hour with mouse mAb 2-4 or chimeric mAb 2-4 at the minimum concentration necessary for 80% or higher neutralization of 10 ng/ml recombinant fTNF-alpha. The reactant was then combined with recombinant fTNF-alpha (final concentration: 10 ng/ml). One hour later, the reactants were administered to WEHI-164 cells. The level of TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity was measured after 24 hr.
The V H (414 bp) and V L (378 bp) genes were amplified from cDNA derived from hybridoma mAb 2-4 (Fig. S2) , and the C H gene (1005 bp) was amplified from cDNA derived from feline PBMCs. The C L gene (330 bp) was amplified using a plasmid containing a known C L gene as a template. Each PCR product was cloned into the pCR-blunt II-TOPO vector and sequenced. The V H and C H genes were ligated, inserted into the pCDNA 3.1 (+)/Neo expression vector and sequenced (Fig. S3) . The amino acid sequence deduced from the base sequence was confirmed to show the characteristics of the variable region of mAb 2-4 and the constant region of the feline immunoglobulin heavy chain. Similarly, the amino acid sequences of the V L and C L genes were deduced from the base sequences, and it was confirmed that the recombinant protein had the characteristics of the variable region of mAb 2-4 and the constant region of the feline immunoglobulin kappa light chain (Fig. S4) .
Western immunoblotting assay of mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4: FO cells harboring the expression vector were cultured, and chimeric mAb 2-4 in the culture supernatant was collected. Chimeric mAb 2-4 and mouse mAb 2-4 were individually purified using a protein A or protein G column. The purified mAbs were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and their purities were confirmed by CBB staining. No protein band other than those of mAbs was detected by SDS-PAGE. The purified chimeric mAb 2-4 was western blotted with mouse mAb 2-4. When non-reduced mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were electrophoresed, smear-like bands were detected at 135-kDa and higher (Fig. 1A) . When the blot was reacted with anti-mouse IgG antibody, bands were detected in the lane applied with mouse mAb 2-4, but no band was detected in the lane applied with chimeric mAb 2-4. When the blot was reacted with anti-feline IgG antibody, bands were detected in the lane applied with chimeric mAb 2-4, but not in the lane with mouse mAb 2-4.
When reduced mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were electrophoresed, approximately 25-kDa and 50-kDa bands were visible (Fig. 1B) . When the blot was reacted with anti-mouse IgG antibody, 50-and 25-kDa bands were detected in the lane applied with mouse mAb 2-4, but no band was observed in the lane with chimeric mAb 2-4. When reacted with anti-feline IgG antibody, a band approximately 25-kDa was detected in the lane with mouse mAb 2-4, and 50-and 25-kDa bands were detected in the lane with chimeric mAb 2-4.
Neutralizing activity of mAbs against feline TNF-alpha: Mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were tested for their neutralization activity against recombinant fTNF-α using the WEHI-164 cytotoxicity assay system. Mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 neutralized the cytotoxic activity of recombinant fTNF-alpha on WEHI-164 cells in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, the neutralization activity of mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 against endogenous fTNF-alpha contained in ascites of cats with FIP was confirmed. Mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 neutralized the cytotoxic activity of ascites from cats with FIP on WEHI-164 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) . mAb R-G-4 (as a control for mAb 2-4) did not neutralize the cytotoxic activity of both recombinant fTNF-alpha and ascites of cats with FIP ( Fig. 2A and 2B) .
Repeated-dose test in cats: Purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were repeatedly administered to SPF cats at 2-or 4-week intervals, and the blood pressure and pulse were measured before and after administration ( Table 2) . Body temperature tended to decrease after administration of PBS, mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 throughout the period with 5 administrations, but no significant difference was observed among the 3 groups. Neither were there any differences in blood pressure or pulse between the groups or due to dosing frequency.
Serum was collected at various time points from cats treated with PBS, mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4. The feline anti-mouse antibodies in mAb-injected cat serum were detected using ELISA against mouse mAb 2-4 (Fig. 3) . Feline anti-mouse antibodies were detected in mAb-injected cat serum.
To investigate whether there were neutralizing antibodies against mouse and chimeric mAb 2-4 in mAb treated cat serum, the collected sera were reacted with mouse mAb 2-4 or chimeric mAb 2-4, and changes in the fTNF-alpha neutralization activities of these antibodies were measured. When mouse mAb 2-4 was reacted with sera from cats treated with 1 or 5 mg/kg mouse mAb 2-4, its neutralizing activity was decreased (Fig. 4A ), but when it was reacted with serum from PBS-treated cats, no decrease in the neutralizing activity was observed. When chimeric mAb 2-4 was reacted with serum from cats treated with 1 mg/kg chimeric mAb 2-4, no decrease in the neutralizing activity of chimeric mAb 2-4 was observed, similarly to that observed when reacted with serum of PBStreated cats (Fig. 4B) . Regarding serum from cats treated with 5 mg/kg of chimeric mAb 2-4, the neutralizing activity of chimeric mAb 2-4 decreased when it was reacted with sera collected after the 3rd administration and thereafter (28 days after the initial administration) (Fig. 4B) .
FIP is a fatal inflammatory disease caused by FIPV. Treatment of FIP-induced systemic inflammation with antiinflammatory drugs, such as steroids, has been investigated, but existing anti-inflammatory drugs only transiently improves FIP symptoms, and the survival time and quality of life remain unable to be improved [6] . We previously reported that progression to the FIP was prevented by inhibition of the physiological activity of an inflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha. When anti-fTNF-alpha mouse mAb was administered to cats with FIP, their survival time and quality of life were improved [3] . However, administration of mouse mAb to xenogeneic animals may cause adverse reactions. We prepared mouse-feline chimeric mAb (chimeric mAb 2-4) by modifying the mouse anti-fTNF-alpha mAb 2-4 and investigated its fTNF-alpha neutralization activity. In addition, changes in the feline anti-mouse antibody response-inducing ability induced by repeated administration of purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 in cats were investigated.
Chimeric mAb 2-4 was prepared by fusion of the variable region of anti-fTNF-alpha mouse mAb 2-4 and the feline antibody constant region and expressed in FO cells. Mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were purified and analyzed using western blotting. Anti-mouse IgG antibody reacted with mouse mAb 2-4 but did not react with chimeric mAb 2-4, whereas anti-feline IgG antibody did not react with mouse mAb 2-4 but reacted with chimeric mAb 2-4, confirming that the antigenicity of chimeric mAb 2-4 is similar to that of feline IgG. When neutralization of fTNF-alpha by purified chimeric mAb 2-4 was investigated, chimeric mAb 2-4 neutralized recombinant and natural fTNF-alpha, similarly to mouse mAb 2-4. Based on these findings, chimeric mAb 2-4 possesses fTNF-alpha neutralization activity similar to that of mouse mAb 2-4 while maintaining the characteristics of feline IgG.
Purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were administered to cats. Five administrations of the mAb did not cause any anaphylactic reaction in either group. Umehashi et al. reported the relationship between repeated administration of mouse mAb and mouse-feline chimeric mAb and the induction of anaphylactic reactions, in which several administrations of 10 mg/kg mouse mAb or chimeric mAb did not cause any anaphylactic reaction in cats, whereas 50 mg/kg mouse mAb did [22] . Based on this finding, the antibody dose and dosing frequency adopted in our study were within the range shown not to induce anaphylactic reaction. Because a human-mouse chimeric mAb, infliximab, is repeatedly administered to humans at doses of 3 or 5 mg/kg, and mouse mAb 2-4 exhibited a therapeutic effect at 3 mg/ kg in FIP cats, the doses used in the present study were set based on these findings [8, 10, 11] . Experiments to confirm whether or not an anaphylactic reaction is induced by highdose repeated administration are warranted.
Single administration of mouse mAb 2-4 improved the survival time and quality of life of cats with FIP [4] ; however, single administration did not exhibit a therapeutic effect in some cats. It is known that single administration of an anti-fTNF-alpha drug is unlikely to exhibit a therapeutic effect on cats with FIP; thus, several administrations of mAb 2-4 are necessary for treatment. However, several administrations of mouse mAb may induce anaphylactic reactions, as described above. Moreover, mouse mAb is a xenogeneic protein for cats, suggesting that a feline anti-mouse antibody response is induced in cats treated with mouse mAb 2-4, decreasing the reactivity against fTNF-alpha and thus reducing the therapeutic effect. The possibility of feline anti-chimeric antibody production similar to the production of anti-mouse mAb 2-4 antibody cannot be ruled out due to the variable region of chimeric mAb 2-4 being derived from mouse protein.
Thus, the induction of feline anti-mouse antibodies in cats treated with mouse and chimeric mAb was investigated. As the feline anti-mouse antibody was increased in serum, the fTNF-alpha neutralization effect of mAb 2-4 was reduced in cats treated with mouse mAb 2-4 and 5 mg/kg chimeric mAb 2-4. That is, no neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb 2-4 induction was observed in cats treated with 1 mg/ kg chimeric mAb 2-4, suggesting that feline anti-mouse antibody induction was prevented by modifying mouse mAb 2-4 to chimeric mAb 2-4. Accordingly, repeated administration of chimeric mAb 2-4 may not decrease the therapeutic effect in cats. However, in cats receiving 5 mg/kg chimeric mAb 2-4 administration, the neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb 2-4 was induced after the 2nd administration, strongly suggesting that chimeric mAb 2-4 also induces production of neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb 2-4 when administered at a high dose. A decrease in the therapeutic effect of infliximab due to production of neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb has similarly been reported [7] . However, neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb production can be inhibited by concomitant administration of an anti-inflammatory drug, methotrexate (MTX). MTX suppresses the humoral immune response and is thought to reduce production of antibody against chimeric mAb after infliximab administration [10, 11] . Concomitant MTX administration with chimeric mAb 2-4 may also inhibit production of neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb. Future studies are necessary to investigate the applicability of concomitant MTX administration with chimeric mAb 2-4 in cats with FIP.
In conclusion, we prepared mouse-feline chimeric mAb 2-4 by fusing the variable region of anti-fTNF-alpha mAb 2-4 to the feline antibody constant region and confirmed that it maintained fTNF-alpha neutralization activity. When the chimeric mAb 2-4 was administered to cats, the induction of feline anti-mouse antibody response was decreased compared to that after mouse mAb 2-4 administration. These results warrant further investigation on the dose and dosing frequency of chimeric mAb 2-4 appropriate for effective treatment of cats with FIP.",Development of a mouse-feline chimeric antibody against feline tumor necrosis factor-alpha,"DOKI, Tomoyoshi; TAKANO, Tomomi; HOHDATSU, Tsutomu",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5059372/,192,3816,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,0a1f43c04e0e22fb6efbd94611920bc9680d7ae3,"Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with immunogenetic factors. This study was planned to test for the association of TNF-α − 308 and IFN-γ +874 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility and severity of SLE in Egyptian cases. Subjects and methods: This is a case controlled study including 125 Egyptian cases with SLE in addition to 112 healthy unrelated individuals from the same locality. For all participants, TNF-α − 308 G NA and IFN-γ + 874 ANT genetic polymorphisms were characterized using the PCR technique. Results: Cases with SLE showed a significantly higher TNF-α −308 A allele carriage rate (AA + GA genotypes) compared to controls (26.4% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.009, OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.26-4.99). These cases showed also a significantly higher carriage rate for the IFN-γ +874 T allele (AT + TT genotypes) compared to controls (47.2% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.02, OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.11-3.21). Comparing age, gender, and disease severity presented by nephritis class, activity and chronicity indices in cases carrying the TNF-α −308 A allele and in cases carrying IFN-γ +874 T allele versus others showed no significant difference (p N 0.05). Conclusions: TNF-α −308 A and IFN-γ +874 T allele carriage are associated with susceptibility but not severity of SLE in Egyptian subjects.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototypic autoimmune complex disease which is characterized by excessive production of autoantibodies against a broad range of self-antigens (Gurevitz et al., 2013) . Vital organs and tissues are often implicated, including kidney, brain, cardiovascular, joint and skin (Sánchez et al., 2006) . One of its most severe manifestations is lupus nephritis (LN), which remains a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality, either secondary to kidney disease, or as a result of intense immunosuppressive drug toxicity (Sestak et al., 2007; Hiraki et al., 2012; Pons-Estel et al., 2011) . Genes most likely contribute to the development of lupus have been identified particularly of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) types HLA-A1, B8, and DR3 (Wakeland et al., 2001; Walport et al., 1982) . In addition, there is a strong evidence supporting the role of cytokine genes in the pathogenesis of SLE (Lin et al., 2009 ). One of the major cytokines that has been intensely investigated is the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the inflammatory and immune responses (Aggarwal et al., 2012) . High serum levels of TNF-α have been reported in SLE that correlated well with the renal inflammatory activity (Studnicka-Benke et al., 1996; Aringer et al., 2002; Maury and Teppo, 1989; Postal and Appenzeller, 2011) . Effects of TNF-α were found to be related to activation of a cascade of inflammatory events, enhancing expression of adhesion molecules, activation of neutrophils in addition to acting as a costimulator for T cell activation and antibody production (Serrano et al., 2006) . The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) TNFα −308 GN A (rs1800629) is located on chromosome 6p21.3, within the class III region of MHC. The TNF-α −308 A allele has been reported to be a stronger transcriptional activator in vitro than the common G allele. Therefore, the A allele frequency has been associated with the risk of autoimmune disorders (Zou et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2012) .
Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is one of the main cytokines secreted by activated T lymphocytes and has antiproliferative, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities as it controls the development of T helper 1 (Th1) cells (Silva et al., 1992; Torrico et al., 1991) . Several studies have indicated that expression of the IFN-γ level has significant effects into the susceptibility of various autoimmune diseases. There is a report showing significant increasing IFN-γ messenger ribonucleic acid expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with SLE that might trigger inflammatory responses (Baccala et al., 2005; Meta Gene 9 (2016) 
Meta Gene j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / m g e n e Csiszár et al., 2000) . The human IFN-γ gene located on chromosome 12q24.1 has a SNP in the first intron at its 5′ end, adjacent to a CA repeat region (+ 874 A NT, rs2430561) which was known to influence the secretion of IFN-γ and had been implicated in numerous autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions (Chong et al., 2006; Pravica et al., 2000) . Analysis of the biological role of this SNP suggested that + 874 T allele carriers showed higher production of IFN-γ (Pravica et al., 2000; López-Maderuelo et al., 2003) . The aim of this study is to investigate the association between TNF-α − 308 G N A and IFN-γ + 874 A NT gene polymorphisms with the SLE susceptibility and severity among Egyptian subjects.
This is a case controlled study involving 125 adult patients with SLE all suffering from LN (72 females and 53 males, age mean ± SD = 23.4 ± 4.4 years) and 112 healthy unrelated subjects (46 males and 66 females, age mean ± SD = 28.3 ± 6.2 years). Patients were recruited from the Urology and Nephrology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt. The diagnosis of SLE in patients was according to the American College of Rheumatology (1982) revised criteria for SLE (Tan et al., 1982) . Assessment of the severity of SLE was based upon the classification of LN (Weening et al., 2004) where class I: normal glomeruli (0 cases), class II: purely mesangial disease (8 cases), class III: focal proliferative glomerulonephritis (25 cases), class IV: diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (88 cases), and class V: membranous glomerulonephritis (4 cases). The study was approved by the ethical and scientific committees of Mansoura University. An informed consent was also obtained from all participants before the start of the study.
For all participants, genomic DNA from a peripheral blood was extracted and purified using the kit provided by Gentra Systems, USA. Typing of the TNF-α − 308 G NA (rs1800629) SNP and IFN-γ + 874 ANT (rs2430561) were performed using the polymerase chain reaction with amplification refractory mutation system (PCR-ARMS) as described by Perrey et al. (Perrey et al., 1999) and Pravica et al. (Pravica et al., 2000) respectively. The PCR amplification was carried out using Veriti® thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) in a 20 μl total volume containing about 100 ng of genomic DNA template, 2 pM of each primer, 2 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM of MgCl 2 , 1 × PCR buffer and 0.6 U of Taq DNA polymerase. TNF-α Primer sequences were as follows: TNF-α G forward primer: 5′-ATA GGT TTT GAG GGG CAT GG-3′; TNF-α A forward primer: 5′-AATA GGT TTT GAG GGG CAT GA-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-TCT CGG TTT CTT CTC CAT CG-3′. Reaction conditions were carried out in a thermocycler at 95°C for 1 min followed by 10 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 65°C for 50 s, and 72°C for 40 s and then 20 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 56°C for 50 s, and 72°C for 50 s. On the other hand, primer sequences for INF-γ were as follows: reverse primer: 5′-TCA ACA AAG CTG ATA CTC CA-3′, INF-γ A forward primer: 5′-TTC TTA CAA CAC AAA ATC AAA TCA-3′, INF-γ T forward primer: 5′-TTC TTA CAA CAC AAA ATC AAA TCT-3′. The PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 2 min, 10 cycles of incubation at 95°C for 15 s, 62°C for 50 s and 72°C for 40 s, followed by 20 cycles of incubation at 95°C for 20 s, 56°C for 50 s and 72°C for 50 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The amplified PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining followed by ultraviolet visualization. The PCR product for TNF-α − 308 was detected at 184 bp ( Fig. 1) while that of IFN-γ + 874 was detected at 263 bp (Fig. 2) .
Data were analyzed using the statistical package of social science (SPSS, version 17.0) software program. The frequencies of studied genotypic and allelic polymorphisms among cases were compared to those of controls using Fisher's exact test and odds ratio (OR) with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For statistical analysis, the significance of clinical parameters related to age, gender, SLE classes, severity index and chronicity index was determined by Fisher's exact test. Conformity with the Hardy Weinberg law of genetic equilibrium was tested by Chi square test comparing the observed versus expected genotype frequencies in both groups of cases and controls. A minimum level of statistical significance was considered at a p level of b0.05.
Cases with SLE showed a significantly higher TNF-α −308 (GA + AA genotypes) compared to controls (26.4% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.009, OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.26-4.99) (Table 1) . Similarly, cases showed a significantly higher carriage rate for the IFNG-γ + 874 (AT + TT genotypes) compared to controls (47.2% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.02, OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.11-3.21) ( Table 2) . This was mainly due to the higher frequency of the heterozygous TNF-α GA and INF-γ AT genotypes, consistent with the dominant mode of inheritance. On other hand, comparing the homozygous genotype frequency between cases and control (recessive model) did not yield any significant difference. The frequencies of TNF-α and IFN-γ genotypes were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both groups of SLE cases and controls (p N 0.05) (Tables 1 and 2). Cases of TNF-α GA + AA genotypes vs. those with the GG genotype (1 and 2) represent genotype GA, lanes (3 and 4) represent genotype GA, lanes (5 and 6) represent genotype GA, lanes (7 and 8) represent genotype GA, lanes (9 and 10) represent genotype GA, TNF-α −308 GNA was detected at 184 bp. and those having the INF-γ AT + TT genotypes vs. those with the AA genotype revealed no significant difference regarding their age, gender and nephritis class, activity and chronicity indices (p N 0.05) ( Table 3) .
This study tested the association of two important gene polymorphisms with SLE presenting mainly with nephritis. It showed clearly IFN-γ + 874 T and TNF-α − 308 A alleles are risk alleles for SLE in Egyptian subjects although apparently not affecting the clinical severity of the disease. In another study done among Egyptian SLE patients recruited from Upper Egypt, Ahmed et al. have found a high frequency of the TNF-α −308 A allele in the SLE patients but not in patients with nephritis (Ahmed et al., 2014) .
Recent meta-analysis has shown also that individuals carrying TNF-α −308 A risk allele were significantly associated with SLE in European, South American and Mexican subjects but was not associated with SLE in Asian and African subjects (Pan et al., 2012) . Similar conclusion regarding the association of TNF-α − 308 A allele was also found among Brazilian (Angelo et al., 2012) , Colombian (Guarnizo-Zuccardi et al., 2007) , Mexican (Jiménez-Morales et al., 2009) , North American (Parks et al., 2004) , Spanish (Suárez et al., 2005) , Asian (Lin et al., 2009) and Caucasian (van der Linden et al., 2001) patients. This might be explained by the fact that TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in different immune-regulated diseases including autoimmune, infectious, and malignant ones (Lee et al., 2006) .
Regarding the other polymorphism, we could find that a few number of articles were done to analyze the relationship between the IFN-γ +874 ANT SNP and susceptibility to SLE. For instance, Kim et al. found an association between the + 874 A N T IFN-γ polymorphism and SLE patients in Korean patients (Kim et al., 2010) . This might be also explained by the fact that IFN-γ is an important cytokine produced in response to inflammatory stimuli to regulate the human immune response. It was believed that the pathogenesis of SLE involves the over-production of IFN-γ (Bennett et al., 2003) . It has been postulated that genetic polymorphisms affecting cytokine transcription exist in the regulatory regions of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, and that such polymorphisms may control the level of inflammation (Baechler et al., 2003) . In addition, the positive association was found between the amino acid polymorphism (Val14Met) within the IFN-γ receptor 1 gene and SLE. Several studies have indicated that alterable expression of the IFN-γ level has significant effects to the susceptibility of various autoimmune diseases, particularly in SLE (Csiszár et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 1999) . Nonetheless, other studies found contradictory results of no association of TNF-α − 308 G NA polymorphism with SLE among Argentinean (Muñoz et al., 2014) , Mexican (Zúñiga et al., 2001) , Japanese (Takeuchi et al., 2005) , Colombian (Tobón et al., 2005) , African Americans (Parks et al., 2004 ), Italian (D'Alfonso et al., 1996 , Chinese (Fong et al., 1996) , Thai and Portuguese (Santos et al., 2012) patients. In spite of the above evidence, we have encountered two studies stating a non-association of IFN-γ +874 T allele and SLE among Thai and Brazilian subjects (Tangwattanachuleeporn et al., 2007; da Silva et al., 2014) . (1 and 2) represent genotype AT, lanes (3 and 4) represent genotype TT, lanes (5 and 6) represent genotype AT, lanes (7 and 8) represent genotype AT, lanes (9 and 10) represent genotype TT, lanes (11 and 12) represent genotype AT, IFN-γ +874 ANT was detected at 263 bp. ⁎ p b 0.05 = significant. ** p b 0.01 highly significant. ⁎ p b 0.05 = significant. ** p b 0.01 highly significant.
These contradictory results might be attributed to different ethnic origins in addition to diverse genetic and epigenetic interactions with different environmental effects. The relatively small sample size might also present other limiting factor. Lastly, we can conclude that TNF-α − 308 G N A and IFN-γ +874 ANT gene polymorphisms might play a role in the susceptibility but not the severity and activity of lupus in Egyptian cases. However, taking into consideration the limiting factors, we recommend undertaking a wide-scale multicenter study into the entire genome sequence studying all cytokine gene polymorphisms and their expression status in cases of SLE.",TNF-α − 308 G > A and IFN-γ + 874 A > T gene polymorphisms in Egyptian patients with lupus erythematosus,"Al-Kholy, Wfaa; Elsaid, Afaf; Sleem, Aml; Fathy, Hend; Elshazli, Rami; Settin, Ahmad",Meta Gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909826/,214,2158,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,7d9c27d988dd4ca25668f573e610145140d2266e,"The World Health Organization (WHO) published 2 alcohol-based formulations to be used in healthcare settings and for outbreak-associated infections, but inactivation efficacies of these products have not been determined against (re-)emerging viruses. In this study, we evaluated the virucidal activity of these WHO products in a comparative analysis. Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as (re-)emerging viral pathogens and other enveloped viruses could be efficiently inactivated by both WHO formulations, implicating their use in healthcare systems and viral outbreak situations.","Hygienic hand antisepsis is one of the most important measures in preventing healthcare-and outbreak-associated viral infections. To reduce the spread of infections, biocides with a proven virucidal efficacy should be readily available. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed in its 2009 Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care the use of of 2 alcohol-based hand rubs (formulation I and formulation II) for surgical and hygiene hand disinfection in healthcare settings and to reduce the transmission of pathogens by hands [1] . However, limited data exist on the efficacy of disinfectants, including the WHO formulations, against novel viruses that have emerged during recent outbreaks in different parts of the world. Most recently, Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus that was discovered originally in Africa, has raised considerable international concern. In 2013, the largest and most complex outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV), a filovirus that spreads mainly through contact with body fluids of symptomatic patients or contaminated surfaces, occurred in West Africa [2] . One year previously in 2012, a novel Coronavirus (CoV) named Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged, preceded by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003, with both viruses causing acute respiratory diseases in humans and displaying a high case-fatality rate.
We previously evaluated the WHO formulations in a quantitative suspension test for chemical disinfectants and antiseptics in human medicine using different nonenveloped model viruses and observed that formulation I demonstrated a better activity than formulation II against these nonenveloped viruses [3] . However, at that time neither formulation met the requirements for virucidal activity against poliovirus according to the European Guideline (EN14476) [3] or for surgical hand treatment according to the European Norm (EN12971) [4] . Since then, both WHO formulations have been modified with higher alcohol content and lower glycerol concentration and are now fulfilling the guideline requirements [5, 6] .
In this study, we evaluated for the first time the modified WHO-recommended alcohol-based formulations against different enveloped viruses, including emerging ZIKV, EBOV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV and performed a comparative inactivation analysis of these emerging viruses and other important reference viruses.
An overview of the viruses and cell culture systems used in this study is given in Supplementary Table 1. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chimeric Jc1 virus was generated in the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7.5) as previously described [7] . The African lineage ZIKV strain (MP1751), isolated in Uganda in 1962, was propagated by using Vero-B4 cells like MERS-CoV strain EMC and SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt 1. Bovine CoV (BcoV) was produced in the human glioblastoma astrocytoma cells U373, human influenza A virus (H1N1) was produced in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) and modified vaccinia Ankara strain (MVA) was produced in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21). Ebola virus was propagated in Vero E6 cells as previously described [8] . Ebola virus-like particles encoding a luciferase were generated using 239T cells as previously reported [9] . In general, cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium or Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and other additions (Supplementary Table 1 ).
One part by volume of the test virus suspension and 1 part by volume of the organic load were mixed with 8 parts by volume of 1 of the 2 WHO formulations at different concentrations. Additional information is provided in the Supplementary Data.
Concentrations at which the formulations reached the half maximal virus inactivation effective concentration (EC 50 ) were determined using nonlinear regression using the robust fitting method on the normalized 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) data implemented in GraphPad Prism version 6.07 for Windows. The mean TCID 50 of 2 individual experiments and standard deviations of means were also calculated using GraphPad Prism. Significance of differences in mean EC 50 obtained for the viruses between WHO formulations I and II was tested using 2-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (P < .01).
Hepatitis C virus and ZIKV both belong to the family of Flaviviridae (Supplementary Table 1 ) but are transmitted in the environment by different routes. Whereas HCV is a blood-borne virus [10] , transmission of ZIKV occurs mainly through mosquitos, with the most important and common vectors being the Aedes genus. However, other modes of transmission, including sexual transmission, have been reported. To determine the efficacy of WHO formulations I and II against HCV and ZIKV, we incubated the 2 viruses for 30 seconds with the formulations at final concentrations ranging from 10% to 80% ( Figure 1 ). In the case of HCV, viral titers started to decline at a concentration of 30% with WHO formulation II and 40% with WHO formulation I and were reduced to background levels at a concentration of 60% with WHO formulation I and at 40% with WHO formulation II, respectively ( Figure 1A ). As depicted in Figure 1B , a dose-dependent reduction of viral titers was also observed for ZIKV ( Figure 1B) . Importantly, viral titers of 10 6 TCID 50 /mL in the control decreased to undetectable levels with WHO formulation I at a concentration of 40%, whereas a concentration of only 30% was required for complete inactivation with WHO forumulation II.
Coronavirus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronoavirus to
Next, we investigated the susceptibility of emerging respiratory CoVs against the WHO formulations in the same experimental suspension assay setup. As reference for CoVs, which can be cultivated under lower biosafety levels, we included BCoV that naturally infects cattle. As depicted in Supplementary Figure 1A , WHO formulation II at a 30% concentration was sufficient to completely inactivate BCoV, whereas for WHO formulation I higher concentrations of at least 40% were required (Supplementary Figure 1A) . Similar inactivation profiles could be observed for MERS-CoV ( Figure 1C ) and SARS-CoV ( Figure 1D ), demonstrating a high susceptibility of these emerging CoVs to WHO formulations. Furthermore, these results implicate BCoV as a valid surrogate virus for inactivation studies with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Work with infectious EBOV is restricted to biosafety level 4 laboratories, significantly limiting studies with these viruses. In 2014, Watt et al reported a novel life cycle modelling approach for EBOV, which can be performed at biosafety level 2 laboratories [9] . Inactivation of these transcriptionand replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) with WHO formulations showed a dose-dependent reduction of trVLP reporter activity with increasing WHO formulation I and II concentrations ( Figure 2A ). Next, we tested full infectious EBOV cultured at biosafety level 4 for its susceptibility to WHO formulations for potential usage in outbreak situations. Interestingly, viral titers of 10 7 TCID 50 /mL in the control were reduced to background levels at concentrations of 40% with WHO formulation II and 60% with WHO formulation I, showing again a superior virucidal activity of WHO formulation II compared with WHO formulation I ( Figure 2B ). We also included the influenza A virus H1N1 in these inactivation experiments because of its importance in causing viral respiratory epidemics and pandemics. H1N1 could be inactivated at concentrations of 60% with WHO formulation I and 40% with WHO formulation II (Supplementary Figure 1B) . Furthermore, MVA was studied for its susceptibility to WHO formulations because it is the chosen test virus for all enveloped viruses in the European Guideline. In line with EBOV and H1N1, similar inactivation profiles could be observed with increasing WHO formulation I and II concentrations (Supplementary Figure 1C) .
Based on the obtained virucidal activities of the WHO formulations against the different enveloped viruses, we next analyzed the inactivation profiles in a comparative analysis ( Figure 2C and 2D) . The most susceptible viruses to the WHO formulation I were the bovine and emerging CoVs (BCoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) and ZIKV ( Figure 2C ). With a shift to increasing WHO forumation I concentration, the more stable viruses included the full infectious EBOV (trVLPs excluded in this analysis) and HCV ( Figure 2C ). The highest alcohol-based concentrations of WHO formulation I (>40%) were required for H1N1 and MVA, which displayed nearly identical inactivation response curves ( Figure 2C ). The results for the isopropanol-based WHO formulation II are depicted in Figure 2D ; it demonstrated a similar pattern of susceptibility for the different enveloped viruses with an obvious shift toward lower concentrations ( Figure 2D ). The CoVs and ZIKV showed the highest susceptibility to WHO formulation II, whereas HCV, EBOV, H1N1 and MVA demonstrated a more resistant inactivation profile ( Figure 2D ). To also directly compare the performance of the 2 WHO formulations, we determined the concentrations at which the products reached the EC 50 (Supplementary Figure 2) . World Health Organization formulation II showed a significantly higher virucidal activity against the different viruses compared with WHO formulation I (P = .008). In summary, CoVs and ZIKV showed the highest susceptibility to WHO formulations. Ebola virus and HCV were observed to be less susceptible than the CoVs, whereas H1N1 and MVA were the most stable viruses. In addition, WHO formulation II demonstrated a higher virucidal effect compared with WHO formulation I. The WHO has recommended 2 formulations in Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care, a document proposing the use of cheap alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce the transmission of pathogens [1] . We aimed in this study to analyze the virucidal efficacies of these products, particularly against emerging or re-emerging viruses that caused severe epidemics in the recent past [2] . Importantly, both WHO formulations inactivated all tested viruses, including ZIKV, EBOV, and emerging CoVs, in a suspension test with 30-second exposure time, implicating the formulations I and II were tested for their efficacy in inactivating EBOV transcription-and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) (A) and EBOV (B). The biocide concentrations ranged from 0% to 80% with an exposure time of 30 seconds. For this inactivation assay, 1 part virus and 1 part organic load were mixed with 8 parts of biocide. For determination of the EBOV trVLP infectivity, luciferase activity was measured 72 hours later. For EBOV, residual infectivity was determined by a limiting dilution assay. Viral titers are displayed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) values. The cytotoxicity was calculated in analogy to the determination of virus titer (TCID 50 /mL) and is depicted as a dashed line. The means of 2 independent experiments with standard deviations are shown. Normalized values of percentage inactivation of viral infectivity (y-axis) were plotted against WHO formulations I (C) or II (D) in dose-response curves (x-axis, log representation). Viruses are listed in each panel and are ranked from the most to the least stable. Normalization and nonlinear regression calculation of all data were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.07 for Windows. Abbreviation: nd, not detected. usability of these formulations in viral outbreak situations. In the case of ZIKV, specific viral inactivation data are lacking, and consequently disinfection guidelines are based on data obtained from other members of the flaviviruses. So far, 1 recent study by Müller et al reported that ZIKV was inactivated by classical inactivation methods including ultraviolet light [11] . Zika virus was readily reduced in viral titers by the WHO formulations, similar to the other member of the family of Flaviviridae, HCV. These findings are supported by earlier analyses of the environmental stability and inactivation profiles of HCV, which showed strong virucidal effects of the main WHO formulation ingredients ethanol and isopropanol [12] . For EBOV, limited data on the efficacy of virucidal products are available because these viruses require high biosafety level laboratories. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises ""suitable disinfectant solutions include 0.5% sodium hypochloride as well as 2% glutaraldehyde and phenolic disinfectants (0.5-3%)"" for EBOV inactivation [13] . The comparative inactivation analyses of all viruses tested revealed that the CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV, were the most susceptible viruses to WHO formulation treatment. The degree of susceptibility of the different viruses to the WHO formulation likely depends on the specific surface properties of the lipophilic envelope of the respective virus. We could show by a comparative inactivation analysis that H1N1 and MVA showed the highest stability against alcohol-based inactivation, with higher concentrations of WHO formulation I and II being required compared with CoVs, ZIKV, and EBOV. These results confirm MVA as the model surrogate virus for all enveloped viruses for testing chemical disinfectants and antiseptics in human medicine [8] . When testing nonenveloped viruses like noro-, polio-, or adenovirus, a far higher level of resistance to both WHO formulations was observed, probably due to the more hydrophilic character of these viruses [3, 6] . Interestingly, WHO formulation I was superior compared with WHO formulation II in inactivating these nonenveloped viruses, whereas in this study the opposite effect occurred, with WHO formulation II showing a higher virucidal activity against enveloped viruses. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of the virus envelope, which likely renders enveloped viruses more susceptible to the isopropanol-based WHO formulation II compared with the ethanol-based WHO formulation I [14] . Furthermore, isopropanol has 1 more carbon than ethanol, giving it greater lipophilic properties and higher virucidal activities against lipophilic viruses [15] .
In conclusion, WHO-recommended alcohol-based formulations were validated with different enveloped viruses. A strong virucidal effect against emerging pathogens, including ZIKV, EBOV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, could be demonstrated, implicating the usability of these WHO formulations in healthcare and outbreak-associated viral infections.

Materials and Methods: As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). Conclusion: COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.","https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0132 kjronline.org COVID-19 patient was identified in South Korea (hereafter, Korea) on January 20, 2020. As of February 16, there were 29 COVID-19 patients in Korea, placing Korea in fifth place internationally in terms of the number of COVID-19 patients, after China, Singapore (72 patients), Japan (53 patients), and Thailand (34 patients). Deaths have almost exclusively occurred in China (1666 patients; 3.3%), rather than outside China (3 patients; 0.4%). The discrepancy in the death rate between China and other countries might be due to differences in the disease manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia or in other countries' capacity to manage a limited number of cases, in contrast to the overwhelming numbers of cases in China.
Early radiologic investigations consistently reported that the typical computed tomography (CT) findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with a peripheral and posterior lung distribution (4) (5) (6) . The current publications on this topic are exclusively from China, and it remains unknown how COVID-19 pneumonia appears on chest radiographs and CT images of patients outside China. Therefore, we present a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea.
This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the participating hospitals, and the requirement for informed consent was waived.
On February 6, 2020, the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology proposed a multi-institutional collaboration for reporting the radiologic findings of COVID-19. Seven members with different affiliations decided to participate in this study, and the working group submitted a document for review by the Institutional Review Board of each affiliated hospital. Due to between-hospital differences in the required period for Institutional Review Board review, we expedited the process to report cases for which approval was received, while excluding cases under review. Consequently, we included nine consecutive patients (median age, 54 years; four men and five women) with COVID-19 infections confirmed through a pan-coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction assay from January 2020 through February 9, 2020 from Incheon Medical Center (7), Seoul National University Hospital, and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.
All CT examinations were performed using a multidetector CT scanner with 64 or more channels (Somatom Definition, Somatom Definition AS+, or Somatom Force, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). The detailed parameters for CT acquisition were as follows: tube voltage, 120 kVp; tube current, standard (reference mAs, 60-120) to low-dose (reference mAs, 30) with automatic exposure control; slice thickness, 1.0 mm; reconstruction interval, 1.0-3.0 mm; and a sharp reconstruction kernel. CT images were obtained with the patient in the supine position at full inspiration and without contrast medium.
All patients underwent a baseline digital anteroposterior chest radiography at full inspiration using a mobile chest radiograph machine (FLUOROSPOT Compact FD, Siemens Healthineers; DRX-Revolution Mobile X-ray System, Carestream Health, Rochester, NY, USA; or Optima XR220, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA).
Eight of the nine patients had parenchymal abnormalities on their baseline chest CT scans. In another patient, the baseline chest CT scan was normal, and parenchymal abnormalities were observed on a follow-up CT scan one week later. Accordingly, we analyzed eight baseline chest CT scans and one follow-up CT scan with abnormal findings of COVID-19 pneumonia.
Two attending radiologists (with 15 and 12 years of experience in chest imaging, respectively) reviewed the chest radiographs and CT images by consensus on a picture archiving and communication system (PACS, INFINITT Healthcare co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea). The readers assessed the presence, location, and density of parenchymal abnormalities on chest radiographs without reviewing the CT images, and graded the abnormalities using the following 5-point scale (8): 1, normal; 2, patchy atelectasis and/or hyperinflation and/or bronchial wall thickening; 3, focal alveolar consolidation involving no more than one segment or one lobe; 4, multifocal consolidation; and 5, diffuse alveolar consolidation. After the initial assessment of the chest radiographs, we checked whether the abnormalities on chest radiographs corresponded to abnormalities on chest CT images.
The CT images were evaluated with both lung (width, 1500 HU; level, -600 HU) and mediastinal (width, 400 https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0132 kjronline.org HU; level, 40 HU) window settings. The readers identified all separate pulmonary lesions on CT and analyzed the longest diameter, location, shape, density, and margin of the lesions. The locations of the lesions were specified as lobar, axial, and anteroposterior. For the axial location, the peripheral lung was defined as the outer one-third of the lung, and the central lung was defined as the inner twothirds of the lung. According to a horizontal line dividing the lung into anterior and posterior halves, locations were classified as anterior or posterior. The shapes of the lesions were first categorized as patchy, confluent, or nodular. Patchy lesions were defined as isolated focal lesions with no nodular shape in the segment, and confluent lesions were defined as large fused lesions involving multiple segments. The densities of the patchy to confluent lesions were classified as pure GGO, mixed GGO and consolidation, consolidation, or a crazy-paving appearance. The densities of the nodular lesions were classified as pure GGO, partsolid, or solid. The margins of the lesions were dichotomized as ill-defined or well-defined. We evaluated whether the pulmonary lesions had a predilection for the lower lobes, pleura, or bronchovascular bundles. Furthermore, the readers evaluated the presence of air-bronchograms, the reversed halo sign, cavities, micronodules, a tree-in-bud appearance, and pleural effusion based on the Fleischner Society glossary of terms for thoracic imaging (9) .
Fisher's exact test was used to compare patchy to confluent lesions and nodular lesions in terms of the proportion of pure GGO lesions, axial location, anteroposterior location, margin, and predilection for the lower lobes, pleura, and bronchovascular bundles. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). P values < 0.05 were considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Five of the nine patients showed radiographic abnormalities (severity grade 2, one patient; grade 3, two patients; and grades 4 and 5, one patient each). Chest CT scans revealed that the grade 2 lesion and one of the grade 3 lesions as areas of prominent breast tissue mimicking faint GGO and post-inflammatory focal atelectasis on chest radiography, respectively. In summary, three of the nine patients (33.3%) were confirmed to have parenchymal abnormalities related to COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs (Figs. 1A, 2A, 3A).
One of the three patients had a single nodular opacity in the left lower lung zone (Fig. 3A) , and the other two patients had four and five patchy opacities in both lungs (Figs. 1A, 2A), respectively (Table 1 ). In a per-lesion analysis, 50% of the 10 opacities presented in the lower lung zones, 80% of the opacities were located in the peripheral lungs, and 70% of the opacities were areas of consolidation.
In total, 77 lung parenchymal lesions were identified in the nine patients, of whom eight had bilateral kjronline.org lung parenchymal abnormalities. The median numbers of parenchymal lesions and involved lobes were 5 (interquartile range, 2-13) and 2 (interquartile range, 2-5), respectively. The most frequently involved lobe was the right lower lobe (eight patients), followed by the left upper and lower lobes (six patients each). Among the 77 identified lesions, 39% were patchy, 13% were confluent, and 48% were nodular ( Table 2 ). The average diameters of the patchy, confluent, and nodular lesions were 2.6 ± 1.5 cm, 9.8 ± 2.6 cm, and 1.3 ± 0.6 cm, respectively. The peripheral and posterior lung were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. Patchy to confluent lesions were more prevalent than nodular lesions per patient (median relative proportion of patchy to confluent lesions, 86% [interquartile range, 33-100%]). Patchy to confluent lesions primarily manifested as mixed GGO and consolidative lesions (50%) (Fig. 1B, C) , followed by pure GGO lesions (35%) (Fig. 2B, C) , lesions with a crazy-paving appearance (10%), and areas of consolidation (5%). The most frequent shape of the lesions was wedgeshaped (42%), followed by elongated (33%) and confluent (25%). They frequently had an ill-defined margin (70%) and kjronline.org 28% of the lesions had an air-bronchogram. Nodular lesions primarily manifested as pure GGO lesions (57%), followed by predominantly GGO lesions (32%) and predominantly solid lesions (11%). Nodular lesions were round (95%) and had ill-defined margins (75%). There were no cavities, micronodules, lesions with a tree-in-bud appearance, or pleural effusions. Compared to nodular lesions, patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed along the pleura (80% vs. 35%; p < 0.001) and more commonly involved the lower lobes (60% vs. 35%; p = 0.040) (Fig. 4A) . The nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (59% vs. 28%; p = 0.006) (Fig. 4B ) and tended to manifest as pure GGO lesions (57% vs. 35%; p = 0.069).
The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia has resulted in a global health emergency, similar to the outbreaks of severe (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , with a predominance of bilateral GGO and consolidative lesions in the peripheral lung. Despite the similarities in CT findings, COVID-19 pneumonia seems radiologically milder than SARS and MERS pneumonia. The proportion of patients with abnormal initial radiographic findings was 78.3-82.4% in SARS (15, 16) and 83.6% in MERS (17), but only 33% in our cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. GGO lesions on CT without any consolidation presented in 45% of our cases and in 45-67% of Chinese COVID-19 patients (4, 5) , in 14-40% of MERS patients (10, 11) , and in 50% of SARS patients (12) . The CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea were generally consistent with those of COVID-19 pneumonia in China (4) (5) (6) 18) . However, the proportion of predominantly consolidative lesions in Chinese patients was approximately 30% (4) to 60% (5), but the Korean patients did not have predominantly consolidative lesions. Furthermore, the proportion of chest radiographic abnormalities was 60% in Chinese COVID-19 patients (19) , but 33% in Korean patients. Considering these radiologic observations and the lack of deaths from COVID-19 in Korea, Korean patients seem to experience a milder disease course than Chinese patients.
Interestingly, we observed a reversed halo sign in one patient (Fig. 3B) , and a few similar cases have been reported in recent reports (19) (20) (21) . The reversed halo sign was first regarded as specific for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and it can be seen in various infectious diseases, including angioinvasive pulmonary aspergillosis or mucormycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and tuberculosis (22) . This sign might reflect an organizing pneumonia pattern in COVID-19 pneumonia (21) .
A few limitations exist in this study. First, the number of included patients was small, and the included patients only accounted for approximately one-third of all 29 identified patients of COVID-19 in Korea as of February 16, 2020. Including more patients would enable a more comprehensive description of the radiologic findings of COVID-19. However, we weighed this consideration against the importance of urgent reporting. Second, we focused on baseline CT findings that clinicians and radiologists first encountered, rather than findings from follow-up CT scans, as follow-up CT scans were performed in few patients. Third, we minimized the clinical information of the patients, as a substantial proportion of the included patients were receiving inpatient treatment at the time of the analysis.
In conclusion, COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea generally manifested as pure GGO to mixed GGO and consolidative lesions in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. The shape of the lesions was typically ill-defined and patchy to confluent, or nodular. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed along the pleura, whereas nodular lesions were mainly distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. Most of the pulmonary lesions were ambiguous on chest radiographs.

For technical reasons, it has previously been difficult to determine their precise distribution on different cell types. Using a recombinant soluble form of the Influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase as a probe for 9-O -acetylated sialic acids, we demonstrate here their preferential expression on the CD4 T cell lineage in normal B10.A mouse lymphoid organs. Of total thymocytes, 8-10% carry 9-O -acetylation; the great majority of these are the more mature PNA Ϫ , HSA Ϫ , and TCR hi medullary cells. While low levels of 9-O -acetylation are seen on some CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) and CD8 single positive (SP) cells, high levels are present primarily on 80-85% of CD4 SP cells. Correlation with CD4 and CD8 levels suggests that 9-O -acetylation appears as an early differentiation marker as cells mature from the DP to the CD4 SP phenotype. This high degree of 9-O -acetylation is also present on 90-95% of peripheral spleen and lymph node CD4 T cells. In contrast, only a small minority of CD8 T cells and B cells show such levels of 9-O -acetylation. Among mature peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes, the highly O -acetylated cells are Mel 14 hi , CD44 lo , and CD45R(exon B) hi , features typical of naive cells. Digestions with trypsin and O -sialoglycoprotease (OSGPase) and ELISA studies of lipid extracts indicate that the 9-O -acetylated sialic acids on peripheral CD4 T cells are predominantly on O-linked mucintype glycoproteins and to a lesser degree, on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides). In contrast, sialic acids on mucin type molecules of CD8 T cells are not O -acetylated; instead these molecules mask the recognition of O -acetylated gangliosides that seem to be present at similar levels as on CD4 cells. The 9-O -acetylated gangliosides on mouse T cells are not bound by CD60 antibodies, which recognize O -acetylated gangliosides in human T cells. Tethering 9-O -acetylated mucins with the Influenza C probe with or without secondary cross-linking did not cause activation of CD4 T cells. However, activation by other stimuli including TCR ligation is associated with a substantial decrease in surface 9-O -acetylation, primarily in the mucin glycoprotein component. Thus, 9-O -acetylation of sialic acids on cell surface mucins is a novel marker on CD4 T cells that appears on maturation and is modulated downwards upon activation.",,9-O-Acetylation of Sialomucins: A Novel Marker of Murine CD4 T Cells that Is Regulated during Maturation and Activation,"Krishna, Murli; Varki, Ajit",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2196344/,394,9024,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,6bbd4c83266579a2afbe995cf64f3200d4d4cb7b,"Cross-species transmission of viruses poses a sustained threat to public health. Due to increased contact between humans and other animal species the possibility exists for cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. By using conventional PCR amplification and next generation sequencing, we obtained 130 partial or full genome kobuvirus sequences from humans in a sentinel cohort in Vietnam and various mammalian hosts including bats, rodents, pigs, cats, and civets. The evolution of kobuviruses in different hosts was analysed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We estimated and compared time of origin of kobuviruses in different host orders; we also examined the cross-species transmission of kobuviruses within the same host order and between different host orders. Our data provide new knowledge of rodent and bat kobuviruses, which are most closely related to human kobuviruses. The novel bat kobuviruses isolated from bat roosts in Southern Vietnam were genetically distinct from previously described bat kobuviruses, but closely related to kobuviruses found in rodents. We additionally found evidence of frequent cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses within rodents. Overall, our phylogenetic analyses reveal multiple cross-species transmissions both within and among mammalian species, which increases our understanding of kobuviruses genetic diversity and the complexity of their evolutionary history.","Many human pathogens that are of current public health concern are zoonotic or originate from domestic or wild animals before adapting to humans (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Zhuo and Feschotte 2015) . Pathogens that infect multiple host species are more likely to emerge in human populations than host-restricted pathogens (Taylor, Latham, and Woolhouse 2001) . It is therefore important to understand the genetic diversity of viruses circulating in both human and animal populations and to identify possible cross-species transmissions.
Aichi Virus A-1 (hereafter 'AiV-A1') is one of several recently discovered enteric viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans which belongs to the Kobuvirus genus (Yamashita et al. 1991) . Kobuviruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome 6.9-8.4 kb in length. The genome structure is composed of a leader protein (L), followed by structural capsid proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1) and nonstructural proteins (2 A-2 C and 3 A-3 D) (Yamashita et al. 1998 (Yamashita et al. , 2003 Ng et al. 2012) . To date, kobuviruses have been found in multiple host taxa including humans, lagomorpha (rabbits), chiroptera (bats), rodentia, artiodactyla, carnivora, and aves, as well as in environmental samples (Yamashita et al. 2003; Reuter et al. 2008 Reuter et al. , 2010 Kapoor et al. 2011a; Wu et al. 2012; Lodder et al. 2013; Smits et al. 2013; Oem et al. 2014; Pankovics et al. 2015 Pankovics et al. , 2016 . Kobuviruses are currently grouped into six different species (AiV A to F) and unassigned kobuviruses according to the latest report of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (https://talk.ictvonline. org/taxonomy/). However, it is still unclear whether the broad host range of kobuviruses is indicative of cross-species transmission events. Additionally, there may be novel and unknown kobuviruses present in other host species; their existence may increase the scope for further transmission events between animals and humans.
Vietnam has a large human population and high livestock density (Gerber et al. 2005) . Approximately half of the Vietnamese population participate in small-scale animal production (GSO 2013; Rabaa et al. 2015) . Many smallholdings have minimum biosecurity and house several different animal species within a small area. Housing different animal species within a single enclosure creates an environment where interspecies transmission of pathogens may be more likely. In addition, eating wild animals that have been hunted and commercial wildlife farming (such as bamboo rats, civets, porcupines, wild boars, and bats) are both popular in Vietnam as a result of population growth and urban prosperity (Cooper 1995; Drury 2011; Deutsch and Murakhver 2012) . Such activities increase the likelihood of pathogen transfer between wildlife, humans and domestic animals (Krause 1994) .
VIZIONS (The Vietnamese Initiative for Zoonotic Infections) is a multidisciplinary project aiming to understand the emergence of zoonotic viral pathogens by analysing virus populations in: 1, hospitalised patients, 2, people who maintain regular contact with animals, and 3, diverse animal populations (Rabaa et al. 2015) . The aim of this study, conducted with VIZIONS, was to describe the genetic diversity of currently circulating kobuviruses in human and non-human hosts in Vietnam. In particular, we aimed to investigate the likelihood of putative cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses.
The VIZIONS project instigated the collection of faecal samples from diarrheal patients admitted to Dong Thap Provincial hospital in southern Vietnam (n ¼ 671) along with rectal swabs and fecal samples from people who had occupational or residential exposure to animals (a 'high risk' cohort) from November 2012 to May 2016 (n ¼ 551). Faecal samples and rectal swabs from domestic pigs (n ¼ 278) and farmed wild boars (n ¼ 7) were also collected. Rodent faecal samples (n ¼ 315) were collected from rats that were purchased at the local wet market. Bat faecal samples (n ¼ 179) were collected from roosting sites. Faecal samples from 45 dogs and 13 cats that belonged to members of the high-risk cohort were also collected (Carrique-Mas et al. 2015) .
In total 2,059 samples were subjected to a viral diagnostic algorithm and put through a next generation sequencing (NGS) process (Rabaa et al. 2015) . Samples were enriched for viruses, after which nucleic acid was extracted (de Vries et al. 2011 (de Vries et al. , 2012 . All nucleic acids were transcribed and subjected to second strand synthesis. Prepared dsDNA were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. The resulting dsDNA from each sample was sheared and fractionated to 400-500 bp in length, after which Illumina adapters with a unique barcode were ligated to the fragments. Resulting libraries were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq platforms to generate 3-4 million 250 bp pairedend reads per sample (Munnink et al. 2017 ). The quality of the reads was assessed using FASTQC (Davis et al. 2013) . Primers and lower quality bases were trimmed using Cutadapt (Marcel 2011) . Read pairs likely to have derived from host organisms (limited to humans, pigs and rodents), bacteria or archaea were identified and removed with Kraken (Wood and Salzberg 2014) . De novo assembly on remaining read pairs (presumed viral) was conducted using CLC Assembly Cell V 5.0.4 (https://www.qiagen bioinformatics.com/products/clc-assembly-cell/). The resultant contigs were compared with the NCBI GenBank nt database using BLASTn.
Additionally, we obtained kobuvirus sequences from a second VIZIONS study, which exploited PCR screening for multiple viruses in rodents and civets in Vietnam in April and May 2014. In this study, 375 rats were trapped from four different provinces: Dong Thap, Long An, An Giang, and Dak Lak. An additional 32 bamboo rats and 30 civets were purchased from farms in Dak Lak province. Faecal samples and tissue samples (e.g. liver, spleen, and lung) were aseptically collected during postmortem and stored in sterile tubes at À20 C. RNA was extracted from 10% (w/v) of faecal sample suspension using a MagNA Pure 96 Viral NA small volume kit (Roche) and an automated extractor (Roche) as described previously (Van Dung et al. 2014 ). Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, UK) following the manufacturer recommendations. cDNA was screened for kobuviruses using a nested PCR protocol with generic primers targeting the VP1 region (Van Dung et al. 2016) . Characterization of viral sequences in PCR amplification positive samples was performed by sequencing of the VP1 region using primers defined in Supplementary Table S1 .
Newly identified sequences were aligned with kobuvirus reference sequences from NCBI database using ClustalW (Larkin et al. 2007 ). We used SSE V1.3 software to calculate uncorrected distance of new sequences against reference sequences (Simmonds 2012 
We estimated the phylogenies of the dated samples using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which was implemented using the Bayesian evolutionary analysis in BEAST v.1.8.2 (Drummond et al. 2012) . Different combinations of substitution models, clock models and population size models were evaluated by using the path sampling sampling to estimate marginal likelihoods (Baele et al. 2012) . The best fitting model was a general time-reversible model with a gamma distribution (G) across sites as the substitution model, with an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock model and with a constant size coalescent process prior over the phylogenies. The MCMC chains were run for 100 million iterations with sub-sampling every 10,000 iterations and 10% burn-in. MCMC convergence and effective sample size of parameter estimates were evaluated using Tracer 1.5 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk). Our sequence data were obtained from samples collected over a short time period (within 5 years) so cannot be used to generate robust estimates of the substitution rate and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). Therefore, we applied an informative prior on the substitution rate parameter using a normal distribution (mean rate ¼ 2 Â 10 À3 substitutions/site/ year; SD ¼5 Â 10 À4 ) based on published evolution rates of the VP1 gene of related picornaviruses in both humans and nonhumans, as is fully described in our previous study (Lu et al. 2016 ). An asymmetric model with Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable selection (BSSVS) was applied to identify statistically significant transition rates between host species and geographic locations. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were summarized using Tree Annotator and visualized using FigTree v1.4.0 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
We obtained in total 130 partial genome sequences of kobuviruses from six different host populations in Vietnam: humans, pigs, rodents, bats, cats, and civets. PCR screening identified a high prevalence of kobuviruses in bamboo rats (81%; 26/32), rats (21%; 77/375), and civets (17%; 5/30). Sixty-three VP1 gene sequences were then amplified from bamboo rats (n ¼ 23), rats (n ¼ 39), and civets (n ¼ 1) from samples which were PCR positive for kobuviruses. From the 2,097 extractions subjected to NGS, we detected 157 kobuvirus RNA sequences from total contigs with HSPs (high-scoring segment pairs) scores !500 by running BLASTn. The highest prevalence of kobuviruses was in bats (44%, 78/179), followed sequentially by rats (17%, 55/315), cats (15%, 2/13), and pigs (8%, 22/285). Kobuviruses had a much lower prevalence in humans (0.8%, 11/1, 222) than in the other mammalian species except in dogs (0, 0/45). From these contigs we obtained 19 kobuvirus genome sequences with length >5,000 bp and an additional 48 VP1 gene sequences with length 500-831 bp.
We next reconstructed a Bayesian MCMC tree for 416 kobuvirus VP1 sequences isolated from 7 different host orders and 15 countries, including newly identified Vietnamese sequences in this study (n ¼ 130) and all available kobuvirus sequences with full length VP1 (n ¼ 286) retrieved from GenBank (Supplementary Table S2 ). The kobuviruses VP1 sequences in our study clustered together with previously isolated kobuviruses from the same host taxon: human-derived kobuviruses fell into the AiV-A1 clade; pig-derived sequences fell into Clade AiV-C1; cat-derived kobuviruses grouped with the other feline kobuvirus sequences in Clade AiV-A4; the civet kobuvirus sequence fell between feline and canine kobuviruses clades; and rodent isolates grouped with previously described mouse kobuviruses. However, the kobuviruses found in Vietnamese bats were divergent from previously found bat kobuviruses, but were closely related to the clade of rodent kobuviruses (Fig. 1) .
To better determine the zoonotic origin and the crossspecies transmission of kobuviruses, we applied a discrete trait model with BSSVS on MCMC time-scaled phylogenies. The estimated origin time of the entire Kobuvirus genus is over 1,000 years but with considerable uncertainty (mean ¼ 1,091 years; 95% highest posterior density (HPD): 587-1,704 years) (Fig. 1) . Three major clades can be seen in the simplified kobuvirus phylogeny ( Fig. 1 ). One major clade (AiV-A), which is the largest species with a wider host range than other kobuvirus species was composed of kobuviruses found in humans (AiV-A1), canines (AiV-A2), sewage (AiV-A3), felines (AiV-A4), birds (AiV-A5), and rats (AiV-A6). The TMRCA of AiV-A was estimated as 200 years ago, but again with considerable uncertainty (mean ¼ 198 years; 95% HPD: 112-750 years), with carnivora as the most likely ancestor host order (host posterior probability ¼ 0.59). The second clade was comprised of AiV-B, C, and D, with the majority of kobuviruses from artiodactyla (swine, bovine, and ovine) and 1 sequence (KF006985) from ferrets (Smits et al. 2013) . The recently discovered kobuviruses from rabbits (AiV-E) and bats (AiV-F and unassigned kobuviruses), were distinct from the two main clades.
We identified several statistically supported (Bayes Factor ! 5) transmission events between different host taxa during the evolution of kobuviruses (Fig. 1 ). There was a very strongly supported host jump from artiodactyla (sheep) to carnivora (ferret) with BF ¼ 62. There was also a strongly supported jump from bats to rabbits with BF ¼ 20. We additionally detected cross-species transmission between bats and rodents, but with only moderate support for either direction (BF ¼ 8 from rodents to bats; BF ¼ 5 from bats to rodents). We further observed that rodent kobuvirus clade and Vietnamese bat kobuvirus clade were the two clades that were the most closely related to human kobuvirus (AiV-A1) (Fig. 1) . However, the genetic distance between rodent/bat kobuvirus clades and AiV-A1 clade was substantial providing no direct evidence that AiV-A1 originated directly from rodents or bats. In addition, there were possible historical host jumps from carnivora to humans, and from carnivora to birds, but with weak support only (both with BF < 5).
We isolated 77 rodent-derived kobuvirus sequences from Vietnam, including 41 sequences from six murine species (including Bandicota indica, Rattus argentiventer, Rattus norvegicus, Rattus tanezumi, Rattus exulans, and Rattus losea) and 23 sequences from bamboo rats (Rhizomys pruinosus), which belong to the family Spalacidae. Kobuvirus VP1 sequences recovered from the six murine species exhibited a varied nucleotide sequence identity of 78-100%; Bamboo rat-derived kobuvirus sequences Bamboo rat-derived kobuvirus sequences were highly similar to each other (nucleotide sequence distances in the range of 0-2.9%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences fell into a rodent kobuvirus clade together with five previously reported kobuvirus sequences (Phan et al. 2011; Ng et al. 2012; Firth et al. 2014 ) with a TMRCA of 73 years (with 95%HPD 55-236 years) (Figs 1  and 2) . The entire rodent kobuvirus phylogeny could be grouped into four subclades. One subclade was composed of 41 murine Vietnamese sequences, the second subclade was composed of all bamboo rat sequences, 12 murine Vietnamese sequences, as well as three sequences isolated from brown rats (R. norvegicus) in USA (Firth et al., 2014) . A sewage-derived kobuvirus KoV-SewKTM (Ng et al. 2012 ) and a Vietnamese rat kobuvirus (KT944172) grouped together and formed a third subclade. One kobuvirus (JF755427), isolated from a wild Canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinitus, Cricetidae) in the USA (Phan et al. 2011) , was divergent from all the other sequences (Fig. 2) . These results confirmed that rodent-derived kobuviruses are present in multiple rodent families across wide geographic distances.
Our ancestral reconstruction also revealed extremely frequent transmissions of kobuviruses between the six species within the Muridae family ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Kobuviruses from B. indica may have been transmitted to four rodent species with mean transmission rate ¼ 0.02-0.06 exchanges year À1 and BF ¼ 9-85. Kobuviruses from R. argentiventer have been transmitted to two other rodent species with mean transmission rate ¼ 0.01 and 0.05 exchanges year À1 and BF ¼ 17 and 27, respectively. Kobuviruses from R. norvegicus have been transmitted to three other rodent species with mean transmission rate ¼ 0.01-0.02 exchanges year À1 and BF ¼ 5-6; transmissions in reverse direction were also supported (Supplementary Table S3 ). There was a notable host jump from Muridae to Spalacidae, with the specific species R. norvegicus acting as a donor for R. pruinosus, with mean transmission rate ¼ 0.01 and BF ¼ 5 (Figs 2 and 3) . These results indicate that rodent-derived kobuviruses may be transmitted frequently within the same rodent family, and may also transmit between different rodent families.
We isolated 38 partial kobuvirus genome sequences (length ¼ 523-6,859 nt) from bat faeces collected from bat roosts in Vietnam, which were closely related to rodent kobuviruses. Comparing the entire coding region (2, 164aa), a Vietnamese bat kobuvirus (MF947437) showed 87% aa identity to a Vietnamese rodent kobuvirus (MF947446) as well as to KoV-SewKTM. MF947437 also showed 74% aa identity to a mouse kobuvirus (JF755427), but only 40% aa identity to a known bat kobuvirus (KJ641686). Comparing the VP1 region only, the Vietnamese bat kobuvirus sequences shared 82-92% aa identity to rodent kobuviruses ( Supplementary Fig. S2) . The time-scaled phylogeny of VP1 regions showed that the clade of Vietnamese bat kobuviruses and the clade of rodent kobuviruses were close related with a TMRCA estimated at $100 years but with some uncertainty (mean 99 years, 95% HPD 55-164 years). Vietnamese bat sequences may have a more recent TMRCA with mean estimate of 43 years (95% HPD 10-78 years) (Fig. 1) . Further metagenomic investigations indicated that the bat faecal samples belonged to two bat species: Scotophilus kuhlii and Murina ussuriensis. These two bat species are within the family Vespertilionidae and are commonly found in Asia (Parker, Rambaut, and Pybus 2008) . Further ancestral reconstruction of Vietnamese bat kobuvirus VP1 sequences indicated possible cross-species transmission between the two species (with BF > 100), despite the limited sample size (Fig. 4) . In addition, we observed that the Vietnamese bat kobuvirus VP1 sequences were separated into two subclades. It is unclear whether the clustering of the two subclades was associated with bat species differentiation as the year. The tree being labelled with sequences accession numbers is in Supplementary Fig. S1. uneven samples from two bat species (37 samples from S. kuhlii n ¼ 37 and 1 sample from M. ussuriensis), and is also not related to geographic separation though the bat faecal samples, which were known to be collected from two districts (Cao Lanh and Chau Tang) in Dong Thap province (Supplementary Fig. S3 ).
The human kobuviruses (AiV-A1) were closely related to rodent kobuviruses and Vietnamese bat kobuviruses (Fig. 1) . Here, we obtained six human AiV-A1 sequences from Dong Thap province in Vietnam duriNg 2012-16. Four (MF947441, MF947407, MF947442, and MF947408) were identified in hospitalized young children (2 months to 2 years old) with diarrhoea, only one patients (where MF947442 were isolated from) had contact with animals (kept dogs and cats at home) in the record. Two (MF947409 and MF947410) were isolated from adult farm workers who had close contact with animals (including domestic pigs, chickens, ducks, dogs, and cats). None of them had contact with rodents and bats in the record. The estimated mean TMRCA of AiV-A1 overall (including three Genotypes A-C) was 73 years with 95% HPD¼ 41-218 years. Genotypes A and B have similar TMRCAs, originating in the early 1980 s (mean ¼ 35 years and 95% HPD ¼ 17-40 years for Genotype A; mean ¼ 33 years and 95% HPD ¼ 22-43 years for Genotype B). Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 gene sequences showed that the six AiV-A1 sequences found in our study all belonged to Genotype B with an estimated TMRCA around 2006. They were close related to other Genotype B sequences isolated from southeast China and South Korea in 2008 and 2010. Two AiV-A1 sequences (EU143279 and EU143278) have been previously detected in Dong Thap province in 2002 and 2003; they belong to Genotype A (Pham et al., 2008) . This result may indicate the current dominant AiV-A1 in Dong Thap province in Vietnam is Genotype B, the ancestor of which existed and spread in this area over a 10-year time frame ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ).
We identified one partial genome sequence of kobuvirus (MF947443) from a cat faecal sample in Dong Thap province. It had high nucleotide identity with other cat kobuviruses (90-93%). Asian palm civets (Paradoxurus hermaphrodites; Viverridae family) are farmed in Vietnam for the production of civet coffee (Deutsch and Murakhver 2012) . We isolated a kobuvirus VP1 sequence (KT944174) from civet faecal samples taken at a civet farm in Dak Lak province. It represents the first reported kobuvirus in Asian palm civets. This civet kobuvirus sequence was comparable to canine and feline kobuviruses, with 70-77% nt identity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the civet sequence fell into the clade composed of kobuviruses isolated from carnivora, including cats (Felis catus), dogs (Canis lupus), and foxes (Vulpes vulpes), but it belonged to a separate sub-lineage from canine kobuviruses and feline kobuviruses (Figs 1 and 5 ). In addition, the phylogeny of kobuviruses found in carnivora (including Canidae, Felidae, and Viverridae families) matched the branching order of their host phylogeny (Cornelis et al. 2012) , consistent with no cross-species transmission events.
In a previous study, we described the genetic diversity and spatiotemporal transmission of porcine kobuviruses (AiV-C1) in Vietnam using the VP1 sequences isolated between February and April 2012. We identified three co-circulating subclades in domestic pigs in Dong Thap province (Lu et al. 2016 ). In the present study, we obtained seven VP1 gene sequences of AiV-C1 in Dong Thap province from March 2013 to October 2014: four sequences (MF947411, MF947412, MF947413, and MF947416) belong to Clade 1, two (MF947414 and MF947415) belong to Clades 2 and 1 sequence (MF947417) belongs to Clade 3, indicating the three sub-clades of AiV-C1 are continuously cocirculating in Vietnam (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). 
Kobuviruses have a broad host range and can be transmitted either by physical contact, or indirectly from an environment contaminated by faecal shedding (Reuter Reuter, Boros, and Pankovics 2011) . Therefore, it is plausible that kobuviruses can be transmitted between different host taxa. Phylogenetic analysis supported the possibility of historical transmission events between different host orders, including jumps between artiodactyla and carnivora, between rabbits and bats, and between rodents and bats.
The rodentia is the largest order of mammals, comprising about 43% of all mammalian species (Huchon et al. 2002) . Rodents are known to harbour pathogens that cause > 60 human diseases (Meerburg, Singleton, and Kijlstra 2009) , as well as viruses with unknown zoonotic potential (e.g. kobuviruses, rosaviruses). Pathogens from rodents can be transmitted to humans or other animals either directly, by handling animals during trapping or farming, or indirectly, by occupying areas inhabited by rodents (Meerburg, Singleton, and Kijlstra 2009) . In this study, although we found kobuviruses in both rodents and humans, they were phylogenetically distinct. We did not detect kobuviruses from people that had had close contact with rodents. We found that kobuviruses may transmit frequently between multiple wild rodent species in Vietnam. Notably, we found a high prevalence of kobuviruses (81%) in farmed bamboo rats, which likely originated from kobuviruses carried by wild rodents.
Similar to rodents, bats are one of the most diverse and widely distributed mammals. They are a natural reservoir for many important emerging infectious viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses, lyssaviruses, filoviruses, and mammalian paramyxovirus (Johara et al. 2001; Leroy et al., 2005; Calisher et al. 2006; Drexler et al. 2012a ). Batderived viruses can be transmitted to other host species via contamination of food with bat excreta, or direct exposure to bat blood or excreta, or infection via intermediate hosts (Quan et al. 2013) . Pathogens derived from other animals may also spill over into bats, as some bat species feed on small vertebrates such as rats and birds (Morrison 1983) . Therefore, there is a possibility of a bat-derived virus transmitting to rodents living in the same environment or vice versa. In this study, we described a rodentlike kobuvirus from bat specimens in Dong Thap province in Vietnam. However, direct evidence of virus spill over between rodents and bats is still lacking. Ancestral reconstruction analysis indicated that kobuviruses are more likely to jump from rodents to bats, although this result had only weak support. Given that the common ancestor of the two lineages existed >100 years ago, there could also be an unknown host of both lineages and the host jump event may have occurred somewhere a long time before. In addition, the Vietnamese bat kobuviruses found in our study were distinct from the species AiV-F and unassigned kobuviruses previously found in bats, indicating that bat-derived kobuviruses are quite diverse. In comparison, high genetic diversity has also been observed among bat-derived hepaciviruses, which raises the possibility that other hepaciviruses, including HCV, may have originated from bats (Kapoor et al. 2011b; Drexler et al. 2012b; Quan et al. 2013 ). However, for kobuvirus, although the clade of Vietnamese bat kobuviruses is adjacent to the clade of human kobuviruses, there is no clear evidence to show that AiV-A1 originated from bats. Further investigation and discovery of kobuvirus sequences over larger geographical scales and in other host species may help to clarify the evolutionary connections.
In conclusion, we have identified kobuviruses in animal and human samples originating from Vietnam during between 2012 and 2016. This is the first large-scale study investigating kobuviruses in human and animals. The sequences obtained in this study provide new information on the occurrence of these viruses in a wider range of hosts than previously known. Crossspecies transmission events are revealed at the host order, family and species levels. Further molecular and epidemiological studies are required to determine the relevance, distribution, and diversity of kobuviruses in larger geographic scales and over time.

Complexed antigen, in fact, is taken up with high efficiency thanks to Fc receptors borne by APC . Antibody/antigen ratio in the complexes proved to be a critical parameter in enhancing antigen presentation . Complexes in moderate antibody excess provided optimal T cell activation independently of the physical state of the complexes {precipitated by a second antibody or solubilized by complement) . Complexes in extreme antibody excess, on the contrary, did not yield T cell activation although taken up by APC efficiently. The effect of antibodies at extreme excess was observed with substimulatory dose of antigen (loss of potentiation) and with optimal dose of antigen (loss of stimulation). An excess of specific polyclonal antibodies hampers proteolytic degradation of antigen in vitro, supporting the view that a similar mechanism may operate within the APC that have internalized immune complexes in extreme antibody excess. The possibility that immune complex forming in extreme antibody excess may turn off the T cell response is proposed as a regulatory mechanism .","I gs , the effector molecules of the immune response produced by B lymphocytes, have long been known to act also as positive or negative regulatory elements of the antibody response at different levels (1, 2) . More recently, it has been demonstrated that antibodies complexed with soluble antigens interfere with the T cell response . Inhibitory effect has been reported in the cytochrome system (3, 4) , but enhanced T cell response has been observed when antibodies bound with antigen promote Fc receptor-mediated recognition by APC (5, 6) . Complexed antibodies can also influence the fine specificity of the T cell response (7, 8) , possibly by modulating the processing pattern of antigen internalized by APC in complexed form (9, 10) and the subsequent spectrum ofpeptides that are made available for MHC binding and presentation to T cells. These mechanisms affect the selection of the T repertoire and offer a linkage between the previous experience of the immune system and the current response .
Most of the previous observations were made with mAbs. Since the in vivo antibody response to protein antigens is highly polyclonal (11) , we tested the regulatory effect of polyclonal complexes on the T cell response in a murine and in a human system . In both cases, antigen/antibody ratio ofthe complexes proved a critical parameter in dictating either enhancement or inhibition of T cell response. Antigen/antibody ratio in complexes forming in vivo may vary depending Volume 173 January 1991 37-48 on time and on anatomical site, and therefore, it may play a regulatory on the T cell response.
Antigens and Media . Lyophilized Escherichia coli a-galactosidase (GZ)' was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp ., Freehold, NJ (sp act, 85,000 EU/mg) . 1 enzyme unit (EU) is defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates 10 -9 mol o-nitro-phenyl (ONP) from ONP-D-galactoside (ONPG) in 1 min in conditions of substrate excess . Calculations of EU were made assuming a molar extinction of ONP corresponding to 4,700 at pH 9 (12) . Purified protein derivative (PPD ; Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark) and tetanus toxoid (TT Massachusetts Public Health Laboratories, Boston, MA) were used to generate human antigen-specific T lines. RMPI 1640 (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 P.g/ml streptomycin, 10 mM glutamine, 5 x 10 -s M 2-ME, and enriched with 10% FCS (Sterile Systems, Inc., Logan, UT) or with 5% autologous human plasma was used with murine cells or with human cells. Murine and Human T Cell Lines and Clones. GZ-specific murine T lines were generated according to the protocol originally described by Kimoto and Fathman (13) , with minor modifications IL2 Production by Murine T Hybridoma Cells and Prolferative Response ofHuman T Cells. Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were used as APC for T hybridomas . Peritoneal exudate was induced with one intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml Thioglycollate broth (Difco Laboratories Inc., Detroit, MI). The peritoneal cavity was washed 4 d later with 8 ml ice-cold complete RPMI 1640 without serum. The cells were washed twice, resuspended in complete medium, and counted after staining with crystal violet . Lymphocytes, accounting for 20-30% of the cells, were not considered . Antigen and antibodies (20,ul each) were dispensed in flat-bottomed microtiter plates and preincubated for 2 h at room temperature . Antiserum was diluted in heat-inactivated normal rabbit serum and affinitypurified antibodies in normal rabbit gammaglobulins. PEC (5 x   38 Processing of Complexed Antigen 10') and T hybridoma cells (2 x 104) were added to a final volume of 200 ul. After 24 h, the supernatants were harvested and tested for 11,2 production on the IIr2-dependent line CTLL as described (16) , the amount of supernatant being 25 ttl at afinaldilution of 1:4 . Inhibition experiments were performed with mAb 2AG2, kindly donated by Dr . J. Unkeless, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, specific for mouse FcR. Macrophages were pretreated for 1 h at 37°C with the anti-FcR mAb, or with heat-aggregated rabbit gamma globulins (HAGG; 62°C for 10 min) before addition of T cells and immune complexes.
Proliferative response by human T clones was measured by culturing 2 x 104 T cells plus 105 autologous irradiated PBL in 200 /Al medium in flat-bottomed microtiter plates . After 30 h, the wells were pulsed with 0.5 p,Ci ['H]TdR (5 Ci/mmol; Amersham International, Amersham, UK) and harvested 12 h later. Complexes were prepared in the culture wells with antigen and antibody at 10-fold dilutions in 20 I1 volume. 2 h later, cells in 200,ul were added. Final antigen concentration and antibody concentration are shown in Results.
Effect of Complement on Potentiation . Lyophilized rabbit complement (Behringwerke) and guinea pig complement (Sclavo, Siena, Italy) were reconstituted with distilled water and sterile filtered . Human complement was fresh human serum stored in aliquots at -80°C from donor F.M . tested for lack of toxicity on mouse cells. Complement (20 P1) was added to complexed antigen and incubated at 37°C for an additional hour. PEC and T cells were added and cultured as described above.
Digestion of GZ with Proteolytic Enzymes. GZ was preincubated with affinity-purified antibodies overnight at room temperature. The pH was brought to 5 with acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4), and pepsin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added as described in detail in the figure legends. Digestion with cathepsin D (Sigma Chemical Co.) was performed at pH 6 under similar conditions. Digestion with V8 protease (Sigma Chemical Co.) was performed in Tris-HCI buffer (0 .5 M, pH 8) . After incubation at 37°C for different time intervals, samples were neutralized with Tris buffer (1 M pH 8) and tested for residual enzymatic activity or analyzed for cleavage of the GZ monomer by SDS gel electrophoresis. SDS Gel Electrophoresis. GZ was radioiodinated with the Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham International) after the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Specific radioactivity of the sample was 3.4 x 105/cpm per hg protein. Gel electrophoresis was performed in a mini gel apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and the gels were dried and autoradiographed on Hyperfilm (Amersham International) .
Potentiating Activity ofPolyclonal Antibodies. The effect of complexing antigen with specific polyclonal antibodies on presentation by macrophages to a specific T hybridoma clone is illustrating in Fig. 1 . Exposing T cells to antigen alone results in detectable stimulation only when antigen concentration is >3 Ag/ml (Fig. 1 a) . In contrast, in the presence of rabbit anti-GZ (RaGZ) polyclonal antibodies at 1 :250 and 1 :50 dilution, antigen concentration of 0.3 htg/ml is stimulatory (b and c) . Higher antibody concentration inhibits potentiation (d) and also prevents presentation of a stimulatory dose of antigen (e) . When appropriate complexes are used (1 :50 RaGZ, 1 Ftg/ml GZ ; (c), the peak production of IL-2 is higher than in the presence of optimal concentration of free antigen at 10 Ag/ml. This suggested that we explore more accurately the effect of antigen/antibody ratio in the system . Effect ofAntigen/Antibody Rutia GZ was mixed with increasing concentrations of RaGZ. The precipitation curve (Fig.  2 , solid line) was determined, and the macrophage-mediated stimulatory effect of the various complexes on T cells was evaluated as shown in Fig. 2 a. The dashed line indicates IL-2 production by T cells in the presence of immune complexes at the same ratios as used for the precipitation experiment . Similar curves were obtained with three additional T hybridoma clones (data not shown) . In all cases, optimal stimulation was obtained with complexes in moderate antibody 39 Manca et al. To eliminate any potential interference of serum proteins other than antibodies, the experiment was repeated with affinity-purified antibodies. Fig. 2 b confirms that in this case also, complexes with extreme antibody excess are no longer effective for potentiation, and that potentiation occurs with complexes at optimal ratio (equivalence or moderate excess) . Figure 3 . T cells respond to antigen complexed at optimal ratio at a 2-log lower dose than antigen alone. Complexes corresponding to optimal ratio (solid circles) and to extreme antibody excess (open circles) in Fig . 2 were prepared with GZ and with RaGZ . After incubation for 1 h, the complexes were serially diluted and tested for capacity to induce T cell activation. Final concentration of complexed or free antigen (squares) is on the abscissa. As little as 0 .015 t~g/ml GZ induces a detectable stimulation of T cells . GZ at stimulatory concentration when in free form (8 tug/ml) no longer stimulates when complexed in extreme antibody excess . Fig. 3 shows a titration curve ofcomplexes at different ratios. Complexes were prepared by mixing the reactants and were diluted after incubation . As little as 15 ng/ml antigen can be detected in complexes with optimal ratio. In contrast, complexes with excess antibodies were nonstimulatory even when final antigen concentration was stimulatory by itself. This indicates that antibody excess blocks potentiation in the first case and inhibits presentation in the second case.
Antigen . We tested whether the lack of T cell stimulation Table 1 
RaGZ at various dilutions and GZ (1 tug/ml) were preincubated with APC for 4 h at 37°C . Normal rabbit serum (NRS) or RaGZ (20 tul) were added, and 4 h later, T cells were dispensed in the wells . IL-2 production in the supernatants was measured on CTLL cells, and results are given as thymidine incorporation by the indicator line (± SD) .
Processing of Complexed Antigen (squares) or optimal complexes corresponding to 03 tug/ml GZ final concentration (circles) was added to APC along with T cells. IIT2 production is shown on the ordinate, as thymidine incorporation by the Ilr2-dependent line CTLL . (c) PEC were preincubated with transferrin-antitransferrin complexes at various ratios, the final concentration of transferrin being 10 tug/ml. Precipitation curve of the irrelevant transferrin-antitransferrin complexes is represented by the dashed line, with residual radioactive antigen in the supernatants shown on the left ordinate. Free antigen at 10 tug/ml final concentration (squares) or optimal complexes (circles) containing RaGZ and antigen to give a 0 .3 tug/ml final concentration were added to APC along with responding T cells . IIT2 production, measured as the proliferative response of the CTLL cells on the right ordinate, indicates T cell activation.
in the presence of extreme antibody excess was due to a direct inhibitory effect of free antibody on antigen presentation. For this purpose, APC were pulsed with GZ complexes at optimal ratio. After washing, immune rabbit serum was added to the pulsed APC at the concentration corresponding to antibody excess, along with responding T cells. As shown in Table 1 , large antibody excess has no effect on T cell activation when APC had been pulsed with complexes at optimal antigen/antibody ratio. Therefore, the effect is due nei- ther to toxicity for APC nor to masking of processed antigen by free antibody in excess . Role ofFc Receptors in the Mechanisms of Potentiation. To confirm that potentiation is due to uptake of complexed antigen by APC via FcR in the case of polyclonal antibodies, as previously demonstrated with mAbs (8), we used anti-FcR mAbs or HAGG to functionally block FcR on APC . Fig . 4 a and b) is not affected by either reagent, indicating that only uptake of complexed antigen is FcR dependent . Furthermore, immune complexes of transferrin and antitransferrin at different ratios were also tested . Fig. 4 c shows that complexes in antibody excess inhibit T cell activation induced by a suboptimal dose of antigen complexed with specific antibodies at optimal ratio for potentiation, but T cell activation induced by an optimal dose of free GZ is not affected. This is consistent with the concept that potentiation depends on availability of FcR and that complexes in large antibody excess do not ""engulf"" the APC. Role ofComplement Receptors in the Mechanism ofPotentiation. Since FcRpositive APC also bear complement receptors, we tested whether complement activation by immune complexes could further facilitate uptake and presentation. Addition of rabbit, guinea pig, or human complement to immune complexes provides additional potentiation at low doses of antigen (Fig. 5) .
Macrophages Are`Armed"" Neither by Polyclonal nor by Monoclonal Free Antibodies, but Retain Aggregated Antibodies on the Surface for a Short Period. We tested whether APC can be armed by polyclonal antibodies thanks to binding of free antibodies to FcR . Fig. 6 a shows that preincubation of APC with uncomplexed specific antibodies does not facilitate antigen presentation to T cells . This is somehow expected with polyclonals, since in addition to low affinity of FcR for free antibody, competition for receptor binding may occur between the large fraction of nonspecific Igs and the small fraction of specific antibodies. When the experiment was performed with mAb D6C9 in ascitic form (17) , in which most of the antibody molecules are GZ specific, no functional arming of APC was detectable (Fig. 6 a) . mAb D6C9 was selected from a panel of available monoclonals because, in combination with T hybridoma clone 1.7.1, it behaves as polyclonal b ""~ Eel RaGZ serum (circles), or with 100 AI mAb D6C9 (described in reference 17) at 1 mg/ml prepared from an ascitic fluid precipitated with ammonium sulfate (triangles) . PEC were washed twice after incubation and plated for the assay under normal conditions . GZ was added in 20 Eel volume as free antigen (final concentration on the abscissa) . T cell activation, measured as IIL2-induced proliferative response of CTLL cells, is on the ordinate . (b) Heat-aggregated (62°C, 10 min) DEAF-purified IgG fraction from RaGZ at 1 mg/ml final concentration was preincubated with PEC as above. After washing, PEC were cultured with T cells.
Antigen at a substimulatory dose (0 .3 Erg/ml) or at an optimal dose (10 Erg/ml) was added at the different times shown on the abscissa . T cell activation as 11,2 production measured on CTLL cells is shown on the min ordinate. 30 90 rabbit antibodies, in that potentiation is lost when used in extreme excess (40:1 nominal ratio), as described previously (8) . Fig. 6 b shows that APC preincubated with polyclonal antibodies in aggregated form can present a substimulatory dose of antigen to T cells, provided antigen is given within 10 min after pulsing. On the other hand, APC can present a stimulatory dose of antigen at any time after pulsing with aggregated antibodies. This suggests that aggregated antibodies bound to the cell surface are retained for a short period and are likely internalized afterwards .
Adherent Peritoneal Macrophages Are Responsible forPotentiation. Peritoneal exudates contain several cell types capable of antigen presentation, namely, macrophages, dendritic cells, and B lymphocytes. Antibody-potentiated presentation is FcR dependent, therefore, dendritic cells that are FcR negative cannot be involved in this phenomenon . To discriminate between macrophages and B cells, peritoneal exudate cells were separated between adherent and nonadherent populations. Potentiating capacity was retained intact by adherent macrophages, whereas the nonadherent fraction containing the B cells had negligible capacity to present complexed antigen ( Table 2 ). This was confirmed by using spleen cells that contain a large fraction of B lymphocytes, depleted of adherent macrophages ( Table 2 ). It should be noted that presenting function of optimal concentration of antigen was exerted also by the nonadherent fraction.
Clearance ofComplexed Antigen by APC as a Measure ofAntigen Uptake. Since antigen uptake is a dynamic process associated with release of degraded antigen fragments (18) , actual accumulation of antigen in APC is difficult to evaluate. Therefore, we assumed that removal of intact antigen from culture supernatants, depending on the presence ofAPC and Table 2 . Adherent Peritoneal Macrophages Are Responsible for Potentiated Presentation of Complexed Antigen PEC and spleen cells were plated at 5 x 103 and 50 x 104/well, respectively. After a 6-h incubation at 37°C, nonadherent cells were gently resuspended and transferred to new wells . Medium was added to the wells containing the adherent cells . T cells and antigen (10 Pg/ml free GZ or 0.3 ttg/ml GZ complexed with affinity-purified antibodies at optimal ratio) were added to the presenting cells, and the assay for IL-2 production was performed as described . Results are shown as cpm x 10 -3 thymidine incorporation by the IL-2-dependent line CTLL. 42 Processing of Complexed Antigen of specific antibodies, is a measure of uptake of complexed antigen .
Complexes were prepared by mixing 1 jig/ml GZ with an equal volume of RaGZ at various dilutions, as indicated in Fig. 7 . After incubation, the complexes were added to 106 PEC in 24-well plates (Costar) in 1 ml medium to a final concentration of 0.1 p,g/ml GZ. After 5 h, the supernatants were harvested and residual intact antigen was measured as enzyme activity. No loss in enzymatic activity was seen upon incubation of free antigen in wells with or without PEC. No loss in enzymatic activity was seen in wells containing complexed antigen without APC . Fig. 7 shows the results expressed as percent difference of enzyme activity between input antigen and residual antigen after incubation, defined as antigen uptake . Uptake was evident when complexes had been prepared with RaGZ at a 1:40 or higher concentration .
Therefore, complexes at extreme antibody excess (right end of the curve) are cleared from the culture supernatant, suggesting that extreme antibody excess does not prevent effective uptake, in contrast with reduced effectiveness when the same complexes are used to stimulate antigen-specific T cells, as shown in Fig. 2 . 21 17 Nonadherent PEC 16 3 Spleen cells 26 21 Adherent spleen cells 20 25 Nonadherent spleen cells 20 2 (14) 35 (5) V8 protease 100 (30) 100 (1) 55 (0) GZ was complexed with affinity-purified antibodies at different concentrations, corresponding to complexes in extreme antibody excess, equivalence, and antibody defect (see precipitation curve shown in Fig . 2 b) . Digestion with proteolytic enzymes was carried out for 30 min . Results are shown as percent residual enzymatic activity, assuming 100% as the input activity. Residual enzymatic activity of samples containing GZ and nonspecific rabbit gamma globulins at the same concentrations (nonprotected controls) is shown in parentheses .
Proteolytic Degradation of Complexed Antigen . Extreme antibody excess neither inhibits antigen presentation (Table 1) nor blocks removal of complexed antigen by APC taken as a measure of antigen uptake (Fig. 7) . Therefore, we tested whether extreme antibody excess hampers proteolysis of antigen. Complexes were constructed with affinity-purified antibody excess at neutral pH and digested with pepsin at pH 5, with cathepsin D at pH 6, and with V8 protease at pH 8 . Acidic pH allows proteolytic activity of pepsin and cathepsin D, but does not interfere with antigen-antibody interactions, as tested with an ELISA (data not shown). At various time intervals, samples from the reaction mixtures were collected and neutralized to block proteolytic activity of pepsin and (Left panels) Complexes were prepared by using equal volumes of antigen at 1 tog/ml and RaGZ at various dilutions as indicated on the abscissa . One volume heat-inactivated normal rabbit serum (1 :100) was added to the complexes . Precipitation in c was obtained by adding one volume goat anti-rabbit gamma globulin serum 1 :4 for an additional 2 h . Precipitation of the the complexes was evaluated as residual antigen in the supernatants (EU on the left ordinate) after centrifugation. In the presence of goat anti-rabbit gamma globulin, serum also soluble complexes in extreme antibody excess precipitate . (Right panels) Complexes containing the second antibody were also tested for T cell activation by adding 40 Ftl of the mixture to cultures . Final GZ concentration was 0 .1 Rg/ml . The T cell stimulating capacity of the complexes (b) and of the complexes precipitated by the second antibody (d) is shown . IIT2-induced proliferative response of CTLL cells as a measure of T cell activation is on the right ordinate. cathepsin D, or mixed with an equal volume of normal rabbit serum to block V8 protease activity. Neutralization also restores enzymatic capacity of GZ. Table 3 demonstrates that proteolytic activity of pepsin, cathepsin, and V8 protease measured as loss of catalytic activity of GZ is greatly inhibited when antigen is complexed with specific antibodies in large excess, as compared with control samples containing normal rabbit gamma globulins.
Radioiodinated GZ was complexed with antibodies in excess or mixed with normal gamma globulins. Digestion with proteolytic enzymes was performed as described. Complexing with affinity-purified antibodies protects GZ from degradation by proteolytic enzymes effective at different pH (Fig.  8) . In particular, digestion by cathepsin D, one of the endosomal enzymes involved in antigen processing, is completely prevented by antibodies . It should also be noted that digestion with V8 protease yields low molecular mass fragments (<14 kD) that are retained in the gel. In contrast, when proteolysis is performed with pepsin or cathepsin, no low mo- Figure 10 . Complement-dependent solubilization does not prevent activity of potentiating complexes . (Left panels) Precipitation of complexes tested as residual enzymatic activity of supernatants after centrifugation on the left ordinate was inhibited by adding fresh rabbit serum as a source of complement (a vs. c) . (Right panels) T cells stimulation (IL2-dependent proliferation of CTLL cells on the right ordinate) by complexes or by complement solubilized complexes (b and d) is optimal with complexes in moderate antibody excess, even in the absence of precipitation . Final antigen concentration was 0 .1 gg/ml. lecular weight fragments are retained in the gel matrix after TCA fixation.
Precipitation ofComplexed Antigen Does Not Accountfor Potentiation. To test whether potentiation is due to antibodyinduced antigen precipitation and consequent concentration of antigen in proximity of APC, we set up two different experiments. In the first one, all complexes were precipitated with goat anti-rabbit gamma globulin, irrespective of their ratios. Fig. 9 shows that soluble complexes in antibody excess are precipitated, as well as complexes at equivalence (a vs. c). Nevertheless, complexes in extreme antibody excess are ineffective for T cell stimulation, even though precipitated by the second antibody (b vs. ti) . Furthermore, only complexes prepared with moderate antibody excess are stimulatory. In the second experiment, precipitation of complexes was prevented by using complement to solubilize immune complexes (19) . Fig. 10 shows that in the presence of fresh rabbit serum as a source of complement, precipitable complexes do not form at any antibody-antigen ratio (a vs. c). Complexes are effective for T cell activation when antibody is at optimal ratio even in the absence of precipitation, and extreme antibody excess yields ineffective complexes even in 44 Processing of Complexed Antigen on T cell activation in a different system, we used TT and a TTspecific human T clone. Antigen was given to T cells at a substimulatory dose (0.01 jig/ml, as defined by titration curve in Fig . 11 a) complexed with antibodies. Complexes were prepared at various ratios as shown in the precipitation curve (Fig. 11 b) . Fig. 11 c shows that optimal T cell stimulation occurs with complexes at optimal ratio, corresponding to moderate antibody excess. Complexes at equivalence are not as effective, and complexes at extreme antibody excess do not yield T cells stimulation . Fig. 11 c also shows that nonstimulatory complexes, or antiTT antibodies alone, have no inhibitory effect on a PPD-specific clone stimulated with the relevant antigen .
The capacity of bound Igs to facilitate uptake of corpuscular antigens by phagocytic cells has long been known as opsonization (20) . More recently, the capacity of Igs to enhance uptake of soluble antigens by macrophages, that in turn present processed antigen to specific T cells, has been described as enhancement or potentiation (5) . Therefore, antibodies facilitate recognition of minute amounts of antigen that cannot be taken up effectively by accessory cells . In this regard, macrophages as accessory cells strikingly differ from antigenspecific B cells that make use of surface Igs to focus on antigen while exerting their accessory function (21, 22) .
The potentiating activity has been described with polyclonal antibodies (5) , and subsequently with mAbs (6) (7) (8) . The mechanisms and the implications of receptor-mediated antigen uptake on presentation to T cells has been recently reviewed (23) .
We explored the effect of antigen/antibody ratio in complexes as a variable that possibly influences uptake, processing, and presentation of antigen . When complexes constructed at different ratios were given to macrophages, T cell activation only occurred with complexes in a limited range of antigen/antibody ratios. In particular, complexes in extreme antibody excess were poor stimulators for T cells, whereas complexes close to equivalence, as defined by precipitation curves, provided optimal potentiation . Extreme antibody excess does not only abrogate the potentiating effect of complexed antibodies for subliminal dose of antigen, but it also prevents effective presentation ofantigen at optimal stimulatory dose.
A possible influence of antigen/antibody ratio on complex uptake was tested. By measuring the clearance ofcomplexed antigen in the presence of APC, evidence was obtained that extreme antibody excess does not inhibit uptake.
Complexes endowed with optimal potentiating capacity are close to equivalence and are precipitable only in part by centrifugation . Therefore, antigen focusing in proximity of APC may account for potentiation. Nevertheless, the following arguments stand against such a possibility : (a) complexes at equivalence are not the most effective complexes for potentiation; (b) potentiation is mediated by FcR (Fig. 4) and not by simple antigen uptake by APC, as shown in the inhibition experiments with anti-FcR mAbs, with HAGG, and with unrelated immune complexes ; (c) precipitation ofcom-plexes used for experiments is detected only after centrifugation, and at 1 g, as in the culture wells, sedimentation of complexes is negligible during incubation with cells (data not shown) ; (d) antibody excess complexes that precipitate in part and do not potentiate acquire no stimulatory capacity upon precipitation with a second antibody (Fig. 10 d) ; (e) optimal complexes at moderate antibody excess retain potentiating capacity when solubilized with complement (Figs . 5 and 11) . Similar results were obtained when affinity-purified antibodies were used for the preparation of the complexes, indicating that serum proteins other than antibodies are not responsible for the effects described . The complexes used in the experiments at different ratios were defined according to precipitation curves (equivalence, moderate, and extreme antibody excess) . Complexes at equivalence can be characterized for actual antibody/antigen ratio since all available antigen and antibody molecules are present in the precipitate . Such a molar ratio was close to 10 in GZ-containing complexes (data not shown) . In contrast, complexes that partially precipitate (moderate antibody excess) or do not precipitate (extreme antibody excess) cannot be accurately defined for actual molar ratio, but only for nominal ratio of the reactants in the mixture .
The diversity of Fc receptors on APC (reviewed in references 24 and 25) should be considered in this discussion . FcRI is a 70-kD glycoprotein with high affinity for monomeric IgG (26) . Nevertheless, binding ofmonomeric polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies by APC was not evident when tested in a functional assay in which antigen was given immediately after pulsing with monomeric antibodies and T cell activation was used to measure antigen presentation (Fig. 6 ). In particular, mAb D6C9, used for this experiment was previously reported to behave similarly to polyclonal antibodies, in that large excess in the complexes prevents activation of T clone 1.7.1 (8) . This effect of mAb D6C9 was not evident with other T clones, suggesting that in the presence of this mAb processing of antigen is influenced in such a way that only the epitope recognized by clone 1.7.1 was not effectively presented. In this respect, interference by an excess ofmonoclonal and polyclonal antibodies may differ. mAbs may affect appropriate processing of one limited region of the antigen, as described in the myoglobin system (7), whereas polyclonal antibodies may interfere with the overall degradation of the antigen molecule. FcRII, a 40-kB glycoprotein, has low affinity for monomeric IgG, and is more specific for complexed Igs. FcRII is recognized by mAb 2AG2 (27) , which inhibits potentiation almost completely. Therefore, FcRII is a candidate to be the most relevant receptor for potentiation . Murine FcRIII is poorly characterized and does not seem to participate effectively in potentiation when FcRII is blocked by monoclonal 2AG2.
Antibody excess is not detrimental during the step of antigen presentation (Table 1 ). This suggests that free antibody does not interfere with surface expression of processed antigen by APC preventing its interaction with the specific T cell.
The experiments show that extreme antibody excess prevents enzymatic degradation of antigen hidden in the core of the complex (Fig. 8) , possibly by sterically hindering the contact between antigen and proteolytic enzyme(s) . The experiment was carried out with pepsin at pH 5, which is similar to or lower than the pH in the acidic compartments where processing is likely to occur (28) ; with cathepsin D, a representative endosomal enzyme (29) at pH 6; and with V8 protease, a proteolytic enzyme commonly used for protein fingerprinting, at pH 8. mAbs protect antigens from proteolysis (30) , and in particular, some well-defined regions in spacial proximity to the relevant epitope (31) (32) (33) . Interferences of antibodies with intracellular degradation of TT taken up by monoclonal antigen-specific lymphoblastoid lines confirms that mAbs can modulate antigen processing (9), as we previously proposed (8) . In particular, monoclonal B lymphoblastoid cells with different fine specificities for TT generate different degradation products upon uptake and internalization ofantigen mediated by the surface Ig receptor (10) . It is likely that in the case of polyclonal antibodies, which bind to different epitopes on the antigen molecule, this protective mechanism is even more efficient .
Therefore, potentiation of antigen presentation may result from a balance between moderate antibody excess, which facilitates uptake of complexed antigen without blocking degradation, and extreme antibody excess, which shields the antigen molecule from processing by the APC . Furthermore, when complexes in large antibody excess are presented to APC, many FcR are engaged to internalize immune complexes that contain a low amount of antigen relative to the number of Ig molecules, suggesting the functional concept of much work for a poor catch. The interference of unrelated immune complexes (transferrin-antitransferrin) in large antibody excess with FcR-mediated potentiation, but not with presentation of an optimal dose of free antigen, indicates that lack of stimulation by antibody excess complexes is not due to nonspecific functional engulfment of APC . Potentiation in the system we describe is chiefly mediated by adherent macrophages, the major cellular component of peritoneal exudate . Nonadherent cells in the exudate capable of antigen presentation, i.e., B cells and dendritic cells, were unable to present low doses of complexed antigen . This is expected with FcR-negative dendritic cells, and the failure of FcRpositive B cells to bring about potentiation is in agreement with the observation that human B cells cannot present TT in complexed form to spe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since complexes also form in vivo, activated and bound complement factors may further enhance uptake by APC by binding to complement receptors. An enhancing effect was seen in vitro, suggesting that complement receptors also participate in potentiation of antigen uptake . Enhanced phagocytosis mediated by receptors for complement (35) and enhanced degradation of Ig aggregates by macrophages in the presence of complement (36, 37) have been described, but a role for complement receptors on APC has not been related so far to potentiation of antigen presentation to T cells.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The effect of antigen /antibody ratio on potentiation was also examined with human T cells and human polyclonal antibodies. When complexes are constructed at extreme antibody excess, potentiating capacity is lost. Also, in this case, the effect cannot be attributed to engulfment of APC by antibody excess complexes, since presentation of an unrelated antigen such as PPD to PPD-specific T cells was not impaired. Therefore, potentiation by complexes at the appropriate ratio appears to be a more general phenomenon in different species and in different antigenic systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potentiation may also be a relevant in vivo event with distinct functions . Complement is available in vivo and its activation by complexes may further facilitate uptake by accessory cells . Precipitation ofcomplexes is less likely to take place in vivo where complement exerts its solubilizing activity (19) . Antigen/antibody ratio may change at different times and in different compartments . Therefore, complexed antigen may appear in a stimulatory or a nonstimulatory form. These events may participate in the regulation of the T cell response. In particular, when boosting antigen meets with residual antibodies during a secondary response, complexes that form facilitate uptake of nonstimulatory doses of antigen by APC resulting in T cell activation. T cell clonal expansion ensues and further increases the chances for a specific T cell to encounter a specific B cell (38) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When secreted antibodies reach a concentration that largely overcomes antigen concentration, complexes in antibody excess form. One can speculate that this leads to withering of T and B responses. In fact, if antigen is complexed with excess antibodies, there are no epitopes available for binding to surface Igs on specific B cells . Specific B cells cannot take up, process, and present the antigen to specific T cells and gain help in turn for antibody production . In addition, even though antigen is taken up as a complex by APC, antibody excess hinders its appropriate degradation and processed antigen is no longer available," with a consequent fading of the T cell response as well.""","Effect of antigen/antibody ratio on macrophage uptake, processing, and presentation to T cells of antigen complexed with polyclonal antibodies",,J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2118742/,200,5580,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,a2c2196aecd2142d5881124b7cd8ff252581c784,"Pulmonary infection is a common complication after lung transplantation, and early detection is crucial for outcome. However, the condition can be clinically difficult to diagnose and to distinguish from rejection. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate heparin-binding protein (HBP), lysozyme, and the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as potential biomarkers for pulmonary infection in lung-transplanted patients. One hundred thirteen BALF samples from 29 lung transplant recipients were collected at routine scheduled bronchoscopies at 3 and 6 months, or on clinical indication. Samples were classified into no, possible, probable, or definite infection at the time of sampling. Rejection was defined by biopsy results. HBP, lysozyme, and cytokines were analyzed in BALF and correlated to likelihood of infection and rejection. All biomarkers were significantly increased in BALF during infection, whereas patients with rejection presented low levels that were comparable to noninfection samples. HBP, IL-1β, and IL-8 were the best diagnostic markers of infection with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values of 0.88, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively. In conclusion, HBP, IL-1β, and IL-8 could be useful diagnostic markers of pulmonary infection in lung-transplanted patients. K E Y W O R D S basic (laboratory) research/science, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), clinical research/practice, cytokines/cytokine receptors, infectious disease, lung disease: infectious, lung transplantation/ pulmonology, rejection","can therefore be difficult to distinguish clinically. However, Lntx patients may lack classical signs of infection due to heavy immunosuppression, and rejection may be asymptomatic. In addition, there are possible links between infection and the development of rejection. 4 For example, viral pneumonia has been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and graft loss. 5 Antimicrobial peptides in respiratory secretions play an important role as a first line of defence against infections. 7 Lysozyme is the most abundant airway antimicrobial peptide, and is secreted primarily by neutrophils and sub-mucosal glands. 8 Heparin-binding protein (HBP) was initially recognized for its broad antimicrobial activity, but is now known to be a multifunctional inflammatory mediator that induces vascular leakage and acts as a chemoattractant and activator of monocytes. 9, 10 The protein is stored in secretory and azurophilic granules of neutrophils, and is rapidly released upon cell activation. 11 Plasma HBP has been described as a promising biomarker for severe sepsis and septic shock, 12 and elevated HBP levels have also been shown in cerebrospinal fluid during bacterial meningitis 13 and in urine during urinary tract infections. 14 Neither HBP nor lysozyme has previously been evaluated in BALF of Lntx patients. In this study, we quantified the two proteins together with the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 in BALF collected during the first year after transplantation. The primary aim was to evaluate HBP and lysozyme as potential biomarkers for infection, and to determine their ability to discriminate infection from rejection in lung transplant recipients.
This prospective cohort study was conducted at Skåne University Hospital, one of two centers in Sweden that performs Lntx. Adult patients accepted for Lntx during the study period from October 2012 to December 2014 were eligible for inclusion. Patients younger than 18 years of age and patients with postoperative follow-up at other sites were excluded. All study participants were followed for a maximum of 1 year after transplantation. Written informed consent was obtained from all study patients. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee (Reg nr 433-08) and performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Standard protocol for immune suppression included induction therapy with ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin), followed by tacrolimus or cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. All Lntx recipients were treated with cytomegalovirus and fungal prophylaxis for 3-6 months.
BALF samples were collected at routine scheduled bronchoscopies at 3 and 6 months after Lntx or at diagnostic bronchoscopies performed in response to clinical symptoms. A minimal interval of 7 days was allowed between BALs to be included as a new sample in the study. BAL procedure followed a standardized protocol. Study samples for analyses of HBP, lysozyme, and cytokines were obtained after installation of 20 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), where the initial 10 mL of BALF was discharged after which a study sample of 10 mL was collected. Portions of 20 mL of PBS were then instilled to collect BALF according to a standard protocol for bacterial, fungal, and cytological analyses. BALF was sent to the Skåne University TBBs was semi-quantitatively reported as no, mild, or acute/abundant inflammation.
The likelihood of pulmonary infection at the time of BALF sampling was independently, and blinded to the results of the biomarkers, 
To adjust for dilution of BALF in estimating the biomarker concen- 
Chi-square, rank sum, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U tests were Using logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for infection (dichotomized into definite and probable vs no or possible infection and rejection) for each biomarker. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to account for the possibility of dependency due to multiple observations from the same patient.
The different biomarkers were first analyzed in univariable models and secondly in models adjusted for time after Lntx. All statistical tests were two-sided, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) that 
In total, 39 patients were transplanted during the study period. Five patients were not eligible for inclusion due to follow-up at another center, and one patient declined participation. Consequently, 33 patients were included in the study. Four participants died shortly after transplantation, before any study samples were collected, leaving 29 lung transplant recipients prospectively followed in this study. The patients, 12 women and 17 men, had a median age of 56 years, 86% underwent double lung transplantation, and cystic fibrosis was the most common underlying disease. For details on patient characteristics, see Table 2 . 
Patients were assessed for infection at the time of BAL as described in Table 1 Bacterial growth was detected in 54 BALF samples (48%).
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated bacterial species (12%), followed by Escherichia coli (9% At an HBP cut-off value of 150 ng/mL, sensitivity was 75% and specificity was 92% for the detection of infection; positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 92% and 76%, respectively. IL-1β and IL-8 performed similar to HBP, whereas lysozyme showed poor sensitivity and specificity (Table 3) . 
In this prospective study on lung transplant recipients comparing different biomarkers for prediction of infection, we found that HBP, Similar to HBP and lysozyme, all cytokines increased with the likelihood of infection, mirroring increased inflammation. IL-10 has anti-inflammatory properties but showed the same pattern as the pro-inflammatory cytokines in this study. IL-10 is believed to play an important role in balancing the inflammatory response in order to limit host tissue damage. 19 For example, compared to wild-type mice, IL-10-deficient mice demonstrate more efficient bacterial clearance but higher mortality and increased neutrophil recruitment to the lung in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, 20 which underscores the regulatory role of IL-10 during infection. It could therefore be speculated that IL-10 increases simultaneously with pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to avoid excessive inflammation that would be harmful to the host.
To correct for dilution factors of BALF, we used the urea method as In this study, we found no significant differences in levels between rejection and noninfection for any of the biomarkers. Contrary to our results, Patella et al have demonstrated increased levels of IL-10 during rejection compared to no rejection. 22 One possible reason for this discrepancy is that rejection is defined differently in the two studies. Here, we identify rejection with TBB to ensure correct diagnosis. All tested biomarkers have in common that they indicate neutrophil-dominated inflammation. In contrast, rejection is primarily a T cell-driven process, 23 ","Heparin‐binding protein, lysozyme, and inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as diagnostic tools for pulmonary infection in lung transplanted patients","Stjärne Aspelund, Anna; Hammarström, Helena; Inghammar, Malin; Larsson, Hillevi; Hansson, Lennart; Christensson, Bertil; Påhlman, Lisa I.",Am J Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5813223/,223,1064,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,db71883643ea4dbc79a8f3e5248811d9c3385c3e,"Among the various nano/biomaterials used in cancer treatment, the beauty and benefits of DNA nanocomposites are outstanding. The specificity and programmability of the base pairing of DNA strands, together with their ability to conjugate with different types of functionalities have realized unsurpassed potential for the production of two-and threedimensional nano-sized structures in any shape, size, surface chemistry and functionality. This review aims to provide an insight into the diversity of static DNA nanodevices, including DNA origami, DNA polyhedra, DNA origami arrays and bioreactors, DNA nanoswitch, DNA nanoflower, hydrogel and dendrimer as young but promising platforms for cancer theranostics. The utility and potential of the individual formats in biomedical science and especially in cancer therapy will be discussed.","The integration of nanotechnology into other biomedical sciences has been a blessing for all researchers around the world. Various nanocarriers including polymeric nanoparticles such as hydrogeles, dendrimers, polymerosomes, lipid nanocarriers such as liposomes, micelles, organic nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and non-organic nanoparticulates of gold, silver, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 , etc. have often been used for various purposes in the detection and cure of human diseases, in particular, cancer. [1] [2] [3] Nevertheless, various physiological/physical barriers still need to be addressed in relation to: (i) tumor cell heterogeneity such as clonal evolution and alteration/loss of tumor cell-specific surface markers, (ii) microenvironment of cancer cell such as the presence of a dense extracellular matrix, poor vascular system, low pH, etc., (iii) presence of different physiological barriers such as plasma/nuclear/organelle membranes, blood-brain barrier (BBB), etc; (iv) properties of nanoparticles, including their safety profile, stability, drug encapsulation efficiency, etc. 4, 5 These barriers have all directed experiments towards the production of the ideal nanoparticle capable of sensing, adapting and reacting to the surrounding microenvironment.
Formulation of such an intelligent and adaptable nanodevice requires a high degree of programmability, a potential, which is hopefully presented by Watson-Crick base pairing principle defined for nucleic acid hybridization. In the first steps of imagining such a fantasy, Seeman used branched DNA with sticky ends to prepare and introduce the first two-dimensional (2D) DNA crystal structure in 2003. 6 One year later, Turberfield et al, attempted the one-stage selfassembly of the first DNA cage (DNA tetrahedra) as a typical example of DNA-fabricated nanocarrier (DNA box) for encapsulation of biomolecules. 7 Later, functionalization strategies, such as the integration of aptamers, allowed construction of more advanced DNA boxes with the controllable opening-closing performance of box/lid to allow for demand-driven freight exposure/release (box opening) for simultaneous biosensing and the triggering of a therapeutic effect only at the desired site (cancer cells). In addition, due to the unique sequence of DNA molecule used in the construction of these finite-sized DNs, the resulting structures are fully addressable and adaptable in terms of conjugation with a variety of functional units such as small molecules, macromolecules and inorganic nanoparticles that can be easily and accurately (with nanometer precision) placed anywhere on or in such structures (Table 1) .
DNA objects can fall in two categories, as static and dynamic formats. While dynamic formats such as walkers, tweezers, rotor/motor, etc. are capable of cycling movements and stepping/walking on defined DNA tracks using energy derived from DNA strand displacement, the use of static formats is widely accepted and furthur advanced in the context of cancer theranostics and nano drug delivery vehicles for cancer monitoring and treatment. Accordingly, this review aims to provide an overview of the current design formats, benefits and applications of static DNA nanostructures (DNs) including DNA origami nanostructures (DONs), DNA arrays/bioreactors, DNA polyhedra (DNA cage), DNA nanoflower, hydrogel, dendrimer and DNA nanoswitch as emerging promising platforms for cancer treatment in the preclinical settings.
DNA nanostructures have been extensively used for the study and manipulation of biological processes, which is critical to understand the molecular mechanism underlying pathological/disease-related condition in biomedicine. DN has also found numerous applications in the field of biosensing, detection, treatment, and drug/gene delivery of various cargoes, including nucleic acids, proteins, aptamers, siRNA, miRNAs, and nanoparticles. Accordingly, functionalized DNA structures with theranostic targeting moieties were used for the simultaneous mapping and targeting of various genetic, immunological, infectious, cancer and metabolic diseases. (see Table 1 ). 8 In this section, we will explain the use of static DNs in biomedicine and oncology practice.
As a key method for the production of DN, DNA origami objects can be adapted in both static and dynamic forms. Looking at the methods for production of DN, there are the scaffold-free tile assembly method ( Figure 1A ) and the scaffold DNA origami method ( Figure 1B) . The multi-strand tile method is a bottomup approach used in the first preparation of two-directional DNA polyhedra. In short, in this process, each tile is made from several single stranded DNA (ssDNA) with sticky ends, where cohesion between complementary strands from different tiles can lead to the assembly of larger structures such as 2D arrays as well as polyhedra ( Figure 1A ). In the meantime, DNA origami follows a top-down scaffold-mediated approach in which a long ssDNA usually M13 genomic DNA is forced to fold into DONs using short ssDNA oligonucleotides called staples. What's more, staple act as docking sites for functionalization by nanoparticles and biomolecules. In this way, and with the help of computer programs DNA origami objects can be designed and assembled in almost any form. 99 These modifications together with biocompatibility and biostability [100] [101] [102] have made DNA origami nanostructures suitable platforms for targeted delivery, imaging, and controlled release of therapeutic cargoes. 14, [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] DONs are functional as immune-activating programmable adjuvants. 33 They are also efficient as simultaneous dual-modality bioimaging and cancer targeting nanotools in vivo 14 (Figure 2A ). In addition, DONs can be used to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy ( Figure 2B ), 108 reduce drug side effects, and bypass drug resistance. 19, 30 Notably, DONs with a different twist allow tuning drug release kinetics of the DNA intercalating Doxorubicin (Dox) for optimum delivery to tumor cells ( Figure 2C ). 21, 107 Recently, DNA origami ultrasensitive biosensors namely DNA origami nanoantennas have been successfully adapted for biosensing and superresolution microscopy of Zika-virus nucleic acids at the single molecule level. 109 More recently, DONs have been shown to be useful tools for investigating antigen-antibody interactions to determine the strongest binding to antibodies in the immune system affecting antibody development for cancer immunotherapy and the vaccine development. In this way, DNA origami was used to represent nanoscale patterns of antigens. This is the first report to provide detailed information on how the antigen distances ranging from 3 to 17 nm can affect the binding affinity of mono and bivalent antibodies, as they have been shown to bind strongly to two antigens when a preferable 16 nm antigenic distance is reached. 110 Similarly, DNA origami nanoarrays can interrogate the clustering behavior of cell-surface receptors, because DN allows the representation of receptor ligands in an extremely customizable manner, with adjustable factors such as ligand number, spatial localization and, multivalency. 111 As proof of concept, they are used to study epidermal growth factor (EGF) and integrin signaling with nanoscale spatial resolution. That, using multivalent DNA biochips revealed cooperative work of EGF-integrin in modulating the behavior of melanoma cancer cell in a number and ratio-dependent manner. 112 Furthur examples of DON in cancer therapy and drug delivery can be found in. 99, 113 DNA Cage: Polyhedra DNA polyhedra has proven to be a promising class of drug-carriers frequently used for biomedical applications.
The advantage of polyhedra compared over other structures such as DNA origami is their small size and cost efficiency. One of the most popular structures in this class is the tetrahedron introduced by Turberfield. 114 This specific example can be constructed from only four strands with near-quantitative yields within 30 seconds and is compression-stable enough to be imaged by atomic force microscopy. Polyhedra represents a porous structure and is suitable for chemical modifications. In addition, it can be reconfigured with a high load capacity by external triggers for on-command drug release. Numerous applications in multi-modality medical diagnostics and treatments ( Figure 3 ) are proposed for these structures. 115 DNA polyhedra can be filled with one or more nanoparticles ( Figure 3A ), 20,93 proteins (eg, cytochrome C ( Figure 3B ), 116 β-galactosidase, 117 catabolite activator protein (CAP), 83 nucleic acids (eg, siRNA), 50 or other biomolecules 118 to enable their passive or active on-target delivery. For example, encapsulation affords conditional activation of caged enzymes/transcription factors upon exposure to their specific protein/DNA substrates. 83 Alternatively, the device protects its cargo (eg, siRNA) from nuclease degradation and site-specific cleavage. 50 The surface modification of DNA polyhedra with diseasespecific markers (eg, folate or oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1"" (LOX-1)) not only leads to active targeting but also to more than 30-40-fold internalization efficiency. 119, 120 DNs can encapsulate toxic and hydrophobic agents, such as Dox for efficient chemotherapy of cancer cells while reducing damage to normal cells. 121 The decoration of the Dox-encapsulated DNA cage with tumor-penetrating peptide increases the cellular uptake of DNA tetrahedron for the targeted administration of toxic chemotherapeutic in vitro ( Figure 3C ). 122 Dox-loaded DNA nanoblocks are found in the endocytic vesicles after entry into the target cells, where the acidic milieu triggers the release of drugs from these DNA nanostructures and induces selective augmented cytotoxic actions of Dox (>40 times) on folate receptor expressing cancer cells, while promoting the degradation of nanostructures that prevents their accumulation in the cells. 120 DNA tetrahedra are examples of DNA nanocages for large molecules or as building blocks for more complex nano-devices enabling rapid and reliable assembly with quantitative yields, in vitro and in vivo structural stability, and plasticity. 7, 114, 123 As proof of concept, DNA tetrahedra that can easily penetrate mammalian cells have been shown to be stable in cytoplasm. 59 A recent report also showed that multivalent DNA tetrahedrons functionalized with CpG motifs are permeable to cells and stimulate an immune response with applications in vaccine development and immunotherapy. 35 SiRNA administration using DNA tetrahedra was reported as a vehicle for targeted gene therapy. The adaptability of the design permits precise control of nanoparticle size, the spatial orientation, and density of targeting ligands on the nanoparticle surface or the inside, which could lead to enhanced delivery of the siRNAs into cells and efficient gene silencing. 124 Moreover, DNA polyhedra were used as carriers of chemotherapeutics to overcome multi-drug resistance in cancer cells. 118 Similarly, aptamerdecorated DNA icosahedral nanoparticles were used to deliver Dox molecules. 58 The construction of cage-like DNA structures called nanosuitcases was reported for siRNA loading and ondemand release upon recognition of an oligonucleotide marker (eg, mRNA or a microRNA (miRNA)( Figure 3D ). 50 In addition, the pH-triggered controlled release of Dox-intercalated nanoring functionalized with mucin aptamer (MUC1) was shown to have therapeutic potential for breast cancer. 125 In another example, hybrid systems such as DNA polyhedroncaged gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were produced for the controlled release of Dox when triggered by pH and DNA enzyme (T7 exonuclease). 93 Moreover, DNA tetrahedron structures are used as molecular probes with high-sensitivity for DNA target 
Another advantage of DNA origami which deserves to be discussed in a separate section, is its potential for the fabrication of DNA arrays/ bioreactors, which can be achieved by sitespecific functionalization of DNA origami structures with proteins, nanoparticles, antibodies, enzymes, etc. (Figure 4 ) with well-defined regularity and periodicity is of great interest to the scientific community. 127 Applications include sensing, catalysis, and highly ordered device fabrication. 128 The addressability of DNA origami structures enables site-specific localization of several functional groups on their surfaces. Functionality could be achieved by i) covalently bound chemical groups (eg, amine, thiol, and carboxyl groups) or molecules (eg, biotin), or ii) DNA overhangs (eg, aptamers). 129 In one of these systems, the chemical conjugation of amino-modified DNA oligonucleotides was demonstrated with chlorohexane or benzylguanine groups as orthogonal tags for the genetic modification of proteins of interest fused with Halo-Tag or Snap-tag, respectively. Authors reported orthogonal modified DNA origami by decorating DNA origami with multiple proteins including mKate-Snap, CCP-Halo, and mSTV, which resemble the characteristic of human face including mouth, eyes, and nose, respectively ( Figure 4A ). 130 Another study used DNA-binding potential of zinc finger proteins for site-specific protein positioning on DNA origami.- 131 Previous formats of DNA nanoarrays were also attempted in 2005 by DNA hybridization-mediated adhesion of Au nanoparticles of different sizes to prescribed locations on DNA tiles, producing alternating rows of the two components ( Figure 4B ). 132 DNA nanotubes conjugated with two enzymes, horseradish peroxidase, and glucose oxidase, demonstrated enzymatic cascade, as an example of the nanoscale DNAbased bioreactor. 127 Moreover, punched DNA origami assembly was exploited for the design of robust and precisely programmed 2D streptavidin nanoarrays by the periodical embedding of biotinylated nanowells in DNA origami structures ( Figure 4C ). 133 
Long, single-stranded DNA and pyrophosphate released from (in vitro) polymerase reactions can form dense, compact organic-inorganic composite nanomaterials, known as nanoflowers (NFs). 134 In contrast to the key role of DNA base pairing in DNA nanostructures formation, NF assembly is independent of DNA hybridization. In addition, unlike other DNs, the shape of nanoflowers cannot be precisely programmed ( Figure 5 ). 135 NF can be assembled using DNA building blocks by a PCR reaction such as rolling circle amplification (RCA). This reaction requires only a primer and template DNA to control over size, construct and functionalization of nanoflowers. This means that the rational design of any RCRsuitable templates allows the elongated DNA building blocks to carry a large number of concatemer functional or structural moieties, which further condense into NFs. 136 Due to the dense DNA packaging, NFs resist to nuclease degradation, dissociation or denaturation. Recently, the NF blooming (formation) principle has been used to design a simple and sensitive electrochemical biosensing system. In this preparation, the NF blooming in the nanochannels has been tailored to occur upon binding of target miRNA, followed by binding of a circle template DNA and a specific primer to the captured miRNA, triggering RCA and NF blooming in the nanochannels. NF formation increased steric hindrance in the channels, which reduced the anodic current of potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]), thus producing enhanced electrochemical detection signals ( Figure 5A ). 135 In addition to excellent biostability, NFs exhibit excellent photostability. In this sense, construction of aptamer conjugated multicolor fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-NFs is reported with applications in multiplexed cellular bioimaging and drug screening, in which NF were integrated with three different fluorophores (FAM, Cy3, and ROX), therapeutic drug payloads (Dox), and two aptamers (sgc8 and MUC 1). In addition, single wavelength excitation leads to multi-fluorescence emissions of NF, allowing monitoring of drug transport for targeted drug delivery ( Figure 5B ). 10 Moreover, immuno-nanoflowers have been developed for nuclease resistance and efficient CpG delivery. 36 CpG NFs were found to be potent immunostimulators capable of triggering the proliferation of macrophagelike cells that stimulated the secretion of immunostimulatory cytokines that induced apoptosis and necrosis of cancer cells. Moreover, pH-responsive multifunctional DNA NFs containing cancer-targeting aptamer, fluorophores, and Dox molecules were used to prevent drug efflux and improve drug retention in MDR cells, thus bypassing MDR and reducing side effects ( Figure 5C ). 136, 137 In addition, using microflower nanosystem, synergistic nanovaccines were constructed for effective immunotherapy of cancer. The NFs were formulated to comprise intertwining DNA-RNA nanocapsules (iDR-NCs) conjugated with DNA CpG, STAT3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) adjuvants, as well as tumor-specific peptide neoantigens. shRNA in iDR-NCs synergistically activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), primed CD8+ T cells, induced T cell memory, and markedly suppressed the progression of neoantigen-specific colorectal tumors ( Figure 5B ). 68 In addition, water remediation -using magnetite nanoparticles that absorb and remove heavy metals-can be achieved by hybrid nano-flowers consisting of single-crystalline petals coated with magnetite nanoparticles. Additionally, hybrid nanoflowers (hNFs) consisting of organic (enzymes)-inorganic (metal ions) particles is reported to enhance catalytic activities and stability of proteins under various experimental conditions. 138,139
As relatively complicated DNs, DNA dendrimer with a branched configuration can be developed by the facile modular assembly. DNA dendrimers are layer-by-layer selfassembled functional branched DNA units (eg, Y-shaped building blocks) made through predesigned base-pairing hybridization. These somewhat bulkier DNs form promising scaffolds for versatile biomedical applications ( Figure 6 ). For example, they can accommodate more docking sites for loading drugs or other functional materials.
Moreover, by implementing functional DNA units, these structures can be constructed into targeted and stimuliresponsive drug delivery systems. Also, sterically crowded conformations, homogeneous controlled sizes, and structural stability are additional advantages of dendrimeric nanostructures. Furthermore, they can be used as biosensing devices. For instance, DNA dendrimers coupled with DNA nanomachines (DNA circuits) has realized an ultrasensitive biosensor with a detection limit of 0.0661 pg/mL and 0.062 nM for laminin 15 and KRAS gene fragment ( Figure 6A ), 140 respectively. Tailoring the capture and reporter DNA/protein units can extend the prognostic value of such dendrimer-based self-amplification system for detection of a different disease-related species with high sensitivity in biological samples. Moreover, achieving a therapeutic effect, catalytically self-assembled siRNA-based gene silencing via functionalized DNA dendritic complexes was constructed. Incorporated sgc8c aptamers to DNA dendrimers enabled targeting of overexpressed protein tyrosine 141 Another study demonstrated that the formulation of dendrimeric siRNA improves condensation, stability, and gene silencing efficiencies. 52 Moreover, branched DNA constructs -containing anti-miRNA-have been used for oncomiRNA targeting of cancer. In another report, a multifunctional dendrimeric-based system composing of tumor-targeting ligands -such as MUC1, AS1411, and ATP aptamers-was used for high loading and controlled delivery of an anthracycline drug called ""epirubicin"" to cancer cells. MUC1 and AS1411 aptamer were coated on the surface of dendrimer to assist crossing the cellular and nuclear membranes, respectively. Meanwhile, ATP aptamer incorporated in the building blocks directed dendrimer to the ATP-enriched lysozymes where more dendrimer disassembly can occur. 28 Furthermore, ligase-independent efficient self-assembly of DNA dendrimer is reported by annealing DNA units with elongated adhesive ends. These structures were used for delivery of immunostimulatory CpG DNA encoding tumor necrosis factor-α to immune cells. 142 Programmable DNA dendrimers coated with CpG-containing hairpin-loops were found to trigger stronger immune responses than those conjugated with linear CpG. Further surface functionalization of DNA dendrimer with TAT -a classic cell-penetrating peptide-enhanced cell internalization and cytokines production ( Figure 6B ). 34 Possessing a similar mesh-like structure formed out of branched building blocks, DNA hydrogels with even broader biomedical as well as bioelectronic applications are developed, which we discuss in the next chapter.
A further advantage of DNA as a natural polymer is its capability to act as anirreplaceable building block for the construction of swollen networks of cross-linked DNA in an aqueous solution called DNA hydrogels. 143 DNA can be the only component of a hydrogel, the backbone or cross-linker, which connects the main building blocks (hybrid hydrogels) through physical entanglement or chemical reactions (Figure 7) . 144, 145 Hybrid hydrogels can lead to many preferred properties that would otherwise not be achievable by other nanostructures. These properties include biocompatibility, mass transport of ions, nutrients, proteins, drug, etc., biodegradability, mimicking dynamic nature of surrounding microenvironment (eg, extracellular matrix (ECM)), mechanical properties (porosity, stiffness, adhesion, swelling and phase transition (sol-gel) and stimuli-responsiveness. 145 These smart polymers afford controlled disruption/deformation of the DNA network at the desired microenvironment to achieve on-target cargo release for a therapeutic effect ( Figure 7A ). 146 From this point of view, tissue engineering and cell therapy for regenerative medicine can benefit from the soft nature of DNA hydrogels allowing potential imitation of the physiological environment and living matrices, while porous structure mainly benefits accommodation of therapeutic payloads. 147 Different types of DNA building blocks can be used to produce these hydrogels, including single-stranded DNA branched double-stranded DNA, or Y-shaped DNA or Xshaped DNA through intermolecular i-motif structures, enzyme ligation, DNA hybridization, or enzyme polymerization. Although the use of DNA hydrogels in the clinic is not yet practiced, nonetheless, they already find numerous application in drug delivery 146 sensing, 148 tissue engineering, 149, 150 3D cell culture, 149 providing a template for nanoparticle synthesis, 92, 151 and cell transplant therapy, 152 among others (see for review). 153 Hydrogels are popular nanostructures for tissue engineering because they can be tailor-made as biomimetics of ECM. DNA hydrogels are applicable for wound dressing with fluorescent and anti-bacterial potential. Due to their multifunctionality, they can simultaneously perform biosensing, and bioimaging tasks in living cells, as well. 97, 98, 154 In terms of their biomedical applications, DNA gels nanostructures can be used for in situ encapsulation and preservation by protecting their cargoes from degradation, as reported for camptothecin (CPT), a DNA-binding drug, as well as porcine insulin. 155 Interestingly, the formation of target-triggered DNA hydrogel has been harnessed as an effective tool for live singlecell isolation by liquid biopsy. 61 For example, a DNA staple strand with aptamer-toehold biblocks is shown to specifically recognize EpCAM, a cell surface biomarker expressed by circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Binding of the aptamer to EpCAM triggers subsequent aptamer-triggered hybridization chain reaction (HCR) via toehold-initiated branch migration for simultaneous capturing and clocking of live single/clustered CTCs in porous DNA hydrogel with minimal cell damage. Moreover, controlled decloaking of CTCs was affordable using defined chemical stimuli to release intact living CTCs for subsequent culture and live cell analysis ( Figure 7B ). 61 Interestingly, Dgel made of branched cross-linked DNA has found application for integration of plasmid-coding genes to envision a cell-free gene/protein synthesis system for production of different types of proteins/genes with extremely high production yields. 156 In comparison to a linear plasmid, a high yield of over 300 times 157 and~50 times is reported for protein and mRNA expression, respectively. 75 In view of the high RNA productivity of the Dgel, a recent study has reported a DNA hydrogel that can be used as RNA-producing machinery for gene regulation inside live cells. For this purpose, a plasmid carrying the gene transcribing siRNA against a target gene (green fluorescent protein (GFP)) was introduced into the gel scaffold. Such DNA hydrogel was capable to effectively shut down fluorescent protein expression in live cells. 75 Another study, reported an albumin-DNA hybrid hydrogel for the controlled release of Rho-inhibiting C3 toxin for targeted inhibition of osteoclast formation and activity and possible application in local treatment of bone disease such as osteoporosis. This system is desirable with regard to its selfhealing and injectable nature, DNA hybridization-mediated rapid gelation under physiological conditions, and the possibility to be loaded with specific cargoes (active proteins) and promote their spatiotemporal controlled release. 67 With the aim of cancer-targeting, multifunctional and programmable aptamer-based DNA nanoassembly (AptNA) is reported using three Y-shaped building units; each incorporating different functional elements including targeting aptamer (sgc8), a therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide (MDR1 siRNA), and intercalated anticancer drug (Dox). This DNA nanohydrogel is a promising anti-cancer material due to its modularity, multifunctionality, programmability, excellent biocompatibility, and biostability. It also provides active targeting and controllable transportation of drug to the on-target cells. Moreover, using such a system drug resistance was reduced due to inhibition of P-gp expression -the anti-cancer drug efflux pump receptor-by the MDR1 siRNA. 158 Similarly, catalytic hybridization was used for assembly of aptamer-based nanohydrogels (Y-gel-Apt), by employing two Y-shaped monomers (YMA, YMB) and a DNA linker (LK) bearing disulfide linkages and sticky ends. YMA contained a DNAzyme sequence for targeting MMP-9 and antisense oligonucleotide sequence in LK that enabled targeting of c-raf-1a tumor proliferation marker. Sticky ends were used for hybridization-mediated self-assembly whereas disulfide linkages led to the rapid fragmentation of nanohydrogels under cancer reductive environment, enabling a stimuli-responsive effective gene therapy ( Figure 7C ). 54 More examples of aptamer-incorporated hydrogels for theranostics applications are overviewed elsewhere.
Polymeric nanostructures such as hydrogels, liposomal/ micellar nanocarriers or DNA-based hydrogels/nanostructures equipped with DNA switches such as azobenzene ( Figure 8A ) 159 /disulfide bonds are examples of static nanoswitches utilized for selective delivery of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells in response to environmental triggers such as hypoxia/pH/redox actuators. 147 For example, disulfide-crosslinked nanohydrogels intercalated with Dox undergo fragmentation upon exposure to reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) or glutathione (GSH). These redox/pH dual stimuliresponsive nanohydrogels make promising candidates for delivering anti-cancer drugs because of their biocompatibility, adequate drug loading capacity, biodegradability, controlled yet fast drug release potential ( Figure 8B ). 160 Moreover, bioreducible nanohydrogels-like nanocapsules (NCs) were reported to actively target cancer cells coated with folic acid. 27 Light-switchable aptamer-based nanoconstructs were used for targeting and release of chemotherapeutics within the cancerous milieu. These complexes consisted of lipidated versions of a hepatocyte growth factor receptor (cMet) binding aptamer and a separate lipidated GC-rich DNA hairpin motif bearing intercalated Dox. Multiple 2',6'-dimethylazobenzene moieties were incorporated into the Dox-binding motif to trigger the release of the chemotherapeutics by photoisomerization. The combined features of these nanocarriers increased serum nuclease resistance, favored their import into cells, allowed the selective photo-induced release of the chemotherapeutic into the targeted cells, and enhanced cell mortality. 74 In addition, pH-responsive and light-responsive DNA microcapsules that encapsulated different loads including Dox-modified dextran, tetramethylrhodamine-modified dextran, CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, MP-11 and microperoxidase-11 has been described for controlled cargo release and cancer therapy in vitro. 26 The pH-responsive microcapsules composed of a cytosine-rich layer cross-linked by nucleic acid bridges and the light-responsive microcapsules were made of photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl-phosphatemodified DNA shells. 26 In another study, reduction-responsive hydrogel nanoparticles are utilized for siRNA delivery and targeted gene silencing. 53 Furthermore, near-infrared light-responsive hybrid drug delivery platform composed of Au-Ag nanorods (Au-Ag NRs) and DNA cross-linked polymeric shell was reported in which near infra-red (NIR) irradiation induce photothermal effect of the Au-Ag NRs which leads to rapid heating of the nanogel, and promote programmed and swift release of captured drugs into the target environment. 161 Likewise, reversible DNA hybridization allows specific DNA oligonucleotides to act as triggers for autonomous switching of nanostructures to load or release the therapeutic targets. For example, aptamer-cross linked hydrogels were utilized to control the release of drugs and nanoparticles in response to binding of the DNA aptamer to small metabolites such as adenosine, AMP, and ATP ( Figure 8C ). 162, 163 
Since its inception in the early 1980s and the invention of DNA origami in 2006, DNA nanotechnology has made remarkable strides towards a veriety of applications. In view of our interest in the era of cancer research, we provided an overview of the advances in DNA nanotechnology at the interface of static DNA-based devices and their broad applications in the field of bio/nanomedicine (Table 1) . Compared to other nanomaterials, such as polymeric, organic, metallic, and lipid-based nanoparticles, etc., the beauty of DN can be attributed to the simple principle of base pairing that allows construction of an unlimited number of nanostructures with different sizes, shapes, charges, and modularity to serve for a specific purpose. For example, DNA polyhedra (DNA box), and hydrogel are both porous structures that can accommodate therapeutic agent inside while functional ligands/moieties can be coated on the surface of DN. DNA box toolkits are meant for on-command opening (provided by aptamer) and exposure of cloaked cytotoxic drugs, when only the correct trigger (eg, ATP) is available, allowing effective on-target drug delivery. In addition to its function as a drug carrier, the hydrogel structure offers an additional advantage as it can undergo reversible changes of shape (gel/sol state), size (shrunken/swollen) and charge (deprotonated/protonated). Such potential to capture and adapt to changes in the microenvironment is important for the design of nanocarriers taking into account the dynamic and heterogeneous microenvironment of cancer cells. For example, pH-responsive hydrogel (provided by azo-linker) allows the shrunk hydrogel to enter the endo-lysosomes where the size expansion occurs within the low pH endo-lysosomal vesicles, resulting in a larger pore size and thus the leakage of cytotoxic drugs to induce cancer cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, acid-triggered protonated hydrogel that results in size expansion and electrostatic repulsion of DN promotes endo-lysosomal burst release of hydrogel into the cytosol. Under normal pH, the hydrogel can shrink back to its original size, and its subsequent transport outside the dead cell starts another cycle of penetration into the nearby cancer cells. 164 This way, recycling hydrogel can penetrate into the deeper regions of the tumor by peeling off tumor layers one after another to envision an enhanced therapeutic index for cancer therapy.

138,8cfe567d42fa459cb4364e240ddfe29629d03f85,"Respiratory pathogens are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis and exacerbations of asthma at all ages; however, little is known about the airway microbiome in the elderly.
Aim of the study: To identify respiratory pathogens in the induced sputum (IS) of elderly asthmatics, and to determine the association between pathogens and the markers of asthma activity.
Material and methods: Twenty-nine subjects with stable asthma, 15 above 65 years of age and 14 aged 30-49 years, underwent clinical evaluation, fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement, and sputum induction. Pathogens were detected by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The periostin concentration of IS supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum eosinophil cationic protein and total IgE levels were measured by ImmunoCAP.
Conclusions: Despite the existence of differences in some clinical and inflammatory characteristics of asthma between elderly and non-elderly asthmatics, the pathogen detection rates in the IS from the two groups are similar.","Ageing is often characterised by a progressive decline in immune response, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections and poor response to vaccination [1] . Clinical observations suggest that lower respiratory tract infections may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and are important triggers for asthma exacerbations [2] . Asthma in the elderly seems to be a distinct phenotype with higher severity and exacerbation rates [3] , which may be associated with the deterioration of immune function observed in the airways in the aged population [4] .
The airway microbiome might have a profound role on the development, persistence, and clinical course of chronic inflammatory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [5] . The presence of respiratory viruses during childhood has been identified as a significant risk factor for asthma in adolescences and adults [6] , while similar observations have been made for atypical bacteria [7] . Viruses, such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza viruses, are the most common causative factors for asthma exacerbation [8] . In clinically stable periods of asthma, both viruses and bacteria are detected in the airways [9, 10] , but the significance of the persistent presence of those pathogens in the airways remains unclear. While the majority of studies indicate that the detection rate of respiratory viruses in patients with asthma and healthy subjects is similar [10] , they have been found to differ with regard to the bacterial composition of the airways [11] .
Information on the respiratory pathogens of the lower airways and their relationship with the nature of asthma in elderly asthmatics is limited, mostly because of the risk and inconvenience associated with direct and invasive methods of airway lumen sampling. Induced sputum (IS) allows for non-invasive assessment of lower airway inflammation and can be employed to detect respiratory pathogens in the lower respiratory tract. This technique was chosen for the present study, to test the hypothesis that elderly patients with asthma display a different profile of respiratory pathogens in the airways as compared to non-elderly asthmatics, and that this profile may be related to local airway and/or systemic inflammation.
Twenty-nine clinically stable, non-smoking patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma, 15 elderly (above 65 years of age) and 14 non-elderly (aged 30-49 years), were included to the study. None of the individuals demonstrated any symptoms of infection or had used antibiotics or oral corticosteroids for six weeks prior to the procedure. The level of asthma control was established according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2011 guidelines [12] and assessed by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) [13] . Severe asthma was defined according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) Workshop 2000 criteria [14] . Spirometry was performed according to European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards [15] , using a PNEU-MO RS spirometer (Abcmed Artmed, Kraków, Poland). The panel of skin prick tests (Allergopharma, Reinbek, Germany) included the following allergens: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, cat, dog, rabbit, hamster, guinea pig, rat, swine, birch, grass mix, mugwort, plantain, Alternaria tenuis, and Cladosporium herbarum. A positive result was defined as a wheal of 3 mm or more in diameter. Atopy was diagnosed as the presence of at least one positive skin test.
FeNO was measured by using the online single breath method with NIOX (Aerocrine, Solna, Sweden), according to ATS guidelines [16] . The measurement was performed before the sputum induction.
Sputum induction was performed according to Pin et al. with some modifications [17, 18] . Briefly, patients received 200 µg of salbutamol from a metered dose inhaler followed by inhalation of increasing doses of hypertonic saline solution (3%, 4%, 5%) using an ultrasonic nebuliser UltraNeb (Devilbiss Health Care Inc., Somerset, USA). Patients were asked to expectorate sputum after gargling mouthwash. Spirometry was performed before the procedure, 15 minutes af-ter salbutamol inhalation, and every seven minutes after the start of the saline nebulisation. When their FEV1 decreased by 20% or more, the sputum induction was stopped.
The sputum sample was kept on ice and processed within two hours. Dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, USA) was added to the selected plaques of sputum and mixed for 15 min on ice. The sample was filtered using a 52-µcm nylon gauze (Surtex, Lodz, Poland). The total cell count was measured using a haemocytometer and centrifuged. The cell pellets were resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 75 µl of this cell suspension was used to perform the cytospin slides stained with RapiHem solution, a variant of May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining (Aqua-Med, Lodz, Poland). Only smears with less than 50% of non-squamous cells were considered to be adequate for the differential cell counting. On each slide, 300 cells were counted, and the macrophage, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil values were expressed as percentages of the total number of inflammatory cells. The supernatants were stored frozen at -80° for further analysis. 
Viral DNA or RNA was extracted from sputum using a QIAamp ® MinElute ® Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To synthesise cDNA, reverse transcription was performed using a RevertAid H Minus First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA). Each cDNA was subjected to multiplex PCR using a SEEPLEX RV15 ACE Detection Kit (Seegene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The multiplex PCR detected rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses (HEV), parainfluenza viruses 1 (PIV1), 2 (PIV2), 3 (PIV3), and 4 (PIV4), influenza viruses A (FluA) and B (FluB), respiratory syncytial viruses A (RSVA) and B (RSVB), coronaviruses (229E/NL63 and OC43), adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), and human bocaviruses 1/2/3/4 (HBoV). The multiplex PCR products were visualised by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel.
The serum concentrations of total IgE (kU/l) were determined by ImmunoCAP Total IgE (Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden), and the concentrations of ECP (µg/l) were determined using ImmunoCAP ECP (Phadia AB, Upsala, Sweden), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Periostin was measured in the IS supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan, Hubei, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Comparisons between the groups were performed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman rank correlation was used to evaluate the correlation between variables. Results are expressed as median and 25 th to 75 th percentiles. The statistical analysis was performed using Statistica (StatSoft, USA); p values < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant.
The study was approved by the local Bioethics Committee, and all study subjects provided their informed consent.
On average, the elderly patients with asthma had significantly lower respiratory function, as well as less current asthma control according to GINA criteria and a lower ACT score, although both groups demonstrated similar disease severity based on the ATS Workshop 2000 criteria ( Table 1 ). The distribution of inflammatory cells in the induced sputum varied depending on the age: older patients had a higher mean percentage of eosinophils (p < 0.05) and lymphocytes (p < 0.05), and a lower percentage of macrophages (p < 0.05) in IS (Table 2 ). However, the elderly and non-elderly asthmatics had similar mean FeNO levels and concentrations of such eosinophilic inflammation markers as periostin in IS, ECP, and total IgE in serum (Table 1 ). There 
The molecular technique revealed the presence of S. pneumoniae in the IS from all asthmatic patients, both elderly and non-elderly, and H. influenzae in half the patients from each group (Table 3) . Chlamydophila pneumoniae was detected in one subject from the elderly group and one from the non-elderly group. All sputa were negative for M. pneumoniae, Legionella, and B. pertussis.
Respiratory viruses were detected in the induced sputum from the majority of patients in both groups: in 11 (73.3%) elderly and 10 (71.4%) non-elderly individuals. The most commonly detected virus was Flu A followed by RSV A and RSV B (Table 3) . No differences were observed in the detection rates of viruses between elderly and non-elderly patients.
Neither asthma severity according to GINA or ATS criteria nor current asthma control assessed by the ACT were found to correlate with the presence of respiratory pathogens in the IS of asthmatics patients. In elderly asthmatics, but not in the non-elderly group, a few associations between the presence of specific respiratory viruses in the IS and respiratory function/immunological parameters were found. Flu A-positive patients had lower FVC% predicted than negative ones (81.8% pred. ±19.9 vs. 100.4 % pred. ±12,9; p < 0.05). The presence of RSV B was associated with a lower percentage of lymphocytes in the IS (28.7% ±12.6 vs. 5.5 % ±9.5; p < 0.05), and the RSV A-positive patients had lower tIgE concentration in the serum than RSV A-negative elderly individuals (19.2 kU/l ±17.7 vs. 85.2 kU/l ±64.1; p < 0.05).
This study is the first to use the IS technique to compare detection rates of respiratory pathogens in the airways of elderly and non-elderly patients with asthma. The total number of positive samples and the profile of respiratory pathogens detected in the induced sputum by molecular techniques were found to be similar in elderly and non-elderly individuals. Bronchial asthma, although heterogeneous, has been considered to be, on average, more severe in the elderly population and associated with increased exacerbation rates mostly related to respiratory infections [19] . Our elderly patients tended to have, on average, more severe disease, as expressed by lower respiratory function, and less current asthma control over the previ- ous four weeks, demonstrated by GINA criteria and a lower mean ACT score. In addition, the elderly patients had higher sputum eosinophilia and lymphocytosis levels than the non-elderly patients, suggesting the presence of different types of airway inflammation in senior individuals. Although a previous study documents a tendency toward neutrophilic inflammation in the IS from elderly asthmatics, no correlation between neutrophilia and severity of the disease was found [20] . Another study found older asthmatics with fixed obstruction to have a higher percentage of eosinophils and elevated levels of ECP in the induced sputum compared to their peers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), despite an increased percentage of neutrophils in the sputum [21] . Thus, the increased percentage of eosinophils in the IS of elderly patients in our study may reflect the proposed inflammatory profile in the airway mucosa of this population of asthmatics. On the other hand, mean levels of surrogate markers of the airway eosinophilic inflammation (FeNO, ECP, and sputum periostin) were similar in both groups, not confirming differences in the type of inflammation between groups.
Ageing has been associated with several immune abnormalities in both the innate and adaptive immune systems, and consequently with deceased immune response to infections [1] . In this context, the observation of similar detection rate and profile of respiratory pathogens in the induced sputum is rather unexpected. However, our patients had stable asthma during the sputum sampling, and one cannot exclude that the difference in the microbiome between elderly and non-elderly asthmatics might be seen during the disease exacerbations Although respiratory pathogens have been detected with increased frequency during asthma exacerbations, they may persist in the airways of asthmatics between exacerbation episodes, and it has been postulated that latent or persistent infection may contribute to the chronicity of the airway inflammation [22] . However, a cross-sectional study by Harju et al. [9] reports similar detection rates of respiratory viruses in the IS of patients with clinically stable asthma and healthy controls. Similarly, in a prospective study by Tucharelli et al. [23] the detection rates of 14 respiratory viruses were comparable in clinically stable asthmatics and in healthy controls at three time points. Accordingly, in non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the percentage of viral detection did not vary between asthmatic children and controls [24] . In contrast, the presence of HRV in the lung tissue samples from stable patients was found to be higher in asthmatics than in healthy controls [25] . Thus, the presence or absence of respiratory pathogens in BAL or induced sputum may not reflect the persistence of infection of the airway mucosa.
Although the detection rate and profile of respiratory viruses in IS was similar in elderly and non-elderly patients with asthma, the presence of pathogens was associated with some clinical characteristics only in older subjects. The presence of Influenza A virus in the airways of stable asthma patients (without any clinical signs of infection) was associated with lower respiratory function and RSV B with a lower percentage of lymphocytes in the IS. In a study by Woś et al. [25] the presence of HRV was associated with lower spirometric parameters as compared to HRV-negative subjects. Furthermore, in our study the presence of RSV B was associated with a lower percentage of lymphocytes in the IS and the RSV A with lower total IgE concentration in the serum in elderly individuals; however, the significance of this findings remains unclear.
Our study has several limitations. The groups were relatively small, which may have affected the variability of results. The samples were collected during late autumn and winter, which may be connected with more frequent exposure to respiratory infections. Qualitative RT-PCR did not allow active replication indicating active infection to be distinguished from residuals of viral or bacterial DNA or RNA from past infections. The discrepancies between the positivity rates of the respiratory bacteria and viruses shown in the above-mentioned studies may be related to different methods of obtaining samples and detecting pathogens. Supernatants from induced sputum were used as source material, and multiplex RT PCR assays were used for analysis. Harju et al. [9] report higher detection rates of viruses in induced sputum and throat swab samples compared to gelatine-filtered expired air, EBC, or nasal swabs. However, viral identification was not consistent between these methods or during the follow-up period. In a study by Falsey et al. [26] the identification of Bordetella pertussis in IS differed between supernatants and cells from patients with exacerbation of asthma. Hence, our results should be further confirmed in studies involving larger patient populations and, if possible, more direct airway sampling techniques.
In summary, our findings indicate that, despite some differences in the clinical and inflammatory characteristics of asthma between elderly and non-elderly patients, the microbial composition of IS samples from stable patients is similar.",The profile of respiratory pathogens in induced sputum of elderly and non-elderly asthmatics,"WARDZYŃSKA, ALEKSANDRA; PAWEŁCZYK, MAŁGORZATA; GŁOBIŃSKA, ANNA; MAKOWSKA, JOANNA S.; KOWALSKI, MAREK L.",Cent Eur J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7050048/,153,2345,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,22c00b12361acc7b59c2874d165c8f9bcee54b5d,"The 7-year medical education program in Taiwan has been established since 1949. More than 60 years later, many medical professionals have observed and voiced its deficiencies following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The deficiencies are three-fold: (1) specialties are excessively institutionalized, (2) students engage in passive learning and memorization, and (3) passing one written national examination serves as the means of granting permanent physician qualification. The situation has aroused concerns and discussions among medical professionals and educators for a new medical education program. Authorized by the Conference of Deans of Medical Schools in Taiwan, Prof. Chyi-Her Lin assembled a team for planning medical curricular reform. Subsequently, Prof. Shan-Chwen Chang organized a task force team which has been monitoring the new 6-year program since 2013. The aims of medical reform by Prof. Lin are (1) to eliminate the specialty training part, (2) to use innovative teaching methods to motivate students to learn proactively, and (3) to implement competency-based medical education. Now, the first class of physicians will enter the workplace in 2019, subject to various clinical challenges.","M edical education is a professional cultivating program in which a student is transformed from a layperson to a physician through systematic learning [1] . It is aimed at cultivating professional physicians who are devoted to lifelong learning and self-improvement. According to criticism from the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation in 1998, Taiwan's medical schools began to initiate curricular reform to improve several deficiencies in medical education [2] . During the transformation of Taiwan into a developed country, citizens began to question the high social status of physicians, and educational philosophic thoughts from the USA started to influence the traditional curriculum design. Considering contemporary societal needs, the medical education program should be transformed. This review presents an exploration of the roots underlying the medical educational reform over the past 30 years and the prospects of future physicians in Taiwan [3] .
Taiwan's society is increasingly diverse and democratic. The increasing national income has engendered lifestyle changes, leading to changes in the forms of diseases. The implementation Medical Education (WFME). For the response of global standards from WFME, several medical schools strived to facilitate the integration of basic science and clinical disciplines, besides, emphasis on interpersonal communication [6] . Since 2005, medical specialists and the government have collaborated on restructuring the local medical education program; the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan launched the postgraduate year program (PGY program) on a trial basis before officially launching it in 2011 [7] .
Since the launch of the program, physicians holding a practicing certificate must complete a PGY course in qualified hospitals before they can apply for specialty resident training. According to the comprehensively implemented 6-year medical education program, from 2019, medical graduates under the new PGY program will be required to 2-year training [8] . In this review, we report the disruption caused by the gap between the two education programs and propose possible solutions for the problems in the transition period.
Taiwan's medical education program has undergone five main transformations [ Table 1 ], as revealed by an analysis of the program design from various perspectives: First, the program previously emphasized individual discipline, but currently, the program emphasizes clinical case integration. Second, the program was previously based on those of other countries, but currently, the program is witnessing a transformation in accordance with Taiwan's higher education environment. Third, the program involved a one-stage learning process, but it currently involves a two-stage learning course, including undergraduate and PGY. Fourth, the program previously involved a superior elite education approach, and this has currently been transformed into a scientific education approach involving liberal humanism. Finally, the program previously applied a uniform teaching approach, and this has been replaced by a diverse, proactive, and innovative learning environment [9] .
Prof. Hsieh proposed an integrated course on basic and clinical sciences in 1992 [10, 11] . Moreover, the time-based educational approach adopted in the previous program has been restructured. Specifically, an outcome-based educational approach that is based on those of other countries transformed the old medical education program into a 6-year program and established criteria for qualified physician status according to the required professional abilities for health care [12] . Core competencies comprising various combinations of knowledge, skills, and attitudes are increasingly recognized and defined. Furthermore, the various clinical standards of physicians with different core competencies are combined to establish milestones for clinical physicians, the practice results of which are ultimately demonstrated in the clinical outcomes [13, 14] . Numerous countries have developed unique competency-based medical education (CBME) systems [15] . Canadian scholars recommended the implementation of a responsible and flexible learner-centered educational method instead of the time-based educational approach. They identified 10 common factors that can be categorized into four main themes as follows: Organizing framework, rationale, contrast with time, and implementation; and six subthemes: Outcomes and milestones defined, the curriculum of competencies, demonstrable abilities, assessment of competencies, learner center, and societal needs [13, 16] . Accordingly, in medical education, eliminating the discipline-centered teaching method might accelerate the diversified integration of courses oriented toward clinical practice and basic medicine. The essence of core-CBME should be thoroughly explored before the introduction of localized CBME in Taiwan [17] .
Physicians play a vital role in society. The book ""Educating Physician"" reveals the three main aspects of physician development: Cultivating expertise and relevant abilities to care for patients; developing inquiry and innovative thinking; and participating in social networks and contributing to society [3] . In the 21 st century, medical education involves the following objectives: Endeavoring to link theoretical knowledge and practical experience; creating opportunities for students' early engagement in patient care, thus enabling students to achieve in-depth learning when making reflections; and stimulating students' inquiries and critical thinking during problem-solving. Abraham Flexner emphasized the knowledge structure and liberal education; considered basic education on medical treatment as the foundation of medical education; highlighted the importance of communication skills, physical examination skills, and attitude in Hi-tech medical environments; and should be subjective to integration of evidence-based medicine and medical ethics to enable medical students to adapt to public perception toward future medical care [18] . On the basis of experiencing 23 years following the implementation of Taiwan's health insurance, the medical education program should promote community medicine and general medicine education, emphasize students' self-directed learning, and advocate the inquired and interactive teaching methods. Medical schools and educators devoted to invited faculty and curricular committee joined this evolution in medical education for decades. Organ-based and clinical cases were integrated to
The events in Taiwan society was labeled in arrowed-line chronologically (compiled by this study). PGY: Postgraduate year teaching plans to link all scientific praxis in human. There were generally three sections of the new program as follows: (1) premedical section, (2) integrated medical section, and (3) clinical medical section, at the same time, vertically combination with medical humanities and public health [ Table 2 ]. In addition, educators aimed at enabling students to experience the diverse roles of a physician, such as advocating patient welfare, developing and incorporating innovations, and collaborating with inter-professional team members in the workplace [3] . Thus, innovative and student-centered instructional methods were massively adopted, such as problem-based learning [19] .
In the current 6-year medical education program, students are granted qualification as physicians after graduation but short of the internship. They are equipped with clinical care skills and medical humanities knowledge, ingrained with the concept of lifelong learning. According to ""Educating Physician,"" patient care should be incorporated into clinical skill training programs. Because clinical skill training entails progressive advancement, the curriculum must facilitate students' continuous acquisition of knowledge and experience in patient care; such a curriculum can thus enable students to acquire in-depth knowledge of disease, engage in logical thinking during problem-solving, and achieve proficiency [3, 20] . The cognitive theory of teaching proposed by Anderson comprises four knowledge levels, namely practical knowledge, theoretical knowledge, procedural knowledge, and metacognitive knowledge, the highest level; this theory is reshaping the structure of the curriculum of medical education [21] . The overall goal of such a curriculum is to create a continuous and thorough medical learning process.
A medical education that highly integrates clinical learning in basic curriculum facilitates context-based reflection. By establishing highly integrated courses with case-based learning and integrating the experiential learning of medical students regarding their medical knowledge, skills, and attitude, students can be guided to develop self-awareness and achieve self-regulated learning, which can enhance their confidence in clinical competency.
The purpose of educational reforms is to establish students' competencies in addressing future challenges. The PGY program in Taiwan was analyzed using the six core competencies defined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education as the longitudinal index for assessing contemporary physicians before and after their graduation [22] . These competencies should be adjusted and then incorporated into the longitudinal education fostering system. In response to the underpinning objectives of the curriculum, the innovative teaching activities should benefit medical students in improving their learning outcomes and be examined regularly to evaluate the effectiveness [23] .
Evidently, since 2013, an objective structured clinical examination has been incorporated as a prerequisite component into the second part of the national certification examination of physician in Taiwan. This nationwide standardized examination is aimed at testing the core competencies of medical students. Furthermore, every 3-6 years, Taiwan Medical Accreditation Council conducts on-site visits to all medical schools and assesses the learning effectiveness of various teaching methods developed at four levels: The university, department, teachers, and students. Subsequently, the Joint Commission of Taiwan hosts the PGY training program for medical students, achieving a competency-based continuing education system for training prospective physicians on clinical care [24] .
In Taiwan's higher education environment, only the top 1300 high school students are qualified for enrolment in medical schools. However, the previous time-based educational approach requires 12 years for students to mature as an attending physician. The old program could not sustain the considerable global change in digitization and the globalization of finance and logistics. The WFME analyzed contemporary global medical trends and suggested that a medical professional in the 21 st century should demonstrate nine standards for basic medical education, which are consistent with the aforementioned six core competencies of physicians. Those movement of standards should be student-activated instruction, prioritize patients with good communication, student influence on program development and cultivating medical leadership, emphasize the provision of high-quality medical care to patients through self-regulated learning, aboard and distant learning assist with technology and utilization of skills laboratory [6] . In the following discussion, we pointed out educational strategies to bridge the gap of educational reforms.
Peter S. Temes emphasizes that the following three aspects should be considered in education reform: Keeping it real, making it new, besides, recruiting and retaining the right teacher [25] . Strategies and practices in education reform that are established on the basis of a realistic understanding fulfil 
The experiencing course of to-be a physician was arranged in Year 2, according to National Cheng Kung University, Tzu Chi University and Kaohsiung Medical University the philosophy of ""education is life itself."" The changes in Taiwan's 6-year medical education program are outlined as follows: Shortening the education period and thus enabling medical students to receive clinical training earlier; helping medical students to engage in the PGY as qualified physicians in clinical practice; and developing comprehensive core competencies for physicians. This ""learning-by-doing"" in the workplace is consistent with Dewey's perspective [26] . The essential elements of Dewey's perspective include evoking students' intrinsic curiosity, which might subsequently be transformed into active motivation for learning continuously; cultivating problem-solving and task-achievement abilities by using project-based learning; and transforming classrooms into laboratories and encouraging students to engage in lifelong learning. The key factor still underlines clinical teachers' guidance throughout the learning process, the transformation of medical knowledge into practical skills, and management of clinical tasks, all of which closely match the concept of CBME and outcome-based education. The bottom-up reform of the medical education program and the top-down reform of the education program led by medical educators would complement each other only when teachers are given autonomy in teaching activity.
As mentioned, the formal curriculum is transformed using new teaching methods and medical humanity is emphasized in the new medical education program [ Table 2 ] [19, 27, 28] . Thus, the 6-year medical education program creates a complete learning environment using an innovative curriculum design that combines a formal curriculum, an informal curriculum, and a hidden curriculum (i.e., making it new). Several examples of curriculum design are presented as follows. In Chung Shan Medical University in Taiwan, a flipped teaching method is applied in the anesthesiology course; this enables students to learn at their own pace and thus improve their professional competencies and engage in self-directed learning by engaging in pre-class preparations and using the interactive online teaching platform Zuvio in the class [29] . Several institutions have also applied a hidden curriculum. For example, Tzu Chi University in Taiwan has implemented a silent mentor program aimed at cultivating the spirit of service in students [28] . National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan has implemented an on-doctoring program that emphasizes the cultivation of human-centered thinking and lifelong learning in students [30] . Furthermore, the Miharashi medical service team in Tzu Chi University has, since 2006, taught students about serving others by arranging visits to indigenous tribes [31] . Such visits enable students to perceive health needs from residents of remote areas in eastern Taiwan and consequently inspire students to respect life and engage in self-reflection. Harden proposed SPICE model to design curriculum during implement of educational reform strategies [32] . Educators thus use problem-based methods to evaluate a community's needs and provide learner-centered courses for creating a comprehensive and systematic learning environment. However, numerous teachers and parents have raised concerns about the practical processes of an informal curriculum and a hidden curriculum in Taiwan.
Teachers play a key role in the implementation of new teaching methods. The literature review revealed that the effectiveness of flipped teaching depends on learners' compliance and the established learning space [33, 34] . Thus, several issues with the implementation of the teaching strategies in the new medical education program involve recruiting and retaining the right teachers and defining the required teaching abilities of clinical teachers in medical schools [23] . Harris advocated that medical teachers can refine themselves by not only advancing in the medical profession but also enhancing their teaching skills and general competencies in the contemporary medical system. These problems might also occur in the new education program. An example of such problems is as follows: Determining how existing clinical teachers under the old system can understand the basic competencies defined in the 6-year medical education and how they can adapt instruction methods to attain learners' competencies and allocate educational resource according to various teaching objectives effectively. A disruptive education environment might impose a burden on clinical physicians and result in patient dissatisfaction.
These problems inherently pertain to quality improvement in faculty development and in human resources. Prof. Huang analyzed problems in the quota of full-time teachers in medical schools in Taiwan and suggested that the full potential of such teachers' passion and skills for teaching was not raised [5] . In addition, universities and schools face difficulties in supervising clinical teachers, and this leads to reduced teaching quality. A necessary reform depends upon bringing together around common goals all of the key players in the organization, regulation and conduct of medical education, taking an example as Emory School of Medicine in the US [35] . Regarding the recruitment of teachers in medical schools, we suggest the following changes: Stakeholders establishing recruitment standards that are based on teaching performance instead of research publications, which were emphasized in previous educational program; adoption of teaching experience and faculty's competencies as the basis for determining the number of courses the teacher should undertake; implementation of teacher evaluation to prevent senior faculty from passing on most of their courses to junior members in order to ease their own burden; supervisors inspecting in-service teachers' performance in lifelong learning and passion for teaching, moreover, developing innovative teaching activities; the educational institutes providing supplementary and enabling training courses for unqualified teachers to receive credit for faculty development and fulfil teaching obligation in medical education.
Proponents of education reform advocate the transformation of clinical learning environment, but the center of the medical program, the patient, is ignored during the exercise of the reform. Physicians' abilities are actually judged by patients in the clinical setting. When patients encounter novice graduates, who are considered to be adequately capable by medical schools, they cannot distinguish physicians from the new and the old program. Therefore, clinical personnel may shoulder any response and conflicts in the clinic during the transition of two educational programs. The burden imposed on physicians who also serve as clinical teachers is heavier than ever. To bridge the gap between the new and old medical education programs, clinical faculty must adhere to the essential goals of education, share clinical, and teaching responsibilities with each other. Proponents of education reform must remain committed to the principle of prioritizing the interests of patients, regardless of the corporatization of universities and the unspoken pressure from authority.
In 2019, the first class of medical students subjected to the 6-year local medical education program will enter the workplace. They have been taught using innovative teaching methods accompanied by a CBME framework; hence, they have faced diverse assessment and gained novel learning experiences. Nevertheless, to fill the education gap in the era of the reform, the industry, government, and academia have devoted efforts to improve policies and modify the integrated courses of liberalism and basic clinical medicine. Various challenges are encountered in the clinical environment, which contains the most learning opportunities. We believe that the medical teams may be exhausted if students graduating from the new education program are designated as PGY before their confidence and professional capabilities in practicing clinical tasks independently are confirmed. In addition, concerns raised in the medical environment might restrict the professional development of medical students graduating from the new program. Finally, medical schools should focus on the systematic development of clinical teachers, provide lifelong training programs for teachers, emphasize the protection of patients' rights, and at the same time, the development of medical personnel's comprehensive profession in clinical environment continuously.

Objective: This study was conducted to investigate different respiratory diseases in broiler and sonali birds in some selected districts of Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: We were collected a total of 460 blood samples from 46 farms with 36 broiler farms and 10 sonali farms (cross-breed) from 2015 to 2017. All the collected serum samples were tested for determining specific antibodies of avian rhinotracheitis (ART) virus, infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) virus, infectious bronchitis (IBV) virus, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) infection using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results: The overall seropositivity was highest in ORT (45.9%), followed by IBV (37.6%), ART (2.6%), and ILT (0.4%). Out of 360 broiler samples, highest seropositivity was recorded in ORT (43.3%) and lowest in IBV (31.4%). Surprisingly, no broiler samples were found positive for ART and ILT. In case of sonali, the seropositivity was highest in IBV (60%) and lowest in ILT (2%). With respect to types of birds and age groups, the seropositive percentage of all four pathogens was found higher in sonali than broiler. Between two age groups of sonali, the seropositive percentage of ART (12%), ORT (55%), ILT (2%), and IBV (60%) was highest at 21-60 weeks of age compared to 5-20 weeks of age. However, based on location, the seropositive of ORT and IBV was highest in Jamalpur (63.3%) and Fulbariya and Trishal (50%) and lowest in Sreepur (16.7%) and Jamalpur (3.3%). Conclusion: The four pathogens are ubiquitous in nature for the sonali chickens, and the prevalence of ORT and IBV was the most prevalent viruses in the study areas. This study indicates a need for improved surveillance and characterization of ORT and ART circulating in all types of poultry in Bangladesh.
ARTICLE HISTORY","The poultry industry is an important subsector of agriculture, has generated huge employment opportunity, increases the supply of good quality protein, ensured food security, involved in country's economic growth and reduced poverty level in both urban and rural areas of Bangladesh [1, 2] . There are several constraints that hinder the development process in poultry sector; among them, disease is the major one. Various pathogens, such as bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, etc., are responsible for causing diseases in poultry and they attack their different body systems [3] . Respiratory tract, an important part of poultry body system, frequently affected by pathogens causing respiratory diseases [4] . Several pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and environmental factors initiate the respiratory diseases of chicken. Viral and bacterial pathogens are responsible for causing most of the respiratory diseases, namely, avian rhinotracheitis (ART), infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Licence (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/4.0) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), etc., that lead to huge economic losses in poultry industry [5] . Bacterial pathogens colonize the respiratory system after primarily introducing of viral or environmental stress for pathogens [6] .
ART virus is also known as avian pneumovirus (APV), important respiratory viral disease affecting both chickens and turkeys [7] . ART was first identified in Bangladesh at 2016 by Ali et al. [8] in broiler breeder, layer, and Sonali chicken (cross-breed between Rhode Island Red cocks and Fayoumi hens). Sneezing, depression, coughing tracheal rales, swollen infraorbital sinus, ocular and nasal discharges, and foamy conjunctivitis are the major signs associated with the disease [9] . This virus also causes swollen-head syndrome in broiler breeders and broiler [10] and dropped egg production in layers [11] . ORT, another important bacterial pathogen, belonging to the super family of RNA containing bacteria causes respiratory infections and affects air sac [12] . It has been reported throughout the world except Bangladesh and mainly affect in turkey and chickens but other species can often be infected with this pathogen [13] . This can act as primary or secondary agents depending on immune status, environmental factors, and pathogenicity of related strain and also the presence of other pathogens [14] . ILT virus, an important virus, causes respiratory infection in birds belonging to the family Herpesviridae. Thus, virus mainly affects the chickens and characterizes by sneezing, nasal discharge, swollen infraorbital, and nasal sinuses and sometime affects eye leads to conjunctivitis [15] . The disease more frequently occurs in the areas of intensive poultry production and outbreak causes' high economic loss as it increases mortality, reduces egg production, and declines growth rates [16] . Another important viral pathogens responsible for respiratory disease, namely, Avian IBV belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family [17] . It can affect chickens of all ages, and primarily it replicates in respiratory tract, and later, it can move to epithelial cells gut, oviduct, and kidney, results decreased egg production and growth performance and sometimes attract other pathogens [18] . So far, it has been reported in chickens, turkey, pigeon, pheasant, Guinea fowl, and peafowl [17] .
Despite the country with a large number of poultry farms, only a few reports are available in Bangladesh regarding respiratory infections. A few works have been done on IBV [19] and ILT [15, 20, 21] , but the amount is quite scanty. In view of this, the present research work was conducted to perform a comparative serological study to check the presence of several viral and bacterial pathogens antibodies in chickens with special emphasis on ART, ILT, IBV, and ORT, as well as to determine the distribution of its specific antibody in respect of the types of birds (broiler and sonali), age groups, and locations of farms of different districts of Bangladesh.
We were collected a total of 460 blood samples from broiler and sonali chickens located at four different districts, namely, Mymensingh, Gazipur, Jamalpur, and Bogura of Bangladesh. For broiler samples, six upazilas were selected where four upazilas (Muktagacha, Fulbariya, Trishal, and Valuka) from Mymensingh and one upazila from each Gazipur (Sreepur) and Jamalpur (Jamalpur sadar) districts, and a total of 360 blood samples comprising 60 from six farms of each upazilas were collected. All the sonali blood samples (100) were collected from ten farms of Bogura sadar upazilas of Bogura district, and each farm shared 10 samples. All the selected broiler and sonali farms had a history of respiratory problems and had not been vaccinated against the studied pathogens. During the sample collection, types (broiler and sonali), age of birds, and locations were recorded.
Approximately, 2-3 ml blood was collected from the wing vein of randomly selected birds showing respiratory signs for 2 weeks using 3 ml disposable syringe. The syringe containing blood was kept in standing position for clot formation, and serum was harvested by decanting method as described by Barberis et al. [22] . Later, the collected serum was taken to an eppendorf tube and transferred to laboratory maintaining cool chain and subjected to centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 5 min for removing the remaining clots, insoluble materials, and red blood cells. Finally, the cleared serum samples were stored at −20°C until performing the test.
Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (ELISA) was done to analyze the serum samples. Commercially available ELISA kits (BioChek®, Reeuwijk, Netherlands) of ART, ORT, ILT, and IBV were used to detect the antibodies. Serum samples were diluted at 1:50 dilution in dilution buffer, followed by 1:10 dilution, and final dilution of 1:500 was used as working samples for respective ELISA. 100 μl of negative and positive controls was added into antibody coated plate wells A1, B1 and C1, D1, respectively, remaining 92 wells were filled with samples. After that, plate incubated at room temperature for 30 min in case of IBV and 60 min in case of ART, ORT, and ILT. Meanwhile, conjugate and wash solutions were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. After incubation, contents of wells were aspirated and washed four times with wash buffer (350 μl). Then, the plate was inverted and tapped firmly on absorbent paper to remove the moisture. Then, 100 μl conjugate reagents were added on each well. Again, the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in case of IBV and 60 min in case of ART, ORT, and ILT, respectively. After incubation, washed the plate with wash buffer following the procedure described previously. Then, the wells of microtiter plate were filled with substrate and incubated for 15 min at 22°C-27°C in case of IBV and 30 min for ART, ORT, and ILT. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl stop solutions. Finally, the optical density value of each sample was measured at 405 nm within 15 min after adding stop solution, and the results were recorded by calculating sample to positive (S/P) ratio and antibody titer.
For each sample, S/P ratio and antibody titer were calculated using the following formulas.
For S/P ratio 
All the data were incorporated in SPSS (version 25) [23] , and descriptive studies were performed for determining the association among different variable using Chi-square test.
In this study, 460 serum samples collected from broiler and sonali were tested against three viruses and one bacterium using indirect ELISA. Among the pathogens, overall seropositivity was highest in ORT (45.9%) and lowest in ILT (0.4%) viruses. Out of 360 broiler samples, highest seropositivity was recorded in ORT (43.3%) followed by IBV (31.4%). Interestingly, no broiler samples were found positive for ART and ILT viruses. Among 100 sonali samples, highest number of seropositivity was found in IBV (60%) followed by ORT (55%), ART (12%), and ILT (2%), respectively. Compared to broiler, the seropositive percentage was higher in sonali. The seropositive difference among the four agents between broiler and sonali birds was found statistically significant (p < 0.05) ( Table 1) .
In this study, serum samples were collected from two age groups, in case of broiler age was ranged from 3 to 4 weeks, and sonali age was varied from 5 to 40 weeks. The seropositive percentages regarding age groups were as similar as types of birds mentioned in Table 1 . In case of sonali birds, samples were categorized into two age groups where 40 samples were collected from 5 to 20 weeks age group and 60 samples were from 21 to 40 weeks age group. The seropositive samples were significantly higher in 21-40 weeks age group compared to 5-20 weeks ( Table 2) .
The serological results of different respiratory diseases based on locations are shown in Table 3 . In broiler chicken, it was observed that ORT and IBV were highly prevalent in all study upazila areas, and the highest seropositive of ORT was observed in Jamalpur (63.3%) followed by Trishal (56.7%), Fulbariya (55%), Muktagacha (40%), Valuka (28.3%), and Sreepur (16.7%), respectively. Similarly IBV was observed highest in Fulbariya (50%) and Trishal (50%) followed by Muktagacha (31.7%), Valuka (30%), Sreepur (23.3%), and Jamalpur (2%), respectively. On the other hand, no broiler serum samples of all six study upazilas were found positive for ART and ILT viruses. The difference of ORT and IBV based on location was found statistically significant (p < 0.05). In case of sonali, they were found to be seropositive for all the tested respiratory diseases with highest seroprevalence in IBV (60%) and lowest in ILT (2%).
This study was conducted to investigate different respiratory diseases in broiler and layer through indirect ELISA. The results showed that overall seropositive percentage of ART, ORT, ILT, and IBV viruses was 2.6%, 45.9%, 0.4%, and 37.6%, respectively. Compared to broiler, the seropositive was found more in sonali chicken. Interestingly, no samples were found positive against ART virus in case of broiler but 12% were recorded in sonali birds. The past seroprevalence study of ART in Bangladesh found overall 53.29% chickens including 35.57% sonali and 50.85% layer chickens [8] . On the contrary, Sharma et al. [24] found the higher number of ART positive sample 31.7% in broiler flocks in Grenada, West Indies. A higher rate of seropositivity in the later study was observed as this area had the highest density of broiler flocks. Detection of ART antibodies, which is also known as APV, in broiler was negative compared to sonali birds (0% vs. 12%), this higher positive results in sonali to broiler might be due to the life span, that longer life span may allow the sonali birds to develop stronger immunity against the virus detected [24] . In Egypt, similar study was carried out by Nagy et al. [10] reported 21.7% ART seropositive broiler samples. Another reason of lower seropositive in this study may be due to the fact that infected chicken may not necessarily produce humoral antibodies or antibodies may be at very low levels at the time of the sampling [25] . In this study, the seropositive percentage of ORT was higher in both broiler and sonali birds (43.3% and 55%), which is in agreement with the results of Mehrabanpour et al. [13] who has reported 42.5% seropositivity of ORT in broiler chickens in Fars province, Iran and also in agreement with the findings of Ghanbarpour and Salehi [26] for large broiler flock who reported 42.9% seropositivity of ORT in Kermanshah province, west Iran. In addition, comparatively higher or lower seropositivity of ORT in broiler was reported in different parts of the world [12, 27] . The difference among different studies might be due to variation in geo-climatic condition, age and exposure of weather which might contribute to variable prevalence of respiratory diseases [13] .
In this study, entire 360 broiler serum samples were found negative for ILT virus but 2% sample was positive for sonali birds. It was previously reported that layer chickens are mostly associated with ILT infection in Bangladesh [15] . Another study in Gazipur district in Bangladesh reported 81.47% ILT seropositive in layer chicken [20] . The higher seropositivity in layer chicken might be that the disease is more prevalent in older age than young. Lower findings of ILT in this study might be due to the samples collected from broiler, and sonali had not been exposed by the virus previously [20] . A total of 460 serum samples were collected from sonali and broiler chickens. In this study, the overall seropositive of IBV was found to be 37.6%, of which 60% from sonali and 31.4% from broiler. Similar findings were previously reported where 71.83% and 23.82% of IBV from Sonali and broiler chickens in Bangladesh were found [19] , while a higher seropositive of 54% of IBV from local chickens was recorded in Ghana [18] . Lower seropositive rates ranging from 17.52% to 21.2% of IBV from broiler and local chickens were reported from other geographical areas [28] [29] [30] [31] . The differences in IBV seropositive might be linked with biosecurity, management practices, vaccination status, and environmental factors.
Age factor also has significance influence to the occurrence of respiratory diseases in birds. In this study, higher aged group chickens were most susceptible to respiratory diseases. ART specific antibodies were found higher in Sonali at 21-40 weeks of age, which supports the findings of Rahimi [32] who reported 48.1% and 93.2% of ART in broiler of 6-8 weeks of age and broiler breeder of 56-72 weeks of age, respectively. With respect to age, the seropositive of ORT in broiler and sonali was higher in later age. Allymehr [33] and Mousavi et al. [14] reported 44.2% and 55.6% of ORT seropositive in broiler flock at 40-45 days of age, which are in agreement with the current study. Similar findings were also observed in some other studies of different parts of the world [34] [35] [36] . In addition, ILT was recorded only in sonali chicken at 21-40 weeks of age, which was lower than several previous findings [27, 37, 38] . On the contrary, IBV was found in both broiler and sonali chickens but higher at later ages. The current findings are resembled with various previous results [39] [40] [41] . Maternally derived antibody remains up to 2 weeks of age, and subsequently, it decreases up to 7 weeks of age. But, during this period, chickens are susceptible to IBV if no vaccine is given against IBV to the broiler flock, and no biosecurity is maintained in the chicken farm.
From the above findings, it may be concluded that the percentage of ORT and IBV in broiler and sonali birds is higher than remaining two pathogens (ART and ILT). In Bangladesh, infectious bronchitis causes a great deal of economic losses through poor weight gain and production drop. High seropositive was found for ORT that indicates ubiquitous presence of the organism in study areas. As there is no vaccination practiced for ORT, it indicates that a larger portion of poultry flock is experiencing new field infection. Further investigation could be done to know the molecular characteristics and surveillance of the four respiratory diseases.",Seroprevalence of major avian respiratory diseases in broiler and sonali chicken in selected areas of Bangladesh,"Bhuiyan, Zafar Ahmed; Ali, Md Zulfekar; Moula, Mohammad Moktader; Bary, Md Akramul; Arefin, Nishat; Giasuddin, Md; Khan, Zahed Uddin Mahmood",J Adv Vet Anim Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882717/,322,2493,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,28698e9d58d0b455cfa1adb28be25bc7f9286859,"Viruses from the Filoviridae family, as many other virus families, require an acidic pH for successful infection and are therefore susceptible to the actions of 4-aminoquinolines, such as chloroquine.
Although the mechanisms of action of chloroquine clearly indicate that it might inhibit filoviral infections, several clinical trials that attempted to use chloroquine in the treatment of other acute viral infectionsincluding dengue and influenza A and Bcaused by low pH-dependent viruses, have reported that chloroquine had no clinical efficacy, and these results demoted chloroquine from the potential treatments for other virus families requiring low pH for infectivity.
The present review is aimed at investigating whether chloroquine could combat the present Ebola virus epidemic, and also at exploring the main reasons for the reported lack of efficacy. Literature was sourced from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, reference list of articles and textbooks -Fields Virology (Volumes 1and 2), the cytokine handbook, Pharmacology in Medicine: Principles and Practice, and hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy.
The present analysis concludes that (1) chloroquine might find a place in the treatment of Ebola, either as a monotherapy or in combination therapies; (2) the ineffectiveness of chloroquine, or its analogue, hydroxychloroquine, at treating infections from low pH-dependent viruses is a result of the failure to attain and sustain a steady state concentration sufficient to increase and keep the pH of the acidic organelles to approximately neutral levels; (3) to successfully treat filoviral infectionsor other viral infections that emerge or emerged from low pH-dependent virusesa steady state chloroquine plasma concentration of at least 1 μg/mL(~3.125 μM/L) or a whole blood concentration of 16 μM/L must be achieved and be sustained until the patients' viraemia becomes undetectable. These concentrations, however, do not rule out the efficacy of other, higher, steady state concentrationsalthough such concentrations might be accompanied by severe adverse effects or toxicities. The feasibility of the conclusion in the preceding texts has recently been supported by a subsequent study that shows that amodiaquine, a derivative of CQ, is able to protect humans infected with Ebola from death.","The Filoviridae familycontaining Ebola and Marburg viruses comprises enveloped viruses with nonsegmented, negativesense RNA genomes, 1-3 each of which consists of seven genes forming the structural and nonstructural proteins. 1, 2 Of all filoviruses, the currently circulating Zaire species of Ebola virus (EboV) is the most virulent, with a mortality rate ranging from 59 to 88%. 1, 2 The peplomers of the EboV species are composed of trimerized heterodimers of glycoproteins 1 and 2, which are heavily glycosylated with both N-linked and O-linked glycans, and contain abundant α(2-6) and/or α(2-3) linked sialic acids. [1] [2] [3] These peplomers have broad tropism for a variety of host cells and organs as a result of their ability to bind either specifically or nonspecifically to various cell surface molecules. 1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] However, despite this broad tropism, infection by filoviruses greatly depends on the acidic pH of the organelles internalizing the virus, 1, 2, [8] [9] [10] and therefore this characteristic can be exploited therapeutically.
Filovirus binding to surface molecules on the plasma membrane of susceptible cellssuch as tissue macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells and hepatocytesleads to the internalization of virions into vesicles which traffic through the endosomal pathway. 1, 2, [8] [9] [10] To successfully infect susceptible cells, the virus requires endosomal acidification and the cleavage of the glycoprotein 1 segment of the peplomer by host endosomal proteases (active in acidic pH) 1,2,8-10 and, without this acidification and cleavage, the infection is abrogated. 1,2,10 Therefore, therapeutic agents targeting endosomal acidification (and hence pH-dependent proteases), could be beneficial in combating the present African EboV epidemic.
Successful infection induces the local and systemic release of varying amounts of cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and other mediators, 1, 2, [11] [12] [13] [14] and eventually results in generalized cell death. 1, 2, [11] [12] [13] If a patient's immune system is able to control the infection, the patient recovers 1,2,11-14although convalescence is prolonged, and recovering patients have been shown to produce infectious virus many months after symptoms have disappeared. 1,2 However, if a patient's immune system is unable to control the infection, further cycles of infection in susceptible cells and organs occur, leading to further release of the mediators mentioned in the preceding texts, with consequently massive cell death. 1, 2, [11] [12] [13] This is manifested in fatal cases as extensive cell death in many organsincluding the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney and adrenal glandsand coagulopathies, which are revealed as disseminated intravascular coagulation, haemorrhages, petechiae, ecchymosis, congestion and uncontrolled bleeding at venipuncture sites. 1, 2, [11] [12] [13] The mode of infection of filoviruses and the associated pathologies may uncover an Achilles' heel to a therapeutic weaponry based on 4-aminoquinolines such as chloroquine (CQ).
Therapeutically exploiting the tropism of chloroquine for the acidic organelles in the treatment of filoviral infections Chloroquine is a weak base, commonly used in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] It is readily absorbed when administered by either oral or parenteral routes, 15-23 becoming highly concentrated in tissues such as the adrenal glands, liver, spleen and kidney [15] [16] [17] [18] 23 tissues suffering extensive necrosis in fatal filoviral infections. 1, 2, 4 In the cells of these and other tissues, CQ becomes concentrated in acidic organelles such as the endosomes, lysosomes and Golgi vesicles, [16] [17] [18] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] thereby increasing their pH [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] 31 and leading to the dysfunction of several enzymes, e.g. those required for the proteolytic processing and the post-translational modification of proteins. 10, 24, 25, 27, [31] [32] [33] [34] CQ also inhibits the production of several immunological mediators, the excessive release of which contributes to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. 18, 24 Therefore, these CQ properties should be considered in the treatment for filoviral infections and their associated pathologies.
The CQ-increased pH of the acidic organelles has been shown to inhibit several virusesincluding influenza A and B, SARS coronavirus, hepatitis A virus and the Borna disease viruswhich all require a low pH for entry. 24, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] This suggests that CQ could also inhibit filoviruses' entry into the cytoplasm of susceptible cells and thereby abrogate their infection, since this is dependent on endosomal acidification and the activities of several host endosomal proteases. CQ might also inhibit the assembly and budding of filoviruseswhich partly require the late endosome in their assembly. 1, 2 Accordingly, the dysfunction of enzymes, e.g. some glycosyltransferases, caused by CQ or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as a direct result of the increased pH and/or structural changes in the Golgi apparatus, has been shown to inhibit not only the glycosylation of SARS coronavirus, 34 but also that of HIV-1 gp120, thereby leading to the production of noninfectious virions or virus with decreased infectivity. 31, 33, 40, 41 This mechanism has been invoked to explain the decrease in viral load that was observed when patients with HIV-1 were orally administered HCQ at 800 mg/day for 8 weeks. 31, 42 These results, though obtained with nonrelated viruses, could suggest that CQ, if given at the correct dosage, might inhibit the glycosylation of EboV peplomers, which is more pronounced than that occurring with HIV-1. [1] [2] [3] 43 Since the GP of filoviruses is the only protein involved in initiating infection, 1,2,5,6,8 and cytotoxicity is dependent on its expression, 1,2,5 inhibiting its glycosylation could potentially (1) inhibit EboV tropism for a broad variety of host cells and organs; (2) lead to the production of noninfectious or decreased infectivity virus (as seen with HIV-1) 31,33 ; and (3) decrease Ebov pathogenicity. Impaired glycosylation could therefore save time for the adaptive immune response, which normally fails in fatal cases, 1,2,11 to be established and deal with the infection.
Therapeutically exploiting the immunomodulatory properties of chloroquine in the treatment of filoviral infections Apart from therapeutically exploiting the increased pH and dysfunction of enzymes caused by CQ, the immunomodulatory properties of this drug could also be exploited therapeutically in the treatment of some of filoviral infection-associated pathologies. Several studies have suggested that the multiple organ failure and hypovolemic shock seen in fatal cases are likely a result of both direct infection and destruction of susceptible cells, such as endothelial cells, and the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators released from infected and activated cells, such as monocytes and macrophages. 1, 2, 4, 6, [10] [11] [12] 44 One cytokine strongly implicated in these pathologies is TNF-α, 1, 2, 7, 12, 13 which is able to increase the permeability of endothelial cells, as shown in experiments conducted with the human umbilical vein. 1, 2, 7 It is also ablein humans injected with a recombinant formto induce a sustained activation of blood coagulation and also cause tissue injury and shock. [45] [46] [47] The role of TNF-α in the pathologies and fatalities associated with filoviral infections is further confirmed by the fact that (1) intramuscular administration of anti-TNF-α serum, after 4-7 days postinfection, is able to reduce the circulating concentration of TNF-α and protect 50% of infected rodents from death 1,2 ; (2) patients who recovered from infection with Zaire EboV (ZEboV) in two recent outbreaks in Gabon had a transient increase in the plasma concentration of TNF-α at the onset of infectionwhich then decreased during the course of the infection. Conversely, fatal cases display an increased and sustained concentration of TNF-α. 12 In these fatalities, highly increased concentrations of soluble tumour necrosis factor receptors were also detected. 12 Taken together, these observations clearly show that a therapeutic agent like CQ, which is able to prevent the activation of macrophages and also inhibit the secretion of TNF-α from various cells at clinically relevant concentrations, 24,48-52 could be of some benefit in the treatment of filoviral infections.
Another cytokine likely to be implicated in Ebola pathogenesisespecially the massive apoptosis or lymphopenia associated with fatal cases of EboV infectionsis IFN-γ. [11] [12] [13] It has been reported that IFN-γ is able to increase cellular sensitivity to apoptosis by upregulating the expression of Fas and Fas ligand, 53 and in all fatal cases of EboV infection, the expression of IFN-γ, Fas and Fas ligand was shown to be upregulated. 11 Another mechanism by which IFN-γ mightat least in partaccount for the massive apoptosis detected in Filovirus infections is induction of production by monocytes/macrophages of neopterin and its derivative, 7-8-dihydroneopterin. 12, 54 It has been reported that neopterin and 7-8-dihydroneopterin induce apoptosis in a rat alveolar cell line, 54 and that the plasma concentration of neopterin significantly and progressively increases throughout the disease course of all fatal cases of ZEboV infectionsbut not in survivors. 12 Therefore, the production of neopterin and 7-8-dihydroneopterin upon IFN-γ stimulation might also contribute to the massive apoptosis seen in fatal cases of EboV infections. [11] [12] [13] Thus, since the massive apoptosis seen in all fatal cases of EboV-infected patients is associated with the production of IFN-γ, neopterin and 7-8-dihydroneopterin, and TNF-α, 11-13 a therapeutic agent like CQ, having been shown, at clinically relevant concentrations, to inhibit the production of IFN-γ, TNF-α and neopterin from various cells, 24,48-52 could be of great benefit in the treatment of patients infected with the present ZEboV or other filoviruses.
Although the above mechanisms of the action of CQ and the various in vitro studies suggest that CQ may exert some benefit in infections from viruses that require an acidic pH for infectivity and/or are heavily glycosylated and evoke a detrimental immune activation, several clinical trials that attempted to use CQ or HCQ in the prevention or treatment of several viral infectionsincluding influenza A and B, HIV-1 and dengue viral infectionshave reported that CQ or HCQ either had undetectable/moderate clinical efficacy or were actually detrimental (Table 1) . 42, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] It is possible to hypothesize that these mixed or disappointing results may be attributable to not knowingand thus not achievingthe therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentration necessary for exerting its therapeutic effects (refer to the succeeding texts). In order for CQ to be used for the treatment of infections from viruses that require an acidic pH for infectivity and/or are heavily glycosylated and depend on their envelop glycoprotein for infectivity, the therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood concentration must be achieved and sustained until the patient's viraemia becomes undetectable. In the succeeding texts, I summarize some of the evidence that can be used to determine the necessary therapeutic, steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentration.
Firstly, several in vitro studies have shown that the optimal uptake of CQ in several cell types isolated from different animals is in the range of 10-20 μM, with concentrations >~30 μM, causing less uptake. 26, 30 Secondly, the whole blood CQ EC 50 of 17.7 μM/L is considered to be an in vivo threshold of CQ toxicity since it is a level associated with significant cardiovascular effects in patients with CQ poisoning, 67 whilst patients having concentrations of 16 μM/L were shown to have no significant cardiovascular events. 67 Thirdly, out of all the clinical trials summarized in Table 1 , only the trial that administered the highest HCQ dose, for a duration sufficient to attain a steady state (0.08 to 2.98 μM/L, mean = 0.94 μM/L), reported a moderate improvement in several of the patients. 42 Of all the patients, only the one with the highest HCQ level (2.98 μM/L) (which is approximately equivalent to the in vitro CQ EC 50 of~3 μM shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication 33 ) had the best response to HCQ. This patient's absolute CD4+ T-cells increased from 200 to 400 cells/mm 3 , the plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA decreased from 225 to 135 cpm, the percentage of CD4+ T-cells increased from 11% to 34%, and there was also a significant improvement in mitogen responses. 42 Although HIV does not depend on the acidic organelles for infectivity and is less glycosylated in comparison to EboV, [1] [2] [3] 43 HCQ, at this steady state concentration, is nevertheless able to inhibit HIV replication by affecting gp120 glycosylation. 31, 33, 42 Fourthly, the steady state CQ/HCQ concentrations of 1 μg/mL (~3.125 μM/L) and~16 μM/L detected in plasma and whole blood respectively, have been shown both in vivo and in vitro to inhibit viral replication and the overproduction of some immunological mediators associated with the pathologies of many viral infections and some autoimmune diseases. 22, 48, 64, [68] [69] [70] I conclude that (1) a 16 μM/L transient or steady state whole blood concentration of CQ most likely has no significant cardiovascular events 22,42,67-69 ; (2)~16 μM/L steady state whole blood concentration of CQ/HCQ is able to inhibit viral replication, glycosylation and the over production of some immunological mediators associated with some viral infections 22,33-35,38,39,42,64,67-70 ; (3) the optimal uptake of CQ in humans is likely to lie within the range of 10-20 μM/L. Therefore, such a steady state CQ concentration could be safe and sufficient to raise and maintain the acidic organelles' pH to a level approximately neutral, thereby inhibiting viral replication by mechanisms such as inhibition of endosomal proteases, inhibition of the fusion of viral membrane with host cells plasma membranes and inhibition of viral glycosylation.
In order to achieve the recommended therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentrations, the use of slow, continuous and constant IV infusion could be recommendable, since (1) it could be more efficient in achieving the stated therapeutic concentration and (2) it is more controlled, given the low cardiovascular safety margin of CQ. 18, 21 Having recommended the use of constant IV infusion, suggesting a precise dose and an infusion rate for filoviral infection treatment (as in the treatment of malaria), though seemingly reasonably, is, however, impossible at this stage. This is primarily because of the interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetics of CQ absorption. 69, 71 CONCLUSION I conclude that 1 μg/mL (~3.125 μM/L) or 16 μM/L steady state CQ concentration in plasma or whole blood respectively, could be used for the treatment of filoviral and other infections by viruses requiring an acidic pH for infectivity, and that these concentrations need to be sustained until the patients' viraemia becomes undetectable. These stated concentrations, however, do not rule out the efficacy of other, higher, steady state concentrationsthough such concentrations might be accompanied by severe adverse effects or toxicities. Other subsequent research has supported the conclusion in the preceding texts by confirming that a derivative of CQ has some protective effect against Ebola infection in humans. 72

142,d11a76dee8f03c0def1b8b254af658b685252588,"China's rapid and sustained economic growth offers an opportunity to ask whether the advantages of growth diffuse throughout an economy, or remain localized in areas where the growth has been the greatest. A critical policy area in China has been the health system, and health inequality has become an issue that has led the government to broaden national health insurance programs. This study investigates whether health system resources and performance have converged over the past 30 years across China's 31 provinces. To examine geographic variation of health system resources and performance at the provincial level, we measure the degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence in indicators of health system resources (structure), health services utilization (process), and outcome. All data are from officially published sources: the China Health Statistics Year Book and the China Statistics Year Book. Sigma convergence is found for resource indicators, whereas it is not observed for either process or outcome indicators, indicating that disparities only narrowed in health system resources. Beta convergence is found in most indicators, except for 2 procedure indicators, reflecting that provinces with poorer resources were catching up. Convergence found in this study probably reflects the mixed outcome of government input, and market forces. Thus, left alone, the equitable distribution of health care resources may not occur naturally during a period of economic growth. Governmental and societal efforts are needed to reduce geographic health variation and promote health equity.","In the last 30 years, China experienced high economic growth accompanied by a transition to a more marketoriented economy. The health system of China is also converting from a centrally planned health system to one that is more market oriented. 1 These transitions have resulted in an expanded supply of high-quality hospital services, especially to the people in large cities. Unfortunately, the majority of people in rural and poor areas are still having difficulties accessing good-quality and affordable health care. 2 Health inequality has become a major issue in the health system of China, which raises concerns among the general public and the government. 3 In China, health inequality at the individual level is reflected in health disparities between rural and urban areas and variation among provinces. The health disparity between urban and rural areas has been decreasing, but still exists. 4 Geographic health variation is also dramatic, but less studied. In 2005, Shanghai, the most affluent city in China, enjoyed 78 years' life expectancy at birth, which was the highest in China. However, the life expectancy at birth in the poorest province in Western China was only 65 years. 5 The extent of diffusion of the advantages of growth throughout the economy has not been rigorously studied. Our hypothesis is that over the 30 years' economic growth, geographic variation in health system resources and performance at the provincial level has decreased and is achieving convergence. The alternative hypothesis is that over the 30 years' economic growth, health resources and performance at the provincial level have increased, resulting in divergence.
Geographic variation in health is caused by multiple factors, such as the upstream unequal social determinants and the relationship between government and market in the health system. The health system itself also plays an independent and important role. The first question we will explore is the current extent of geographic variation in health system resources and performance. The next is how it has changed during the past 30 years in the face of the rapid, sustained economic growth.
Geographic variation in health system resources and performance can be analyzed with several methods. Small area variation studies have been widely used, especially with comparisons of health care expenditures (HCEs) in different regions; for example, the Dartmouth Atlas points out variations of expenditures as possible explanations of high health costs. The Dartmouth researchers have also presented simulations that suggest that the cost savings would be huge if high-cost regions could, somehow, reduce their costs to those of low-cost regions. 6 Convergence analysis is another method to study geographic variation. Convergence analysis does not focus on the difference between specific areas, but looks at the time trend of variation reduction in HCEs, or other health indicators. Triggered by the seminal articles by Barro and Sala-i-Martin and Mankiw et al, a huge amount of convergence literature emerged in various contexts, mainly to study patterns of economic growth across different regional economies. [7] [8] [9] Health economists have also adopted convergence analysis to measure health variation within and between regions. The convergence of HCEs has been studied in the European Union and the United States. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Limited publications have explored geographical variation in China at the provincial level or small-area level. Chou and Wang examined regional health expenditure inequality by testing 2 hypotheses on HCE convergence from 1978 to 2004. 15 According to their research, no single nationwide convergence was observed, but convergence in regional clusters was found. However, very few studies to date have looked at the geographic health variation longitudinally. We suspected that it may be related to the accessibility of geographic health data either at the provincial or small-area level.
In addition, quality of health services in China was rarely assessed according to Donabedian's typology of structure, process, and outcome, partly because of insufficient data on the process and outcome measures of health services. 16 Donabedian's typology has been widely used as a conceptual model for constructing indicator systems to assess the quality of care at the individual level as well as the performance of a health care system. We believe that the Donabedian way of categorizing health system performance is meaningful and useful from a policy perspective, and our study will apply convergence analysis to each category of health system performance to study the variation of China's health care at the provincial level.
The theory of welfare maximization under the usual condition of diminishing marginal product suggests that health resources at the margin should be allocated to those areas that are least well-off for aggregate welfare to be maximized. In other words, if health inequality within a country were to diminish, health indicators would converge with time and aggregate social welfare would be maximized.
One of simplest methods for estimating convergence is to calculate sigma convergence. Sigma is the standard deviation of the log transformed value of a variable. Therefore, sigma convergence occurs when the value of sigma falls over time among different provinces.
Sigma is calculated as follows: 
where y i,t is the value of a health indicator of province i at time t.
Beta convergence refers to a process in which poor regions grow faster than rich ones. For instance, in our study, beta convergence would suggest that the health care resources and performance had improved faster in poorer provinces than richer provinces in China. When all economies are assumed to converge toward the same steady state regardless of their specific features, beta convergence is said to be absolute. When the steady state may depend on features specific to each economy, beta convergence is then said to be conditional. Economists have acknowledged that beta convergence is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for sigma convergence. 7 In this study, the following model is used to test absolute beta convergence:
, ,
  is the growth rate per year from time t through time t + T, α is the intercept, and ε is the error item; β implies the presence of beta convergence. In our analysis, a negative and significant value for beta means the presence of beta convergence. The estimated value of beta also indicates the rate of convergence. Besides, the following model is used to test conditional beta convergence:
where X i,t represents the conditional variables including gross domestic product per capita, and population of province i at time t.
In this article, we first estimate the national convergence by calculating the sigma value of 7 health indicators. For 2 structure measures, we also estimate the regional conver- Besides, we also test both absolute and conditional beta convergences for all 7 health indicators.
Indicators at the provincial level are selected to measure health system performance according to Donabedian's typology. Seven health indicators are chosen according to the relevance, precision, and accessibility of the data. The definition and available years of data for each variable are listed in Table 1 . Structure indicators include beds per 1000 people and physicians per 1000 people. These two structure indicators reflect the direct input of resources available for the health system. Process indicators include outpatient visits, hospital admissions, bed occupancy rate, and average length of stay (LOS) in hospitals, reflecting the utilization of outpatient and inpatient services. Maternal mortality rate is the single outcome indicator in our analysis. Maternal mortality is an appropriate indicator to be included in the study because it has been the focus of China's health services system for many years. Other outcome measures such as infant mortality and life expectancy at birth would have been desirable to use as well, but these data are only collected in China's decennial census. Hence, they are excluded from the analysis as they are only reported in 3 years during the past 30 years.
All data are collected from the China Health Statistics Year Book and the China Statistics Year Book. 17, 18 We only include data of provinces and municipalities in mainland China, excluding data from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Macau Special Administrative Region, and Taiwan. It is notable that population data at the provincial level are based on the National Population Census of the People's Republic of China. Thus, the per capita data are calculated based on the actual population of long-term residents and migrants rather than the household registration system that excluded migrants. Thus, a large number of migrant workers and their family members who are not registered in the local household registration system are still counted as local residents in the population census data.
Results of the sigma convergence analysis are mixed. Sigma convergence is found for the structure indicators, but not for either the process indicators or the outcome indicator. At the same time, beta convergence is found in most chosen indicators, except for 2 process indicators (outpatient visits and hospital admissions).
The tested sigma value for physicians per thousand people fell from 1982 to 2010, confirming the trend of convergence of this indicator. Sigma fell sharply in the 1980s and 
1990s, whereas after 2000, the falling trend is ambiguous (see Figure 1 ). The falling sigma value indicates that provincial mean levels of physicians per thousand people became closer to each other from 1980s to 2000 (see Figure 2 ). For beds per thousand people, no convergence is observed in the 1980s. Weak convergence in the 1990s is found, whereas convergence after 2003 is seen (see Figure 3 ). Further study on the mean number of beds per thousand people at the provincial level probably explains the trends described above (see Figure 4 ). Average beds per thousand people in Eastern China, Central China, and Western China were all below 2.5 in the early 1980s. From then on, the number of beds in Eastern China increased steadily in the 1980s and stayed almost stable in the late 1990s. However, in Central China and Western China, bed supply increased slightly in the 1980s and early 1990s. But from the late 1990s to 2003, beds per thousand people in Central China and Western China decreased. After 2003, all 3 regions experienced a sharp increase in average number of beds. In other words, the gap between Eastern China and the other 2 regions widened from the 1980s, reducing convergence.
Provincial data for outpatient visits, hospital admissions, bed occupancy rates, and maternal mortality rate are only available for less than 10 years. Sigma divergence is found for bed occupancy rates. As for average LOS in hospital, the tested sigma value rose in 1980s, fluctuated in the 1990s, and fell after 2000. The sigma values for the other 3 indicators fluctuated within the past 10 years.
Sigma convergence within each region (Eastern China, Central China, and Western China) is also tested. Different patterns of convergence are found within different regions. For physicians per thousand people, although nationwide sigma convergence is found, sigma convergence is not observed within all regions. Western China showed no sigma convergence for physicians/1000 people during the past 28 years. In Central China, sigma convergence is only observed after 2000. In Eastern China, sigma convergence is found from the 1980s. These results indicate that within Central China and Western China, variation in human resources did not decrease along with the economic growth, but in the Eastern China, convergence in human resources input accompanied overall economic growth. As for beds/1000, sigma convergence only occurred within Western China from the 1980s to 2010. In Central China, convergence on beds/1000 occurred from 1990, whereas in Eastern China, sigma convergence is only observed after 2000. Such differences might be due to unequal input of structure resources.
Beta convergence has been found in most chosen indicators, except for outpatient visits and hospital admissions (see Table 2 ). The estimated beta values indicate the speed of convergence. In general, process and outcome indicators converged much faster than structure indicators. Without adjusting for GDP per capita and provincial population, bed occupancy rates converged at a rate of 7.5% yearly, average LOS in hospitals converged at a rate of 3.9% yearly, maternal mortality rate converged at a rate of 4.9% yearly, and beds per 1000 people and physicians per 1000 people only converged at a rate of 1.1% and 1.7% each year, respectively.
All provinces in China have experienced striking monotonic economic growth over the past 30 years. However, sustained economic growth does not necessarily have equal impact on the structure, process, and outcome of the health system. Sigma convergence is found for resources across the provinces of China during the long study period, but consistent results are not observed for indicators of process and outcome. At the same time, beta convergence is observed in 5 out of 7 health indicators, except for outpatient visits and hospital admissions.
In our study, sigma convergence is found in 2 structure indicators, physicians/1000 and beds/1000, implying the narrowing gap of resource distribution. Such results are consistent with studies that used Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, and the Theil index to describe the geographic distribution of health resources in China. 19 Convergence could emerge when provinces with lower per capita resources caught up with provinces with higher per capita resources, or when provinces with higher per capita resources declined to the level of provinces with lower per capita resources. The tested beta convergence in structure indicators suggests that provinces with lower per capita resources and worse performance were catching up.
The underlying drivers of resource distribution in China during the past 30 years are both market forces and government power. In China, health care is mainly financed by government investment, public health insurances, and outof-pocket fees. The majority of government investments are from local government, rather than central government. The scale of resource input largely depends on local economic conditions. 20 Public health insurance funds are also localized. However, provinces in China have had unequal economic development since 1980s, resulting in an uneven local financial capacity to pay for health services. For the indicator of beds/1000, the trends of sigma divergence in 1980s and 1990s could probably be explained by the imbalanced economic development among provinces. However, the obvious sigma convergence after 2000 probably represented the input from central government. The 2000 World Health Organization report on health system performance and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis pushed the central government to allocate resources toward public health services and health equity issues. Since then, the central government has expanded resource input dramatically to less developed areas in Central China and Western China to build and expand primary hospitals and public health facilities. 21 Such enormous investment from central government and local government might contribute to the sigma convergence of structure indicators as well as beta convergence in procedure and outcome indicators in recent years. For instance, China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme, a large government subsidized health insurance plan, has improved finances of township health centers since the start of its pilot program in 2003. 22 Moreover, in 2009, the Chinese government implemented an ambitious health reform that is aimed to build up basic health services system for all. 23 The success of these re-distributive measures on physicians per capita seems be more ambiguous than measured focused on beds.
The absence of constant sigma convergence in process and outcome indicators is probably the result of multiple factors. First, determinants outside the health system could influence the process and outcome indicators differently. Although the outcome indicator, maternal mortality rate, is very sensitive to health services performance, it is also influenced by many social and cultural factors. 24 Second, even if the gap in structure indicators was narrowed, changes in the process and outcome variables would lag and may take years to observe. And last but not least, the data availability has limited our ability to evaluate the convergence in process and outcome measures. It is notable that the absence of constant sigma convergence does not contradict the tested beta convergence, as beta convergence is not a sufficient condition for sigma convergence, which directly reflected the narrowed disparities.
Although our data are collected from officially published sources, the accuracy of the data at the provincial level is probably imperfect. One concern for the accuracy of aggregate data is patient mobility. In China, some people travel to seek better health care in other provinces. These people are not counted in the population data, as they are not local residents. However, these people usually only seek specialty care in tertiary hospitals, and thus should have little impact on the overall health indicators. Second, data for most process and outcome indicators are only available for less than 10 years, so it is difficult to determine the trend of sigma convergence during the relatively short period of time. In addition, we are aware that most health indicators in this article reflect the quantity of health resources and health service utilization, rather than the quality of care. However, available data for outcome measures are scarce. If longitudinal data at the provincial level are available, many broader outcome measures, such as all-cause mortality and causespecific mortality, should be interesting to study in the future.
Concerning health inequality in China, geographic variation of health system performance is examined at the provincial level. The degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence is measured for indicators of structure, process, and outcome of the health system. Sigma convergence is found in resource indicators like the number of physicians per thousand people, whereas it is not observed in process and outcome indicators. Beta convergence is found in most indicators, except for 2 procedure indicators. Thus, over the 30 years of economic growth, not all health indicators have achieved convergence, and when sigma convergence did occur in structure indicators, it is still uncertain whether real equity has been achieved. It represents a call for more central government resources allocated to resource-poor areas, and more efforts to promote health equity in the society, to possibly translating economic benefits into more equitable distribution of health care resources.

Østerås, M. Stokstad Antibody levels in bulk tank milk (BTM) against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are used to classify BRSV status of herds. The aim of this study was to investigate how these levels correspond with the time at which the herds were infected. Bulk tank milk, individual milk and serum samples from cows and young stock were investigated using an indirect ELISA. Screenings of BTM from 89 dairy herds during two winter seasons revealed a prevalence of positive herds from 82 per cent to 85 per cent. Eleven herds showed a marked increase in antibody levels between two screenings, indicating new infection. However, two of these herds had been free from BRSV for the last five to seven years. Two newly infected herds were monitored for four years and did not appear to get reinfected. Surprisingly, the BTM antibody levels in these herds remained high throughout the study period, but fluctuated significantly. This shows that the levels of antibodies in BTM can remain high for several years, even in herds where reinfection does not occur. BTM serology is a useful tool in the monitoring of infectious diseases in dairy herds, but has limitations as a diagnostic tool for BRSV infections.","Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a pneumovirus of the paramyxoviridae family (Valarcher and Taylor 2007) . The infection is prevalent worldwide (Elvander 1996 , Paton and others 1998 , Uttenthal and others 2000 , Klem and others 2013 , and BRSV is considered one of the major pathogens of the bovine respiratory disease complex (Griffin 1997 , Snowder and others 2006 , Brodersen 2010 . To diagnose the infection, different strategies can be chosen according to the given situation and the purpose. For larger epidemiological studies, antibody analyses are used (Hägglund and others 2006 , Beaudeau and others 2010 , Ohlson and others 2010 , Klem and others 2013 . Infected animals seroconvert and IgG can be measured in serum and milk long after the virus is no longer present. Studies on the longevity of antibodies against BRSV are scarce, but Elvander (1996) found that such antibodies could be detected in the serum of adult cattle for at least two years postinfection.
The virus is reported to spread effectively in a herd during outbreaks, resulting in high within-herd prevalence of antibody positive animals (Rossi and Kiesel 1974 , Stott and others 1980 , Verhoeff and van Nieuwstadt 1984 , Bidokhti and others 2009 . Antibodies in bulk tank milk (BTM), pooled milk samples from a selected number of cows or serum from several animals at a selected age have been used to classify a herd or given population (Paton and others 1998 , Uttenthal and others 2000 , Klem and others 2013 , Ohlson and others 2013 . Since animals are known to be seropositive for a long time, classification of herds based on serology in young animals (Klem and others 2013) , or pooled milk samples from primiparous cows (Ohlson and others 2013) , will give a more up-to-date picture than BTM testing. Recent studies show that testing of antibodies in BTM is a reliable tool for identification of BRSV-negative herds (Klem and others 2013, Ohlson and others 2013) .
For several important infections in dairy cattle, testing of antibodies in BTM is used as an effective and inexpensive method to determine a herd's exposure to infectious agents (Niskanen 1993, Booth and others 2013) . Cost-effective methods to classify the infection status of herds are of interest for several reasons. Such knowledge can be used to reduce the risk of virus transmission when animals are traded and as a diagnostic tool in the investigation of herd health problems. It may also be used in large-scale studies, such as screenings for surveillance or control purposes.
Several methods are available for detection of antibodies against BRSV, including virus neutralisation tests and different ELISAs, of which the indirect ELISA is most commonly used. In a neutralisation test, the level of antibodies in a sample is measured quantitatively. The indirect ELISA is not developed as a quantitative assay; its function is primarily to differentiate between negative and positive samples, and to be semiquantitative at antibody levels where seroconversion in individual animals is usually seen. Outside this range, there may be a weaker correlation between the ELISA optical density (OD) values and the actual level of antibodies in the sample.
The aim of the present study was to see how the level of antibodies against BRSV in BTM can be interpreted with respect to the Veterinary Record (2014) doi: 10.1136/vr.102403 time at which herds are infected with BRSV. Subsidiary aims were to investigate 1. the antibody levels in BTM in the dairy herds in a geographical region over two winter seasons; 2. the dynamics of antibodies against BRSV in BTM in two selected herds for four years after exposure to BRSV; 3. if a marked increase in antibody levels in paired BTM samples, or a high level in a single BTM sample, reflect an active/recent infection in the herd; 4. the potential of an indirect ELISA to measure the quantitative level of antibodies in BTM, single serum and milk samples.
The study was designed as a cross-sectional, repeated study over a period from December 2009 to November 2013. It consisted of three different substudies.
BTM samples were collected from herds with 20 or more cow-years (the mean number of cows in a herd during one year) in Akershus County in Eastern Norway. In total, 108 herds met the criteria, representing 60 per cent of the total number of herds in this county. Three of these herds were excluded due to the use of a vaccine against BRSV, leaving a total of 105 herds to be included at the start of the study. The number of herds tested declined in the course of the sampling period due to farms shutting down and failure to take samples. Bulk tank milk from the herds was collected on four occasions: in December 2009 (n=99), February 2010 (n=99), December 2010 (n=99) and February 2011 (n=95). Eighty-nine herds were sampled on all four occasions. The herd size and number of lactating cows contributing to the BTM in each herd was registered at the first stage of sampling.
In March 2010, a questionnaire was sent by mail to the owners of the 99 herds screened in December 2009. They were asked to report signs of respiratory disease in the herd between September 2009 and February 2010. The relationship between increase in BTM level and occurrence of respiratory disease was investigated using an one-way analysis of variance. The significance was calculated using Median Sign Test. Relationships were deemed to be statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05.
Herds were selected based on the results from the two screenings during the first season. The three herds that seroconverted from negative to positive on BTM testing and the 10 herds with an increase in antibody level equal to or higher than 20 per cent positivity (PP) measured by an indirect ELISA were invited to participate in the individual survey. Of these, 11 were willing to participate and included. Blood (serum) and individual milk samples from all lactating cows were collected from these herds after the second BTM screening, from March to April 2010. In addition, serum samples from a mean of five animals (range 1 to 10) aged from 5 to 18 months were collected in each herd since seropositive young animals can indicate a recent infection. Animals younger than five months were not included to avoid interference of maternally derived antibodies.
Two of the herds included in part two were followed over a longer time period due to clinical and serological indications of recent infection in the herd, and willingness to contribute to the project. In both herds, the farmer reported respiratory disease in the period between the first two BTM screenings. Herd 1 converted from negative in screening one to positive in screening two in the BTM samples (PP 1.4 and 95.4). Herd 2 was positive for antibodies against BRSV in the first screening but had a clearly increased PP value in the second BTM screening (PP 33.5 and 129.2). BTM was collected every second week and serum samples were collected every second month in each of these herds from five homebred animals that were born after the infection during the period from March 2010 to November 2013. The samples were used to check that a new introduction of BRSV had not occurred during the study period.
BTM samples used in the first and the third studies were collected at the farm by the driver of the milk truck and transported the same day at 4°C to the dairy and were stored at -20°C until they were dispatched by overnight delivery to the laboratory, where they were kept frozen at the same temperature until analysis. The individual samples used in the second and third studies and the BTM samples in study 2 were collected from the herds by the same veterinary surgeon and dispatched by overnight delivery to the laboratory on the same day. Blood and milk samples were centrifuged and the serum or skimmed milk was extracted before being stored at -20°C until they were analysed. An indirect ELISA (SVANOVIR BRSV-Ab, Svanova Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to analyse for antibodies against BRSV, following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the optical density (OD) reading of 450 nm was corrected by the subtraction of OD for the negative control antigen, and PP was calculated as (corrected OD/positive control corrected OD)×100. The serum was diluted 1:25 with PBS-Tween buffer and the milk was analysed undiluted as recommended by the manufacturer. A sample was considered positive if PP≥10 and negative if PP<10. Positive and negative controls were used and reproducibility was monitored by use of in-house controls. The ELISA kit is indicated for use in serum and milk samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests reported by the manufacturer were 94.6 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively.
A BTM sample from each of the 11 herds in study 2 and individual milk and serum samples from 10 animals, that is, five each in two of these herds were diluted with PBS and examined by means of the indirect ELISA. The serum was diluted at a rate of 1:12.5, 1:25, 1:50 and 1:100, and the milk was investigated undiluted and diluted by a ratio of 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. All samples were tested on the same plate. The ELISA results from the different dilutions were plotted in a diagram to evaluate their linear function.
The analyses were performed using JMP V.8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
The prevalence of positive herds based on BTM of the four screenings varied from 83 per cent to 85 per cent. The geographical distribution of the 89 herds and their BTM status in the first and last sampling are presented in Fig 1. The results of the 89 herds sampled at all four occasions are presented in Table 1 . The majority of herds were found to be positive for antibodies against BRSV in the first and the last sampling. The negative herds were clustered in two regions in the county, with a few single negative herds outside these areas. Negative and positive herds were found in close proximity. 6.7 per cent (6 out of 89) of the herds went from antibody negative to positive, while 6.7 per cent from positive to negative (6 out of 89). 77.5 per cent (69 out of 89) were positive in both, and 9.0 per cent (8 out of 89) were negative in both the first and the last samplings. In three of the herds, all the young stock up to a certain age was negative, and all animals above that age were positive. The time of exposure was therefore presumed to be between the age of the oldest negative and the youngest positive animal. The results indicated that 9 of the 11 herds had a recent infection (<17 months ago). For two of the herds (herds 3 and 4), the results indicated that BRSV had not been in the herd for the last five to seven years. The level of antibodies detected was also lowest for these herds. The percentage of positive animals contributing to the BTM was also lowest for herds 3 and 4, but the mean PP of the positive animals was high (114 and 86, respectively).
BRSV infection occurred in the two herds in December 2009 (herd 1) and January 2010 (herd 2). The long-term development of the BTM antibody level in the two herds following the infection is shown in Fig 3. Serological investigation of young animals consistently yielded negative results, indicating that there was no new introduction of BRSV in the study period. BTM from the two herds remained strongly positive for four years after the infection. The BTM antibody level was high at all samplings, but for both herds, the PP value varied between BTM samples collected only two weeks apart. Both herds had a high increase between the first and second samplings two months apart (94 and 96 PP difference, respectively). Apart from the first sample, the PP value was never below 52 in any of the herds during the four years.
The mean level of antibodies in the series of diluted samples of BTM, individual milk and serum are presented in Fig 4. In general, the curves were close to linear. Fig 5 presents the descending level of antibodies in series of diluted BTM samples from 11 herds. The form of the curve for each herd is similar, although the start PP value differs distinctly from PP 36 (herd 3) to 108 (herd 2).
The prevalence of antibodies against BRSV in BTM in the study area was similar for each of the four screenings, and thus from season to season. The time points were chosen in order to cover two winter seasons, as the peak incidence of clinical cases of respiratory disease by experience is expected to occur in the winter months. Some herds remained negative during the study period, but the majority were positive on both occasions. In a few herds, the results indicated elimination and new introduction of BRSV infection. Measurement of antibodies in BTM is a very slow changing tool to monitor BRSV infection in a herd. Klem and others (2013) found the elimination rate and number of new introductions of virus on a herd level to be high. In that study, the herds were classified based on serological findings in a group of young animals, which gives a more updated classification. Testing using BTM has lower power with regard to the correct classification of a herd's virus status than testing of individual milk samples and testing of serum from young animals (Klem and others 2013, Ohlson and others 2013) . Some negative herds were located in close proximity to positive herds. This may be due to better biosecurity measures in the negative herds. Another possible explanation is that the nearby positive herds are negative for virus, and thus do not represent a risk. Since the The herds were selected based on a high increase in level of antibodies (PP) against BRSV in two consecutive BTM samplings prior to the sampling occasion shown *The time since infection is based on analyses of antibodies in serum from the lactating cows and younger animals. The lower limit is defined by the age of the oldest animal negative for BRSV antibodies and the upper limit by the youngest positive animal. When all animals tested positive, the time since infection is indicated as less than the age of the youngest sampled animal PP, per cent positivity present study also shows that herds can be BTM-antibody-positive for more than four years without reinfection, the latter is likely. It would be interesting to see if herds can keep a negative status in proximity to herds that go through a new infection. In this study, both the number of negative herds and herds with new infection were too low to allow such investigations. Relatively large fluctuations in the PP values in samples taken only two weeks apart were found, and thus care should be taken when interpreting the results of a single BTM sample. A high value does not necessarily mean that BRSV has been present in the herd recently. Even a relatively large increase in paired samples taken two weeks apart can be observed in herds without viral introduction, based on the negative antibody status of younger animals. Detection of antibodies against BRSV in young cattle to reveal new introduction into a herd should be an adequate measure as the virus is reported to spread rapidly in herds during outbreaks (Rossi and Kiesel 1974 , Stott and others 1980 , Verhoeff and van Nieuwstadt 1984 , Bidokhti and others 2009 . The fluctuation cannot be explained by methodological errors as analyses of reproducibility show stable values for the positive controls. The level of antibodies in BTM is influenced by the composition of the milking herd. The immune status (antibody levels against BRSV) of the individual cows, the milk yield and which animals contribute to the bulk tank milk from day to day are the main reasons for fluctuating levels of antibodies in the BTM. Age distribution will also influence the outcome as the prevalence of antibodies against BRSV within a herd is reported to increase with increasing age of the animals (Bidokhti and others 2009, Klem and others 2013) . This might be due to reinfections that boost the antibody response.
The indirect ELISA used in the study is designed to give a semiquantitative measure of the level of antibodies in samples with a cut-off value at PP 10, categorising the results as positive or negative. However, the data from the series dilutions shows that the kit gives a reliable quantitative measure of the antibody levels both for serum and milk and that data can be calculated as continuous variable.
Serology of young animals supported that the majority of the 11 herds with markedly increased levels of antibodies against BRSV had had a recent infection. Interestingly, in the herds with negative young stock, there was a clear age limit between negative and positive animals. The interval between the oldest negative and the youngest positive should therefore be a good indicator of time since exposure. In the two herds with no signs of recent infection, the positive animals were the oldest and they had most likely had an infection many years ago. The results showed that a BTM sample can be positive with relatively high PP values despite only one or a few positive animals contributing to the milk tank. The long duration of detectable antibodies combined with the many different factors that influence the composition of BTM makes the interpretation of positive samples as a measure of recent infection difficult.
The two herds followed over four years after an infection generally had high levels of antibodies in BTM throughout this period, which again shows that the BTM will remain positive for at least four years after an infection, without reinfections. There was a high variation in level of antibodies in BTM during the whole study period. This also supports the previous finding that a markedly increased antibody level in paired BTM can indicate, but is not necessarily the result of, a recent infection. The antibody level in the BTM samples decreased slightly at the end of the study period. Nevertheless, the continuous large fluctuations only weeks apart indicates that guidelines based on antibody level in BTM might not be suitable for BRSV.
This study shows that measurement of antibodies in BTM is a very slow changing tool to monitor BRSV in a herd. The antibody level in BTM will remain high for at least four years after a BRSV infection, even without reinfection. A positive BTM sample can be caused by only a few seropositive animals, and even a relatively strong increase in paired BTM test results does not necessarily indicate a new infection. This information is useful when BTM is used both in investigation of outbreaks and for surveillance or control purposes. BTM gives information on a large group of animals and are often readily available, but sampling of young animals will provide better and more updated information of the BRSV status of the herd.

144,6bb0038a55ff68a2f47a36e8c845126da7fea61b,"Cadmium is an environmentally hazardous metal, which causes toxicity in humans. Inhalation of cigarette smoke and industrial fumes containing cadmium are sources of cadmium exposure. It is responsible for the malfunction of various organs, leading to disease particularly in the lungs, liver and kidneys. In the present study, the effect of cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 ) on cell viability, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-10 cytokines at various concentrations and incubation durations were assessed in MRC-9 human normal lung and A549 human lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. Cell viability was measured using a crystal violet dye binding assay. The expression levels of the cytokines were measured by cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl 2 compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl 2 concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl 2 concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium. The results indicated that CdCl 2 affected the expression levels of the cytokines and led to cytotoxicity in human lung cells, and suggested that compounds which reduce inflammation may prevent cadmium toxicity.","Cadmium is a hazardous environmental pollutant with economic value, however no known biological function. It is an industrial toxicant, which has been classified as a type I carcinogen (1, 2) . It is a highly reactive metal and complexes with ligands to form different compounds, which affect numerous biological molecules and organs (3) . A significant quantity of cadmium is introduced into the environment through anthropogenic activities, including copper and nickel smelting, electroplating, galvanizing, nickel-cadmium battery production, welding, phosphate fertilizers, sewage sludge and cigarette smoke (3, 4) . The toxicokinetics of cadmium depend on the form of cadmium, the dose, the time of exposure and the accumulation in the affected organ (5, 6) . Cadmium can be observed in all organs of the body; however, the majority accumulates in the lungs, liver and kidney (7, 8) . Although the level of cadmium exposure to humans is low, it can accumulate and remain in the system for 15-30 years (9) (10) (11) , which is responsible for the toxicity in various organs. Cadmium molecular toxicity has been associated with various diseases, including tumor formation.
Our previous study investigated cadmium toxicity and the protective effect of different antioxidant or chelating compounds, which reduce the toxic effect of cadmium in liver cells (12) (13) (14) (15) . Inhalation is one of the predominant causes of cadmium exposure in humans and it has been reported to cause chronic inflammation and is responsible for various lung diseases (16) (17) (18) (19) . Cytokines are the predominant mediators of inflammation. Interleukin (IL)-1α is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, which regulates the expression levels of other cytokines and chemokines (20) (21) (22) . Conversely, cells respond to various toxic insults by secreting different anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, for defense and repair mechanisms (23) .
The aim of the present study was to measure the expression levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines and to determine the viability of normal and cancerous human lung cells treated with various concentrations of cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 ) for different incubation periods in order to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. The IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines were selected as they were significantly upregulated following treatment with 75 µM CdCl 2 after 24 h in our previous study using human A549 cancer cells (24) .
Chemicals. The F12 K medium, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution (100X), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA solution (1X), amphotericin B (1,000X), phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium, CdCl 2 , 25% glutaraldehyde and crystal violet were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The human IL-10 (cat. no. ELH-IL10-001) and human IL-1α (cat. no. ELH-IL1alpha-001) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from Ray Biotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA, USA).
Maintenance of the cell lines. The human MRC-9 normal lung (cat. no. CCL-212) and human A549 lung cancer (cat. no. CCL-185) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The supplied frozen cells were cultured, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were grown in 10 ml minimum essential medium (American Type Culture Collection) (MRC-9) or F12K (A549) medium, containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.025 µg/ml amphotericin B and 10% FBS in T-75 cm 2 tissue culture flasks at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator (Nuaire Co., Plymouth, MN, USA).
Crystal violet viability test. The viability test was performed as previously reported (25) . Briefly, to investigate the effect of CdCl 2 on the viability of the cells, ~1x10 5 A549 lung cancer cells or 5x10 4 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and allowed to stabilize overnight in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37˚C. The cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 or 200 µM CdCl 2 in a final volume of 1 ml in triplicate wells and were subsequently incubated for 24 h at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Following incubation, the viability of the cells was measured. The median lethal dose (LD 50 ) value was calculated from the LD 50 graph where the two lines meet, according to a previous study (26) .
Preparation of cell extracts. A total of ~3.9x10 6 A549 lung cancer cells or 1.95x10 6 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into T-75 cm 2 flasks in complete medium. Each cell line was treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 µM CdCl 2 in triplicate flasks for various durations (0, 6, 12, 18 or 24 h) and were incubated at 37˚C at 5% CO 2 . At the end of each treatment period, the cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 1,350 x g for 5 min. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) lysis buffer, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, by homogenization in a vial on ice three times for 10 sec using a polytron homogenizer (Pro Scientific, Inc., Oxford, CT, USA). The homogenate was subsequently transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 12,740 x g for 10 min at 4˚C to remove the lysed cell membrane debris. The supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and the cell lysates were stored at -20˚C for cytokine analysis.
Protein estimation. The protein concentration of the cell lysates were determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein. The protein standards and working reagents were prepared, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In triplicate eppendorf tubes, 25 µl standard or lysate sample were added. The working reagent (500 µl) was added to each tube, incubated at 37˚C for 30 min and was subsequently measured at 562 nm in a Beckman spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). The concentration of the lysate samples were determined using the standard curve.
ELISA. The human IL-1α and IL-10 ELISA kits were purchased from Ray Biotech Inc. and used for the quantitative measurement of the expression levels of the cytokines in human lung cells. The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensity of the color in the 96-well plate was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader (EL 800; Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).
Statistical analysis. The viability and cytokine assay results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (n=3). All CdCl 2 -treated cell data are presented as a percentage value compared with the untreated control cells (100%). The data were analyzed for significance by Dunnet's multiple comparison test, using GraphPad Prism software version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Effect of CdCl 2 on the cell viability of human MRC-9 normal lung and A549 cancer cells. The viability of the normal and cancerous lung cells exposed to various CdCl 2 concentrations was demonstrated to be dose-dependent (Fig. 1) . The viability of the normal lung MRC-9 cells was reduced by 6, 11, 11, 44, 55, 60 and 75% (Fig. 1A) , while the viability of the A594 lung cancer cells was decreased by 13, 36, 42, 58, 65, 76 and 81% ( (Fig. 2) . The cytokine levels decreased with increasing concentration and duration (Fig. 2) . The results clearly demonstrated that normal MRC-9 lung cells responded to the toxic effect of CdCl 2 with high expression levels of the cytokines in the lysate at early time points and high concentrations and longer exposure durations of CdCl 2 demonstrated toxic effects on the expression levels of the cytokines. Fig. 3 , the expression levels of IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines in the A549 lung cancer cells treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 µM CdCl 2 concentrations for 6, 12, 18 or 24 h were detected. The lung cancer cells treated with 50 µM CdCl 2 for 12 h demonstrated the maximum expression of each cytokine, and the expression levels decreased as the duration of exposure and concentration of CdCl 2 increased (Fig. 3) . The results clearly demonstrated the response of the A549 lung cancer cells to the toxic effect of CdCl 2 , with high expression of cytokines at high concentrations and longer exposure durations of CdCl 2 , demonstrating the toxic effect on the expression of cytokines.
The widespread industrial usage of cadmium presents a health risk directly and indirectly to humans and other living organisms. Industrial waste fumes, burning of fossil fuels and cigarette smoke are the predominant direct sources of cadmium exposure to humans. It is estimated that 90% of the inhaled cadmium particles are absorbed by lung tissue and cause pulmonary damage, emphysema and lung cancer (16) (17) (18) (19) . Organisms respond to xeno-biotics via inflammation and it is initiated through various signaling molecules, including cytokines, in the cells. To date, few investigations into the expression levels of the cytokines, IL-1α (pro-inflammatory) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory), have been reported (27) . Therefore, elucidating the expression levels of IL-1α and IL-10, and the cell viability at various CdCl 2 concentrations and incubation durations in human MRC-9 normal lung and A549 lung cancer cells may provide an understanding of how lung cells response to cadmium toxicity.
The results indicated that A549 lung cancer cells were observed to be more sensitive to CdCl 2 compared with the MRC-9 normal lung cells. The difference in their sensitivities was reflected in their LD 50 values. The LD 50 of CdCl 2 for the normal MRC-9 lung cells was 112.5 µM, whereas the LD 50 of the lung cancer cells was 87.5 µM (Fig. 1) . A previous study demonstrated that carcinomas contain significantly less 
metallothionein compared with their corresponding normal cells (28) . This may be one of the contributing factors for the higher sensitivity of cancer cells to cadmium toxicity, however, further investigation is required to prove this hypothesis. Normal lung cells and the lung cancer cells revealed high expression levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines following treatment with CdCl 2 (Figs. 1 and 2) . In a previous study (29) , a significant increase in IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines was observed in the tested cells, when human-derived bronchial epithelium was exposed to tobacco smoke components. Furthermore, other previous studies have revealed that cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammation, to activate the cytokine network and the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (30, 31) . The higher expression of cytokines, which lead to inflammation, may be responsible for the later cytotoxic effects in the cells, which lead to a decrease in viability, as observed in the present study (Fig. 1 ). This is supported by a previous study (32) demonstrating that high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to cadmium exposure cause pathological conditions in a biological system.
When the cytokine levels were compared in the normal lung cells, a higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1α, was observed compared with the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, at 6 h exposure (Fig. 2) . A high level of IL-1α cytokine in the cells exposed to xeno-biotics has been reported to inhibit the expression of metallothionein protein (33) . In that previous study, IL-1α inhibited the mRNA expression of metallothionein in endometrial stromal cells and amniotic cells treated with CdCl 2 . Based on the above report, the present study hypothesized that increased levels of IL-1α may reduce the protein expression of metallothionein, which in turn leads to the increase in unbound CdCl 2 in the cell, which may now damage biological molecules, including proteins, as shown by the decreased expression of IL-1α and IL-10 observed in the present study (Fig. 2) .
The expression pattern of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines from the A549 cancer lung cells was different compared with the normal lung cells. The maximum levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines were observed at a later period (12 h, Fig. 3 ) in the lung cancer cells compared with the normal cells (6 h, Fig. 2 ). In addition, it was also observed that each cytokine was highly expressed in cancer cells compared with the normal cells treated with CdCl 2 (Figs. 2 and 3) . A similar observation was observed when the cytokine levels of patients with cancer were compared with the cytokine levels of normal individuals (34) . The delayed expression and higher expression levels of the cytokines observed in cancer cells may be as a result of the malfunction of the cell regulatory mechanisms commonly observed in cancer cells.
Lung cancer cells demonstrated higher expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, compared with the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1α (Fig. 3) . This was consistent with our previously reported findings (24) and another previous study (35) . IL-10 acts as anti-inflammatory cytokine and is also responsible for cell death. IL-10 cytokine has been demonstrated to decrease the translocation of nuclear factor-κB, which is important in increasing apoptotic markers, which later leads to apoptotic cell death (31) . Therefore, the higher levels of IL-10 cytokine in the A549 lung cancer cells may be one of the reasons for the higher cytotoxicity caused by CdCl 2 (Fig. 1) .
In the present study, higher cadmium concentrations (100 and 150 µM) decreased the expression levels of the cytokines in the normal and cancer cells (Figs. 2 and 3) . Higher concentrations of cadmium induced higher levels of reactive oxygen species, which degrade macromolecules, including proteins and DNA (12, 13, 36) . The low expression levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines in each cell line may also be linked to the toxic effect of unbound cadmium in the cells, as a result of the lack of metallothionein protein. This result is consistent with a previous study, which reported inhibition of the expression of IL-1α in rat hepatocytes following treatment with high concentrations of CdCl 2 (32) . In addition, longer exposure durations may also be a factor in causing higher toxicity, as decreased expression of cytokines were observed with increased incubation durations in the present study (Figs. 2 and 3) . The longer exposure duration led to the accumulation of cadmium inside of the cell, which in turn causes decreased cytokine levels leading to cell death.
In conclusion, the viability result revealed that human A549 lung cancer cells exhibited higher sensitivity to CdCl 2 compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. Furthermore, 
the cells demonstrated a differential expression of the cytokines in response to CdCl 2 . The maximum cytokine levels were observed in the normal MRC-9 lung cells at an early incubation time (6 h) compared with the lung cancer cells (12 h) , demonstrating an early immune response of normal lung cells. The present study clearly demonstrated the effect of CdCl 2 on the expression levels of cytokines in lung cells and suggested that compounds, which activate the cytokines and reduce inflammation, may prevent cadmium toxicity.",Effect of cadmium on the expression levels of interleukin-1α and interleukin-10 cytokines in human lung cells,"ODEWUMI, CAROLINE; LATINWO, LEKAN M.; SINCLAIR, ANDRE; BADISA, VEERA L.D.; ABDULLAH, AHKINYALA; BADISA, RAMESH B.",Mol Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4626121/,256,2456,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,ed21f99a11ebb65e8c3a6fb8d00b7141011916b0,"The 3rd Workshop on Paediatric Virology, which took place on October 7th, 2017 in Athens, Greece, highlighted the role of breast feeding in the prevention of viral infections during the first years of life. Moreover, it focused on the longterm outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus infections in prematurely born infants and emphasised the necessity for the development of relevant preventative strategies. Other topics that were covered included the vaccination policy in relation to the migration crisis, mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B and c viruses, vaccination against human papilloma viruses in boys and advances on intranasal live-attenuated vaccination against influenza. Emphasis was also given to the role of probiotics in the management of viral infections in childhood, the potential association between viral infections and the pathogenesis of asthma, fetal and neonatal brain imaging and the paediatric intensive care of children with central nervous system viral infections. Moreover, an interesting overview of the viral causes of perinatal mortality in ancient Greece was given, where recent archaeological findings from the Athenian Agora's bone well were presented. Finally, different continuing medical educational options in Paediatric Virology were analysed and evaluated. The present review provides an update of the key topics discussed during the workshop.","occurring in infancy and childhood (4, 5) . These developments and changes highlight the demand for undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in Paediatric Virology, which combines Paediatrics with Virology, Epidemiology, Molecular Medicine, Evidence-based Medicine, clinical Governance, Quality Improvement, and Pharmacology and Immunology (5) .
The 3rd Workshop on Paediatric Virology was entitled 'Paediatric Virology: Interaction between basic science and clinical practice'. It was held on October 7th, 2017 in Athens, Greece, as an official session of the 22nd World Congress on Advances in Oncology and the 20th International Symposium on Molecular Medicine. Its aim was to bring together virologists and paediatric health professionals and encourage them to collaborate as an international network to promote paediatric health. Moreover, during the workshop, Nobelist laureate Professor Harald zur Hausen, Emeritus Professor of Virology at the University of Freiburg in Germany, who received the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of human papilloma viruses (HPVs) causing cervical cancer and Professor Anne Greenough, Professor of Neonatology and clinical Respiratory Physiology at King's college London, UK and Vice President of Science and Research at the Royal college of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), were honoured by the Paediatric Virology Study Group (PVSG) for their indisputable academic, research and publishing contribution to Paediatric Virology.
The present review provides an overview on the wealth of new material from different areas of neonatal and paediatric viral infections presented and discussed during the workshop. Interestingly, 7 out of the 10 top key messages (Table I) (Table II) , included recommendations on specific prevention strategies against viral infections. Along with the significant role of human breast milk and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, these issues included the necessity of the vaccination policy in relation to the migration crisis, prevention of hepatitis in newborns, recent advances on influenza vaccines, male vaccination against HPVs and the the preventative role of probiotics in the management of viral infections in children.
The importance of diet during the first years of life. A number of different infections occur during the early period of life (6) . Several of these infections are viral, e.g., herpes-group viruses, polyomaviruses and Torque teno viruses, and these result in long-time persistence and latency within human specific cell types (6) . The fate of the latent genomes seems to vary substantially. They may remain dormant for the whole lifetime without any recognisable side effect. During prolonged latency, their genomes may become defective and can eventually be degraded. In particular, herpes-group viruses may become re-activated, leading locally to viral production and cell lysis. The interaction of the latent genomes with mutagenic chemical, physical or other biological factors may dysregulate the control of latency or persistence and may thus result in local exacerbations, mainly as the result of immunoreactivity (6) .
Prolonged human breast feeding (>6 months) has been documented to have a beneficial effect on the avoidance of viral infections, e.g., norovirus-and rotavirus-related infections, which can potentially be lethal for newborn babies (7) . It has also been shown that it reduces the risk of developing certain malignant tumours arising in early childhood, e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or in young adolescence, e.g., Hodgkin's disease (HD). Apparently, specific sugars in human milk modify the receptors blocking the uptake of noroviruses and rotaviruses during the breast feeding phase. The maturation of the immune system during this period, subsequently, facilitates an effective immune response during the weaning period. The uptake of specific sialic acids, not produced in humans, but present in cow milk and meat products, beginning during the weaning time, results in their incorporation into the cell surface glycoproteins and gangliosides. The resulting modification of cell surface receptors alters their susceptibility to specific viral infections, e.g., human polyomavirus type 9 and others. Current analyses suggest that these receptors now permit the binding of infectious agents present in dairy cattle serum and milk products, leading to their longtime persistence and latency and their potential pathogenicity under conditions of reactivation. Thus, the protective effects of breast feeding, which allows for the maturation of the immune response during the first years of life, emerges as critical period, which determines the uptake and latency of specific infections (7).
infants. chronic respiratory morbidity is common in prematurely born infants and has a multifactorial aetiology (8) . Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by RSV increase this morbidity. Although prematurely born infants are functionally (9,10) and genetically (11) predisposed to RSV LRTIs, their lung function in infancy is worse after the LRTI (12, 13) . RSV LRTIs have more long-term effects, as evidenced by very prematurely born infants, who have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPd) and then subsequently suffer from an RSV LRTI hospitalisation; in the first 2 years after birth these infants need increased healthcare utilisation and have poorer pulmonary functions at school age (14) . There are limited data to suggest that rhinovirus (RV) may adversely affect on respiratory-related outcomes in prematurely born infants. In a previous study, in 8 prematurely born infants with BPd, the development of RV LRTIs was associated with a sustained worsening of their clinical status, requiring the addition of novel therapies for prolonged periods of time (15) . Furthermore, in another study, prematurely born infants, who had developed RV LRTI, during infancy, had higher healthcare utilisation costs, including greater numbers of hospital, outpatient and respiratory-related general practitioner (GP) attendances, than infants without a viral LRTI (16) .
Ongoing research at King's college London (UK) has recently re-examined prematurely born cohorts at school age (5-8 years) for whom data on all respiratory viral infections in infancy, as well as whether or not hospital admission was required were recorded (17) . The RV group had a poorer lung function than those who had not suffered an LRTI during infancy. Cluster analysis of the data demonstrated that infants with an extremely low birthweight requiring prolonged ventilation were at an increased risk of suffering from an RV LRTI in infancy and had higher healthcare utilisation and impaired lung function at school age (18) . These data suggest that both RSV and RV LRTI increase chronic respiratory morbidity in prematurely born infants and, as a consequence, this should be taken into consideration regarding the development of relevant preventative strategies.
Migration crisis and vaccination policy. Over the past 2 years, Greece, one of the principal gateway countries of the European Union (EU), has experienced an increased inflow of refugees and migrants arriving by sea to the Greek islands, such as the Dodecanese Islands, Lesbos, Samos and Agathonisi (19) (20) (21) . By the end of 2015, 856,723 individuals in total had arrived in the country, while between January 1st and November 13th, 2016, the corresponding number reported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) was 170,553 individuals (21, 22) . The majority of individuals arriving in Greece came from Syria (approximately 60%), followed by Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Algeria (23) . Following the implementation of the EU-Turkey agreement and the closure of the Northern borders of Greece in March 2016, >60,000 refugees and migrants remain stranded in the country, out of which 37% are children (19) .
It is worth noting that, to date, several studies have highlighted lower immunisation coverage among refugees and migrants compared to European-born individuals (24) . This has been attributed to the low vaccination coverage in their countries of origin due to the collapse or inadequacy of their healthcare systems. Several problems have also limited the access of refugees and migrants to vaccination in Europe, such as the lack of information regarding their immunisation status, financial problems of the hosting countries and the lack of collaboration among public health authorities of European countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a high vaccination coverage is required for the protection of refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, as well as for the population of the hosting countries, which should ensure appropriate vaccinations, extending their routine immunisation schedule to individuals on the move irrespective of their legal status (25) .
In Greece, an imperative need emerged for implementing supplementary immunisation activities, particularly to refugee children living in the 'Points of care', all over the country (19) . Vaccinations were conducted in the form of a mass campaign by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that have significant experience and expertise in conducting such campaigns, such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Red cross and doctors of the World, under the coordination of the General Secretariat for Public Health of the Hellenic Ministry of Health. In this framework, the recommendations on refugees and migrants vaccination of the National Immunisation committee were followed and >30,000 vaccines were given (26) . According to Taking into account the difficulties, including vaccine supply, the above-mentioned results are really encouraging (19) . In fact, it is important that a great number of immunised refugee children are regularly attending lessons in Greek schools. Public Health Authorities and NGOs have indeed worked hard together, in order to protect children, living through one of the biggest crisis of our times, from infectious diseases. The challenge, today, is to continue the immunisation of refugees and migrants in Greece, as part of routine primary healthcare and to develop a plan for providing immunisation to all newly-arrived refugees and migrants. For this reason, an effective strategy should be to tailor immunisation services on the specific needs of the target populations (27) .
infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are responsible for 90% of all hepatitis mortalities globally, with an estimated 257 million individuals infected with HBV and another 71 million with HCV (28) . As 90% of infants infected with HBV at birth will become chronic carriers, motherto-child transmission (MTcT) is responsible for 35-50% of the chronic HBV infections (29) , which can develop into severe liver disease including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis. Compared to horizontal transmission, MTCT can increase the risk of the development of HCC (30) . MTCT of HBV occurs mostly during birth and more rarely in utero or post-natally. The risk is increased in HBeAg-positive mothers compared to HBeAg-negative mothers. There are also geographical differences in the risk of MTCT of HBV, being higher in Asia than in Africa (31) . MTCT of HCV occurs at a rate of 5% and is the major cause of paediatric HCV infection (32) .
The prevention of MTCT of HBV and HCV is one of the 5 synergistic measures adopted by the 194 member states of the WHO in their commitment towards the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 (33) . The prevention of MTCT of HBV can be achieved in 99% of cases, by delivering the birth dose of the HBV vaccine within 24 h of birth. The risk of MTCT of HBV is highest in infants born to younger mothers, who are HBeAg-positive and with high viral loads. Vaccination with <3 doses is also a risk factor for MTCT of HBV. Testing pregnant women for HBsAg, treating those positive before delivery and administering the birth dose and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) to infants at birth can successfully prevent MTCT of HBV (34) . The rate of MTCT of HBV can be reduced by caesarian section delivery (35), with breast feeding not posing a risk factor for MTCT of HBV (36) . By contrast, neither the mode of delivery nor the type of feeding has been shown to be a risk factor for MTCT in the case of HCV (37) . HIV co-infection doubles the risk of MTCT of HCV (38) .
Although a high HCV viral load is a risk factor for MTcT (39) , it is currently not a preventable risk factor as direct acting antivirals (dAAs) have not been approved during pregnancy. The universal screening for HCV has been shown to be more effective than risk factor-based screening in preventing MTCT. The approval of DAAs in pregnant women and children will open new horizons in the prevention of MTCT of HCV. Interrupting MTCT of HBV and HCV is an intervention that can contribute to the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 and to averting the high morbidity and mortality of the severe liver disease associated with these viral infections.
HPV infections: Aspects of paediatric relevance. HPVs are small, non-enveloped, double-stranded, circular dNA viruses, belonging to the family Papillomaviridae (40) (41) (42) . HPVs infect epithelial tissue and their life cycle is closely intertwined with the differentiation of the epithelium (41, 42) . HPV requires the host DNA replication machinery in order to replicate its genome. This maintains the keratinocytes in a proliferative state via the action of specific HPV proteins, of which the best characterised are E6 and E7 and thus, creates an environment amenable to carcinogenesis (43) . Breast feeding 'Prolonged breast feeding is clearly of great benefit for babies. Human milk contains some species-specific sugars, which block the uptake of potentially dangerous viruses (e.g., noro-and rotaviruses), which are the cause for high infant mortality for newborn children, specifically in developing parts of this world. During a period of ~6 months of breast feeding the immune system matures and subsequently such infections have a less deleterious impact. The uptake, however, of 5-N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (not produced in humans) by bovine milk and meat leads to the incorporation of this sialic acid into cellular glycoproteins and modifies those receptors, rendering them susceptible for other virus infections (e.g., human polyomavirus type 9 and others).'
HPV 'Vaccination of boys against HPV should be included in the national vaccination programmes at the same age vaccination as girls (8-14 years) . Males are the main transmitters of high risk HPV, having more HPV-positive oropharyngeal and anal cancers than females, and in particular homosexual males would not profit from a herd effect, when 80% or even more of females had been vaccinated. Since, in addition, in most countries the vaccination rate ranges between 20-40% or less, vaccination of boys should be mandatory.'
HPV, human papilloma virus.
HPVs are known to be the aetiologic agents in cervical cancer and in a significant proportion of anogenital cancers (90% of anal cancers, 60-90% of vaginal and vulvar cancers and 30-40% of penile cancers) (44) . More recently, it has become apparent that HPVs are also drivers in a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases, in particular tonsillar and base of tongue carcinomas (45) . In addition, HPVs are associated with a number of benign neoplasms, including common cutaneous warts, genital warts, oral papillomas and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) (44) . More than 150 types of HPVs have been discovered to date. These are primarily classified into either low-or high-risk according to their malignant potential, and into mucosal and cutaneous types. HPV-16 is the foremost high-risk type isolated from cervical, anogenital, and head and neck carcinomas.
Paediatric manifestations of HPV infections include skin warts, oral papillomas, RRP and anogenital warts (46, 47) . Additionally, asymptomatic infections of the oral or tonsillar mucosa, as well as of the genital mucosa in children have been described (46, 47) . Studies on HPV seropositivity in young children indicate a relatively low prevalence of HPV antibodies (approximately 0-10%) (48) . The seroprevalence significantly increases in adolescence with the commencement of sexual activity. Mucosal HPV infection is often described as a sexually transmitted infection; however, the presence of such infections in infants and young children suggests that the virus may also be vertically and horizontally transmitted. There is strong evidence that maternal HPV cervical infection at the time of delivery can be transmitted to the newborn and there is a strong association between development of juvenile RRP and the presence of maternal genital warts during pregnancy (49) . The detection of HPV DNA in spermatozoa and seminal plasma, as well as in amniotic fluid and placental tissue, suggests that peri-conceptual and prenatal transmission may also be possible (46, 47) . HPV can be transmitted horizontally (i.e., by kissing or touch) or to different sites by auto-inoculation (46, 47) . In the case of anogenital warts in particular, sexual abuse remains an important consideration. There are a lack of data on the persistence of HPV infections in children and their relation to the subsequent development of HPV-associated diseases, such as oropharyngeal carcinoma.
The routine vaccination of girls, aged 11-12 years, has been introduced in many countries to reduce the incidence of anogenital cancers. The Nobelist laureate Professor Harald zur Hausen has actively advocated the vaccination of boys for the eradication of HPV infection and has emphasised that male HPV vaccination should be included into the current vaccination programmes. His publication with Professor Karin Michels from Harvard Medical School entitled 'HPV vaccine for all' and published in 2009 in Lancet has been one of the very first publications advocating the vaccination of boys (50) . To date, the United States, canada, Australia, and Austria have currently implemented routine vaccination of girls as well as boys (51) (52) (53) . The recent WHO guidelines recommended the vaccination of girls aged 9-14 years as the primary target population, and the vaccination of additional target populations (females 15 years and older, and males) only if feasible, affordable and cost-effective (54) . Gender-neutral vaccination may achieve greater herd protection effects and direct protection of males; however gender-neutral programmes have only been implemented recently and their impact on HPV-related diseases at a population level remains to be determined (54) . Nevertheless, there are strong data that quadrivalent HPV vaccination is effective in reducing anal intraepithelial neoplasia (50% reduction in the intention-to-treat population and 78% in the per-protocol population) (55) . Similar prospective data for penile cancers and oropharyngeal cancers is lacking; however, there are data suggesting that HPV infections at these sites are reduced following vaccination (56, 57) .
Non-vaccinated children will continue to be affected by paediatric HPV-associated diseases and vaccinated children by HPV types not covered by vaccination. Increasing vaccine coverage may reduce HPV prevalence not only for anogenital infections, but also oral infections. However, vaccination programmes continue to face challenges, in part due to parental fears regarding vaccine safety (58) . Large population-based studies have confirmed vaccine safety (59) . Educational efforts regarding the importance of HPV vaccination and the vaccine's efficacy and safety profile are necessary to achieve higher vaccination coverage.
Live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) have been used in certain European countries, such as UK and Finland, and in the USA and Canada for decades (60, 61) . In addition to their efficient mode of introduction as a nasal spray, in randomised clinical trials, they have been shown to provide better protective efficacy than inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) in children, which are considered to be the main drivers of There are certain performance limitations, one of which is that previous influenza vaccination may modify the immune response after a repeated vaccination (60) . Further studies are warranted to determine the reasons for reduced VE. A recent systematic literature review did not find any evidence of the decreased efficacy of LAIV when administered during two consecutive seasons (67) . On the other hand, the findings of a study that evaluated the impact of repeated vaccination among health care workers were suggestive of decreased serological response among the highly vaccinated group (68) . Another consortium, Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Effectiveness II (SIVE II), is currently evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the LAIV programme in children (69) . The vaccination of healthy children has the potential to provide both direct protection to children, but also indirect protection to vulnerable groups in the general population. Further studies with large sample sizes and a greater number of people in the vaccine-naïve group and in groups with repeated vaccinations are required.
Population-based national health registries are also valuable to generate routine data for measuring the vaccination impact in a timely manner. As the LAIV use has been shown to be beneficial over the past years, continuous enhanced surveillance and further study results are required in order to better understand the USA findings and the possible implications for vaccination policies in Europe and worldwide.
Probiotics and viral infections in childhood. Probiotics (e.g., Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and Saccharomyces) are live microorganisms, which can confer beneficial health effects on the host, when consumed in adequate amounts (70, 71) . They are non-pathogenic in the normal host, resist processing and are able to survive in the human digestive tract. Prebiotics (e.g., Fructo-and Galacto-oligosaccharides) are non-viable food components, which can confer a significant health benefit on the host by modulating intestinal microflora. Synbiotics are a combination of pro-and prebiotics. The gut microflora is a complex ecosystem supporting the structure and function of the intestinal mucosa. Probiotics have the ability to modify the gut microflora either by lowering colonic pH through production of short-chain fatty acids (ScFAs), or by producing antimicrobial compounds and antitoxins, and or by competing with other bacteria for nutrients. They also enhance gut barrier function and play a role in immunomodulation (72, 73) .
Probiotics have been used for the management of children with acute viral diarrhoea as an adjunct to rehydration therapy (74) (75) (76) . To date, 5 paediatric meta-analyses have shown that probiotics reduce the duration of diarrhoea, ranging between -16.8 h and -30.0 h, as well as the risk of diarrhoea lasting for >4 days (74) . The subgroup with rotavirus-associated diarrhoea seemed to be more responsive to probiotics, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) appeared to be the most effective probiotic (75) . The beneficial effects of probiotics seem to be more evident when treatment is initiated early (<48 h) and are strain-and dose-dependent. Probiotics are not useful for treating bacterial diarrhoea (76) .
Probiotics have also been proposed to be helpful in preventing upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs); however the interventions and existing evidence are inconsistent (77, 78) . A recent systematic review (77) of 14 randomised controlled trials (RcTs) suggested that probiotic prophylaxis reduced the number of children, who had one or more URTIs [odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.92] and the number of URTIs per person-year (rate ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). Both outcomes had inconsistent results in the individual studies, reflected in estimates of heterogeneity. A better understanding of the effects of different probiotic strains and a deeper insight into their mechanisms of action are required for the validation of specific strains carrying a potential to modify the frequency and severity of URTIs and gastrointestinal viral infections in infants and children (78) (79) (80) .
Fetal and neonatal brain imaging in viral infections. Fetuses and neonates are susceptible to a wide variety of viral infections most commonly involving the central nervous system (cNS) in greater frequency than adults (81) . Infections of the CNS are a very common worldwide health problem in childhood with significant morbidity and mortality. In children, viruses are the most common cause of cNS infections, followed by bacteria, and less frequently by fungi and other causes. Advances in the prenatal and perinatal care together with technological advent of imaging modalities have enabled timely detection and detailed exploration of symptoms and signs in the neonatal population starting from the fetal life. Although imaging is practically unable to set the diagnosis of viral infection in the fetuses and neonates, moreover to reveal the pathogens, it has, however, the potential to accurately suggest this scenario, map the extent of involvement and direct the investigation and the consultation accordingly. Additionally, it may reveal complications from viral infections that may cause confusion and usually require special treatment (81) .
Some imaging findings are highly suggestive of cNS viral infections in fetuses and neonates (82) . Familiarity with the clinical course, the route of transmission and the imaging appearances usually proves helpful in reaching the correct diagnosis and in prompting timely treatment. In general, sequelae of an intrauterine infection reflect a combination of the pathogens and the stage of fetal development at which the exposure occurred (83) . Congenital infections, occurring during the second and third trimester, may persist in the neonate affecting its general and neurologic status (83) . However, as a rule of thumb, the later the diagnosis of congenital infections is made, the more difficult it is to identify the agent. Additionally, the imaging findings may become non-specific and less conspicuous as incomplete white matter myelination may interfere (83) .
If maternal viral infection is suspected, combining prenatal ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may document the extent of tissue damage and therefore contribute to treatment and counselling (84) . Neonatal head ultrasound, sometimes computed tomography (cT), but mainly MRI (Figs. 1 and 2 ) may reveal sequelae from congenital viral infections (i.e., microcephaly, dystrophic periventricular calcifications, brain atrophy), which may even suggest the causative virus, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) (85) . In previously healthy neonates with viral infection, the imaging investigation of cNS begins with head ultrasound and if further imaging investigation is required, MRI is the modality of choice, even in an emergency setting (86) . Non-complicated meningitis is easier to be recognised clinically; however, since complications of meningitis, such as abscesses, infarcts, venous thrombosis, or extra-axial empyemas are difficult to diagnose clinically, imaging plays a crucial role (87) .
Viral infections can invade the cNS of children, spreading into the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and more rarely into the CNS (88) . The CNS is protected by effective immune responses and multi-layer barriers; however, some viruses enter the CNS with efficiency via the bloodstream or by directly infecting nerves that innervate peripheral tissues, resulting in immune-mediated pathology (89) . Viral infections of the cNS more often cause meningitis, characterised by a high fever, headaches, vomiting, photophobia and neck stiffness and encephalitis, which appear with clinical evidence of neurological dysfunction, such as altered mental status, seizures, behavioral changes and focal neurologic signs (90) . Other clinical manifestations are myelitis, characterised by weakness, bladder dysfunction, flaccid paralysis and reduced or absent reflexes, radiculitis, which is characterised by weakness, shooting pain, dysesthesia and diminished reflexes and complex syndromes, such as meningoencephalitis and encephalomyelitis. Viruses affect different sites of the CNS; enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and mumps virus (MuV) are responsible for >90% of cases of aseptic meningitis, whereas herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of encephalitis in developed countries. Other types of herpes viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cMV, varicellazoster virus (VZV) and human herpes viruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and -7) can invade the brain and influence the neurological status of children. Additionally, there are viruses (Table III) , such as West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus and Western and Eastern equine encephalitis virus, with certain geographic distribution and their differential diagnosis should be taken into account in cases of children, who have travelled in susceptible areas (91, 92) . According to the recent data from the Paediatric Intensive care Unit (PICU) of the 'Aglaia Kyriakou' Children's Hospital (88) in Athens, Greece, among 29 children with cNS infection admitted to the PIcU during the past 5 years, 17 patients (59%) had a viral infection; however, a certain aetiological factor was detected in only 6 of these patients (4 cases with influenza, 1 case with enterovirus and 1 case with HHV-7), whereas 2 patients suffered from autoimmune encephalitis.
All patients with suspected cNS infection should undergo lumbar puncture (LP) unless this is contraindicated due to raised intracranial pressure. Investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) include the total and differential white cell count, red cell count, microscopy, culture, protein, glucose, lactate and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for HSV-1 and HSV-2, VZV, enteroviruses and other possible pathogens depending on the clinical features (92, 93) . Neuroimaging, a CT scan or preferably MRI, should be performed as soon as possible. An MRI performed within 48 h of admission is abnormal in approximately 90% of patients, with some lesions being specific of certain aetiological factors (93) . An electroencephalogram (EEG) is considered if seizures are suspected.
All patients with suspected viral encephalitis start treatment with acyclovir and if the PCR test is positive for HSVs or VZV, should continue treatment for at least 14-21 days (93) . corticosteroids can also be used, although their role remains controversial as they have strong immunomodulatory effects, which may facilitate viral replication. Enterovirus infection requires only supportive care and in more severe cases intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) alone or in combination with high doses of corticosteroids (90) . Other drugs, such as oseltamivir or ganciclovir, are administered according to the underlying viral cause. Viral CNS infections are a life-threatening emergency. Supportive care is crucial and includes airway management, cardiorespiratory support, the maintenance of fluids and electrolyte balance and the management of seizures, according to specific guidelines (94) . Approximately 30% of patients require PICU admission. The overall mortality rates range from 0 to 7%, depending on the pathogen, age and clinical and laboratory findings at the time of presentation. Approximately 35% of survivors will suffer from some form of permanent disability (seizures, learning problems, motor deficits, developmental delay) with much a higher incidence, two thirds of patients, in HSV encephalitis cases.
Asthma has been considered for >30 years as the most common chronic disease in childhood (95, 96) ; the role of allergy in its development is indeed very significant (97) . Other risk factors that have also been associated with the pathogenesis of asthma include prematurity, parental history of asthma, reduced lung size and function, chronic lung disease, neuromuscular or cardiovascular disease, the male sex, low socioeconomic status, down syndrome, intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure and passive smoking, daycare attendance, early exposure to pets, as well as viral respiratory tract infections in infancy (96, (98) (99) (100) . Among these factors, infections, such as acute viral bronchiolitis, caused by RSV and RV in particular, have been recogni",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ed as one of the most significant predictive markers for the development of asthma in later childhood to young adulthood (99) (100) (101) (102) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RSV is a common cause of wheezing that seems to dominate in the first year of an infant's life, during the winter period, causing mainly acute bronchiolitis, while RV is being detected as a causative agent for acute bronchiolitis and lower tract viral infections in older infants and children (103) . It remains to be clarified though, whether it is the specific viral respiratory infection that plays the causative role in asthmatogenesis or whether viral-induced wheezing is just a marker of predisposed individuals for the subsequent development of asthma (104) . It has been well demonstrated that there is an interaction of host factors with viral respiratory infections that promote recurrent virus-induced wheezing and the subsequent development of asthma (101) . The synergistic interaction between allergies and viruses can be explained via various mechanisms, such as interferon deficiency, Th2-biased immunity, defective anti-inflammatory response, airway hyper responsiveness and reduced barrier function (97, 103) . In a recent randomised trial of 429 high-risk infants, treatment with palivizumab of otherwise healthy preterm infants in order to avoid a serious RSV infection was associated with decreased recurrent wheezing rate when compared with the placebo group (105) . RSV causes cyto- pathic damage to the airway epithelium and by that can affect the function of the epithelium and airway smooth muscle (100) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To date, there is increasing evidence to indicate that RV, the most frequent cause of the common cold in children, can replicate in the lower respiratory tract and can cause exacerbations of asthma (97, 103) . Certain features of infection with RV, including the stimulation of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and eotaxin production; the immigration of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, macrophages and neutrophils); and subsequent increases in factors considered important for airway remodeling (such as NO and vascular endothelial growth factor), point to the likelihood that RV infection is asthmatogenic (106) . Given the burden of asthma, it is of utmost importance that future scientific attempts reveal in detail the causality between viral infections and asthmatogenesis. Thus, better asthma-predictive indices can be developed and more effective strategies for asthma prevention can be scheduled, including research for effective vaccines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
during the 1937 and 1938 American excavations of the Agora, in Athens, a well was excavated that was found to contain a minimum of 459 infant and fetal skeletons (107) (108) (109) . Although excavated 70 years ago, the details of its contents were never published. As estimated from long bone lengths, the age of the infants ranged from 26 weeks in utero to 6 months post-term, with a peak at 38-40 weeks (110) . The cause of death for the infants in the Agora's well has been the topic of much speculation over the past 70 years. Suggestions have included war-related famine or epidemic disease, human sacrifice and large-scale infanticide. One of the goals of this project was to evaluate the evidence for pathologies in the infants in order to evaluate the causes of death. Infant death rates from natural causes in the ancient world were very high, and up to 50% of neonates may have died early in the postnatal period (111) . In addition, approximately 15% of these skeletons are from infants born pre-term, as young as 26 weeks in utero. Many of these were probably either stillborn or died from complications associated with prematurity, including respiratory distress and problems with thermoregulation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cranial bones provide evidence for pathologies and possible infectious causes of death. Most of the lesions are diffuse areas of new bone formed on the endocranial surface. The cruciate eminence of the occipital bone was the most common location for endocranial reactive bone in the infants, and this corresponds to the findings in other ancient and modern skeletal collections. Lesions have also been identified on the parietal and frontal bones, often in areas of venous drainage. The greater wing and body of the sphenoid bone also exhibited endocranial proliferative bone lesions. It has been found that that lesions extending beyond the cruciate eminence of the occipital, and hair-on-end lesions are more likely to be pathological, rather than indicative of than normal bone growth (112) . More than 30% of the occipital squamae in this collection exhibited clear pathological bone deposits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Infections and birth-related trauma are thought to have caused most of these lesions. Infections of the meninges are thought to activate the periosteal membrane, resulting in new bone deposition, but the exact mechanism is not clear (112) . Infectious pathogens were commonly introduced through cutting the umbilical cord, and through cultural and dietary practices. It is likely that infants in ancient Athens suffered from the same array of viral infections to which modern infants are prone, including HSV, influenza virus, corona virus, enterovirus, EBV and arbovirus (113) . The perinatal period in ancient Athens was perilous, with considerable risk from viral and bacterial infections. The skeletons from this well provide a brief glimpse into the short lives and early deaths of the youngest Athenians.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Continuing medical education in Paediatric Virology. To provide the optimal care to paediatric patients, a paediatrician should commit to lifelong learning (114) , following the quote by the Athenian Solon (640-558 Bc), one of the Seven Wise Men of Ancient Greece, 'I grow old learning something new every day' (γηράσκω δ' αἰεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενος) (115). To date, the importance of continuing medical education (cME), also known as continuing medical development (cMd), has been recognised as a method of improving the quality of paediatric care by several paediatric organisations and institutions, such as the European Academy of Paediatrics (116) and the RCPCH (117) . It is a professional responsibility for all practicing paediatricians to maintain, develop and increase their knowledge, clinical skills and professional performance with an aim to enhance their clinical effectiveness and competence (118) (119) (120) (121) (122) . Paediatric Virology is indeed a new educational challenge with rapidly increasing and changing educational needs and preferences (123) . This is fostered by several developments in the fields of Clinical Virology and Molecular Medicine, emerging viral diseases as well as technical innovations, which have expanded our diagnostic and therapeutic approaches towards neonatal and paediatric viral infections.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The feedback received from the participants of the 1st and the 2nd Workshop on Paediatric Virology held in 2015 and 2016, respectively, in Athens, highlighted the need for CME (114) . cME in Paediatric Virology must not only emphasise the acquisition of knowledge, but also instruct paediatricians in the process of decision making. Self-directed learning activity should be encouraged; however, CME in Paediatric Virology should also instill collegiality, interaction and collaboration between disciplines. Without a doubt, Paediatric Virologists should have a leading role in cME in Paediatric Virology focusing on academic excellence and state-of-the-art medical education of practicing paediatricians. Further discussion is required on how different educational activities, such as on-line learning, interactive case-based workshops and creation of educational e-platforms, can increase their potential worth for the promotion of Peadiatrics and Public Health. cytology at the University of Florida, USA and academic student of Dr George N.

146,bc47c74ccb7b9751aaa0fa71dd6b6a8265fdbc2c,"Current data indicate that the ""bronchiolitis"" diagnosis comprises more than one condition. Clinically, pathophysiologically, and even genetically three main clusters of patients can be identified among children suffering from severe bronchiolitis (or first wheezing episode): (a) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced bronchiolitis, characterized by young age of the patient, mechanical obstruction of the airways due to","Bronchiolitis is most often described as a virus-induced inflammation of small bronchioles and their surrounding tissue. According to different guidelines, its upper age limit varies from 6 or 12 months, 12 months being preferred by many European countries, to 2 years, used in the United States 1-3 Clinically, bronchiolitis is characterized by expiratory breathing difficulty in infants.
Other symptoms include cough, tachypnea, hyperinflation, chest retraction, widespread crackles, and wheezing. Wheezing is generally not a mandatory criterion. Instead, it is a descriptive term, defined as a whistling sound during expiration, often accompanied by dyspnea. It can be caused by obstruction at any level of the lower airways. However, when bilateral/polyphonic, inflammation is probable.
Bronchiolitis presents a huge clinical burden. Depending on the definitions, the prevalence of bronchiolitis has been between 18% and 32% in the first and 9% and 17% in the second year of life. 2, 3 At the same time, the overall risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma is 70% before school-age and 50% during school years. 1, 4 However, patient characteristics and the risk of asthma strongly vary inside the bronchiolitis cohort thus revealing different disease entities, some of which have a markedly high risk of subsequent asthma development.
To that end, we propose a differentiation of bronchiolitis subtypes by specific viruses and a broad inclusion of children by extending the upper age limit from 6 or 12 months up to 2 years. Recent data clearly indicate that the two major viral causes of bronchiolitis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), have distinct genetics, pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical characteristics, and responses to treatments both regarding short-and long-term outcomes. 1, [5] [6] [7] Thus, a general bronchiolitis diagnosis should be revisited, as the identification of different viruses associated with severe bronchiolitis should improve our understanding of the disease and open avenues for precision medicine.
By definition, bronchiolitis is a virus infection, and PCR diagnostics has reached a 100% virus detection rate in severe bronchiolitis. 8 RSV is the most important causative agent of bronchiolitis during infancy, and it has been detected in 50%-80% of the hospitalized bronchiolitis cases (Figure 1 ). 9,10 RV is the second most common viral agent of bronchiolitis during infancy, but it starts to dominate virus detection after 12 months (Figure 1 ). The next most common viruses in connection to bronchiolitis are human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus followed by parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and influenza virus ( Figure 1 ). Virus coinfections, mostly with RSV and RV, occur in 10%-40% of the severe cases, but reports on their clinical significancy are inconclusive. 9, 10 Respiratory syncytial virus belonging to the Pneumovirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus with two antigenically different A and B subtypes with 11 and 23 genotypes, respectively. 11 Although severe reinfections have been reported in young children, they are generally mild. 12 Main risk factors for RSV bronchiolitis include prematurity, chronic lung disease (low lung function), congenital heart disease, other underlying medical conditions, and young age (1-6 months of age), that is, conditions in which excessive mucus in the airways is problematic, as well as deficient interferon responses. 2 Rhinovirus belonging to the Enterovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family is a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus, and it comprises a genetically diverse group of viruses. It has three distinct subgroups, A, B, and C, which consist of 83, 32, and 55 genotypes,
respectively. 1, 13 This antigenic diversity presents a major challenge when establishing protective immunity and developing vaccines. 14 Risk factors for RV-induced bronchiolitis include T helper 2 polarized immune responses, allergen exposure, impaired epithelial barrier, deficient interferon responses, and diminished lung function. 1,15
Acute bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis that requires epidemiological and virological data. In infants, few days of runny nose, fever, and cough typically precede the signs of lower respiratory distress (nasal flaring, tachypnea, and subcostal recessions) ( Figure 2 ). 1,2 In such a case, respiratory crackles are suggestive of RVS etiology, whereas bilateral wheezing is suggestive of RV etiology. 16 A plethora of other respiratory sounds can also be heard.
Most infants with bronchiolitis present a mild clinical form that usually resolves in 1-2 weeks and can be safely managed at home by well-instructed parents. Adequate information concerning the signs of deterioration (including low oxygen saturations) and the need for urgent transfer to hospital is of critical importance.
It is still not clear whether the type of virus detected in the nasopharynx could determine the degree of severity of the infection.
Most often RSV infection has been linked to more severe ""nonwheezy"" bronchiolitis, need for possible intensive care unit admission, and prolonged duration of stay. 17, 18 However, in 2002, a Greek case-control study showed that RV detected in the upper airways could be strongly associated with episodes of increased severity. 19 Other viruses have been less often linked to severe illness.
Since the early 1990s, there have been several efforts toward developing clinical severity scoring tools for bronchiolitis. From the Severity Scoring Tool to Tal and modified Tal scoring tools, there have been several instruments validated and used both in research and in clinical management settings. 20, 21 However, there is no tool developed to assess both clinical severity and quality of life parameters for these children.
Apart from using merely clinical severity scores, attempts have been made in order to cluster acute bronchiolitis by phenotype. In 2016, four such phenotypes were introduced in two large multicenter studies: Profile A was characterized by RV etiology, history of wheezing, wheezing at presentation, eczema, and older age of the patient; profile B by RSV etiology, wheezing at presentation, but no history of wheezing or eczema; profile C was the most severely ill group, with a longer hospital stay and high probability of RSV infections and intensive care unit treatments; and profile D had the least severe illness, including non-wheezing children with a shorter length of hospitalization. 18 The heterogeneity apparent in the clinical profiles of the patients highlights the need for a more personalized approach in the diagnostics and management of this condition.
While RSV and RV are both common environmental exposures, severe bronchiolitis is relatively rare. It therefore seems likely that host factors such as genetics, are important risk factors as well. Unfortunately, the current understanding of genetic risk factors of bronchiolitis is limited. A twin study estimated the heritability of RSV 
Respiratory syncytial virus-induced bronchiolitis and rhinovirus-induced first wheezing episode are the main clusters of severe bronchiolitis in less than 2-year-old children. It is important to distinguish these overlapping patient groups since they differ clinically, pathophysiologically, and genetically and are likely to respond to different treatments. The first episode of severe bronchiolitis appears to be a critical event and an opportunity for designing secondary prevention strategies for asthma.
bronchiolitis to be only 16%, 22 whereas the estimated heritability of asthma is more than 50%. 23 At present, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including replication of identified loci, are the preferred method for gene discovery, but only one, relatively small, GWAS of bronchiolitis have been performed without genome-wide significant findings. 24 A number of susceptibility genes have been suggested from candidate gene studies.
Most studies focused on RSV bronchiolitis, and the reported associations include genes related to immune regulation and surfactant proteins. 25 Several of these genes have also been associated with asthma, 25 suggesting that the association between RSV bronchiolitis and later asthma development might partly be explained by shared genetics. 1, 18 Nevertheless, bronchiolitis is a poorly defined and highly heterogeneous disease entity with variability in clinical presentation, age at infection, and triggering factors, as well as in the underlying genetic mechanisms. For example, it would be expected that RV bronchiolitis in older children, 18 a phenotype also characterized by a higher risk of asthma predisposition, would also have a higher degree of shared heritability with asthma.
The strongest asthma locus discovered to date, 17q21, has also been found to be associated with wheezing during the early years of life. 26 Furthermore, there is an interaction between this locus and early wheezing in relation to the risk of later asthma. Wheezing episodes during the early years of life are a much stronger risk factor for asthma in children with 17q21 risk variants than in children without it, and this seems more pronounced for episodes triggered by RV than RSV. 26 Another asthma gene with a putative role in bronchiolitis is the cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3). This gene was first discovered as a susceptibility gene for early childhood asthma with recurrent severe exacerbations. 27 Only later was it suggested from experimental studies that CDHR3 also functions as an RV-C receptor. 28 This was subsequently confirmed clinically in the COPSAC and COAST birth cohort studies where the CDHR3 risk variant was specifically associated with early life respiratory episodes triggered by RV-C. 29 In line with this, a meta-analyses of CDHR3 polymorphism in relation to bronchiolitis an association with non-RSV bronchiolitis, which is likely to be triggered by RV, while there was no association with RSV bronchiolitis. 30 
The complex communities of microbes inhabiting all parts of the human body are collectively termed the microbiome. This immense microbial environment has the potential for stimulating the developing immune system, 31 as well as act as a disease modifier. The link between microbiome and susceptibility to bronchiolitis and subsequent asthma has been explored both regarding the airway and the gut microbiome, but the mechanisms behind the possible effects remain to be fully understood.
As it comes to the microbiome of the airways, a diverse microbiological continuity exists between upper and lower airways. 32 The dramatic development of the microbiome of the airways begins at birth and is influenced by factors such as siblings, day-care attendance, antibiotics, and prior infections ( Figure 3 ). 33, 34 It has been speculated whether this low biomass compartment will obtain a steady colonization pattern over time. Recent studies have suggested that certain microbial colonization patterns prevalent already in early childhood may affect the risk of bronchiolitis and precede the development of persistent wheeze or asthma. 35 Furthermore, the severity of the acute respiratory infections may be modulated by the type of microbial community in the airways independent of RSV or RV coinfection, while at the same time, both RSV and RV may increase the severity of the infection independent of the bacteria. 34 It has also been shown that antibiotic treatment during acute wheezing episodes in childhood greatly decreases the duration of the symptoms, thus pointing toward microbial effects. 36 Likewise, a study of 1005 infants demonstrated that certain airway microbiota profiles seemed to increase the severity of bronchiolitis. 37 The rate of intensive care use and the length of hospital stay during the episode of acute bronchiolitis were particularly high in infants with a Haemophilus-dominant profile but low in infants with a Moraxella-dominant profile. This, although low in statistical power, was especially apparent in children with RSV bronchiolitis but not found for RV bronchiolitis. In a small randomized trial of 40 children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis, treatment with azithromycin during the acute episode seemed to alleviate the subsequent risk of long-term respiratory morbidity. 38 The microbiome of the human gut is shaped by an extensive Interactions between the two in bronchiolitis episodes may determine the severity various common as well as distinct unique pathogenic mechanisms.
Typically, as a result of innate immune activation, an early burst of type I/III interferons will occur rapidly after respiratory viral infection. This will be followed by an induction of cytokines, including alarmins, chemokines, and growth factors that activate and attract innate lymphoid cells, granulocytes, dendritic cells, and monocytes to the site of infection. 1, 41, 42 The combined effect of the virus and the inflammatory response leads to epithelial cell apoptosis, necrosis, and epithelial sloughing, as well as mucus overproduction. However, while RSV infections can lead to severe lower respiratory tract infection primarily in very young children, RV infections tend to result in severe wheezing in slightly older children, those with atopic predisposition in particular. 1 In order to understand these differences, we need a better insight into the immunological events in the lungs in as a response to these early respiratory infections. 42,43
The initial response of the mucosa to RSV infection is a strong induction of antiviral type I and type III interferons and interferoninduced genes ( Figure 4A ). As RSV has developed potent mechanisms to evade this innate interferon response, the virus is able to infect most infants through RSV-NS1/2 proteins inhibiting IRF-3 and
suppressing IRF-1 through EGRF activation. [44] [45] [46] [47] While severe RSV bronchiolitis is associated with weaker antiviral innate interferon responses, data on the association between virus genome load and illness severity are discrepant. 47, 48 Furthermore, ineffective inflammatory and adaptive immune responses are important factors that contribute to severe RSV disease. As at birth the immune system is still immature and needs to develop, it depends mostly on the innate immune system in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) ligation and maternal-derived antibodies. At the same time, pro-inflammatory innate immune responses are not very prominent as anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, prevail since during pregnancy mother's immune system protects the fetus. 49 As a consequence, T helper 1 (Th1) cell skewing cytokines such as IL-12 seem to develop rather slowly in young infants, even in the presence of TLR-ligating viruses and increased type I interferon production. 50, 51 Interestingly, the cytokines IL-6 and IL-23, both potent inducers of IL-17-producing T cells, were found to be increased in TLR-stimulated neonatal cells and neonates were shown to have increased numbers of Th 17 cells ( Figure 4A ). 52 As enhanced pathology following RSV infections is often associated with increased IL-17 production and this cytokine is more prominent in neonates, the presence of this cytokine may contribute to a more severe disease state. 53, 54 In addition, studies in neonatal mice have shown that there is a spontaneous early wave of innate cytokines such as IL-33, a Th 2 skewing cytokine, and a recruitment of innate lymphoid cells (ILC)-2 into the lungs that reach the maximum at day 14 after birth. 55, 56 Therefore, age-specific events in neonatal lungs seem to naturally support the initial development of Th 2 immune responses that combined with a yet ineffective activation of innate immunity and IL-17 being upregulated in young infants, drive mucus hyperproduction and the promotion of severe pathology during early RSV infections. 57 In addition, B-cell function is not yet developed in very young infants (<6 months of age) and it takes more time to generate a sufficient and sustained antibody production. As at very early phase, babies still rely on maternal antibodies, babies born from a mother with high circulating neutralizing antibodies are better protected from severe diseases. 58 This notion has led to the idea of developing a vaccine for RSV that targets pregnant mothers instead of young children. Thus, through vaccinating the mothers, the children would be provided with an increased transfer of protective maternal antibodies against RSV. 59,60
Rhinoviruses also directly target airway epithelial cells. RV type A frequently causes lower respiratory tract infection, and RV type C in particular is linked to severe wheezing in infected children. 8, 13, 61 The increased risk of severe RV infection with wheeze in young children with a strong family history of allergy and asthma may be explained by a partial defect in mucosal antiviral innate interferon responses, due potentially to early allergic airways inflammation ( Figure 4B ).
The airway mucosa of asthmatics, who have allergic airway inflammation, has been shown to be associated with reduced type I and type III interferon responses. 62, 63 To understand the particularly high pathogenic potential of RV-C, it is important to note that CDHR3 has recently been identified as a unique receptor for RV-C. 18 Interestingly, a polymorphism in the CDHR3 gene (resulting in a higher expression of CDHR3 on the epithelial surface) was associated with the increased risk of childhood asthma. 27 RV-C has also evolved specific molecular tools to reduce IFN-β expression and downstream signaling in airway epithelial cells, 64 which may possibly explain the more severe course of respiratory RV-C infections. In addition, RV infections of airway epithelial cells are strong inducers of type 2 innate cytokines, such as IL-25 and IL-33, which subsequently initiate or boost type 2 immunity in the lungs via IL-5-and IL-13-producing innate lymphoid cells (ILC) 2 and Th 2 cells ( Figure 4B) . Surprisingly, the induction of innate cytokines by RV infections was stronger in airway epithelial cells from asthmatics compared to healthy controls. 65 Also, the induction of type 2 innate cytokines may be more pronounced during early childhood, as compared to adult mice, human rhinovirus infections in neonatal mice showed more pronounced IL-13 and IL-25 expression, mucus secretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness. 66 This process may be further boosted or coinciding by an early spontaneous wave of IL-33-dependent type 2 cytokines and cells in developing lungs of neonatal mice. 55, 56 Overall, although RV infections are linked to the induction of milder epithelial inflammation than RSV infections, they tend to reduce type I IFN expression and cause inflammation with Th 2 cell characteristics, disrupted tight junction expression, and high cytokine levels that promote bronchospasm, edema, and mucus production and lead to airway obstruction and wheeze. 1 supportive treatment, that is, oxygen, nasal suctioning, mechanical ventilation, and hydration. 67 High flow oxygen therapy using nasal cannula has shown promising results. 68 There is conflicting information across clinical guidelines about the role of nebulized hypertonic saline in acute management of bronchiolitis. Only a few current guidelines recommend bronchodilators. 2 Overall, corticosteroids (see details below), nebulized epinephrine, or antibiotics are not recommended. 2 Because of the current frustration with the existing treatment modalities (high use of bronchodilators, antibiotics, and corticosteroids) and as the majority of the previous trials have not been based on virus-specific data, is further research required in order to direct focus to more personalized management plans in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. 69 
Palivizumab: Immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV F glycoprotein, decreases the risk of hospitalization due to severe RSV illness among preterm infants (72% reduction), those with chronic lung disease (65% reduction), and hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (53% reduction). 60 Interestingly, palivizumab has effectively reduced recurrent wheezing following hospitalization due to RSV, but not asthma. 70 Ribavirin: Convincing data supporting ribavirin treatment for severe RSV infection are lacking, and its toxicity remains a concern. Therefore, ribavirin is not recommended in the current U.S. guidelines. 71 New treatments: There are currently approximately 28 RSV vaccines and antibodies in preclinical development and another 17 in clinical development. 59 
There are only a few agents targeting the inhibition of the attachment of RV to the cell or uncoating viral RNA, and their clinical applicability is continuously questioned due to adverse events (pleconaril, vapendavir) or drug resistance (amantadine, rimantadine). 72, 73 Prednisolone: In two separate randomized trials, oral corticosteroid, prednisolone, has been shown to increase the time to the physician-confirmed relapse within the following year by 20%-30%
and to the initiation of asthma controller medication within the following 5 years by 30%-40% in first-time wheezing children with RV etiology. These results point out that early systemic anti-inflammatory control targeting the pre-existing and/or virus-induced airway inflammatory response could significantly affect the natural course of asthma. [74] [75] [76] [77] Interestingly, all wheezing children with high RV genome load treated with placebo developed a new physician-confirmed wheezing episode within 100 days and initiation of asthma control medication within 14 months. 76, 77 In conclusion, according to our hypothesis regarding the various entities of bronchiolitis, we emphasize that effective treatment of bronchiolitis should be administered on a more personalized base than currently in practice and include various viral etiological factors.
We do believe that existing treatment methods (beta 2 -agonists and corticosteroids) can be effective given the assumption that they are intended for a distinct (RV-affected) high-risk group of patients.
However, there is an urgent and unmet need for new guidelines which would recognize this discrepancy and for clinicians to understand that there is no more ""common bronchiolitis.""
Severe acute bronchiolitis experienced early in childhood is associated with an increased risk of asthma that may persist into early adulthood. 1 It remains to be elucidated whether bronchiolitis is the cause of lung injury that results in subsequent wheezing episodes and asthma development or whether there is an inherent predisposition to both acute bronchiolitis and latter asthma, with bronchiolitis being an early marker of this predisposition. Regardless of possible underlying lung morbidity, the major viral causes of acute bronchiolitis/first wheeze, RSV and RV, seem to have a different course in post-bronchiolitis asthma sequela.
Several observational studies have reported an association between RSV-bronchiolitis and subsequent asthma development. For example, according to a population-based study (n = 476) from Tucson, Arizona, and a birth cohort study (n = 150) from Australia, RSVinduced lower respiratory infection/bronchiolitis during early life is modestly associated with recurrent wheezing/doctor-diagnosed asthma at school-age (odds ratio 2.5-4.3) but not with atopy. 78, 79 Similar numbers have also been found in preterm infants. 80 Only a small cohort study from Sweden has shown an association between RSV-bronchiolitis and later allergic sensitization as well as asthma; by the age 18, 41% of the RSV children were allergic and 39% had asthma compared to the 17% and 9% in the control group, respectively. 81 To address the potential causality between RSV infection and subsequent asthma, prospective studies with RSV-immunoprophylaxis have been performed. Two recent randomized controlled trials showed that in preterm infants, palivizumab, an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, decreased the parent-reported recurrent wheeze, but similar incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma at age 6 years was found. 82, 83 Long-term effects of RSV prophylaxis appear less likely in infants with atopic family history. 60 These results clearly indicate that RSV-infection is not causal to the asthma or atopy development.
One potential explanation for these results is that children with RSV infection and subsequent asthma development may share common genetic vulnerability and/or environmental exposures that predispose them to both diseases. 84 JARTTI ET AL.
In contrast to RSV bronchiolitis, atopy has been clearly associated with childhood asthma development after RV-induced early wheezing. High-risk (parental atopy or asthma) birth cohort studies from Wisconsin, United States, and Australia have shown that young children suffering from RV-induced wheezing episodes are at high risk of school-age asthma (odds ratio up to, RV vs RSV, 9.8 vs 2.6). [85] [86] [87] The risk is especially high if children were sensitizated at an age younger than 2 years. 85, 87 A recent study on hospitalized children shows similar results: RV-induced severe first wheezing episode at an age less than 2 years was a risk factor (odds ratio 5.0) for atopic asthma at school-age along with early sensitization and eczema (odds ratios 12 and 4.8, respectively) while RSV was associated with neither atopic nor nonatopic asthma. 7 Therefore, data from these high-risk birth cohorts suggest that atopic airways have an increased susceptibility for asthma development after RV-induced bronchiolitis.
The primary prevention strategies of asthma aim at reducing the incidence of the disease by identifying the individuals at risk and reducing their exposure to the potential risk factors. First, the hygiene hypothesis evolved to cover the environmental microbial burden in general. 88, 89 However, due to recent findings, the scope of the hygiene hypothesis has enlarged to cover the environmental biodiversity in general. Thus, rapid urbanization, pollution, and climate change, all leading to the loss of biodiversity, promote chronic noncommunicable illnesses such as asthma, allergies, diabetes, obesity, and cancer, [90] [91] [92] whereas frequent contact with animal lipopolysaccharides present in all we eat, touch, and breath prevent atopy, allergic rhinitis and sometimes asthma. 90, 92 Second, conditions during pregnancy are important.
Maternal omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) and vitamin D supplementation in the third trimester of pregnancy may reduce the risk of persistent wheeze/asthma and respiratory infections in offspring ( Figure 5 ). 93, 94 Secondary prevention strategies of asthma aim at avoiding the development of allergic disease/asthma in already sensitized or wheezing subjects. 95 Thus far, allergen immunotherapy remains as the only treatment available for modifying the course of allergic disease. 96 However, although in a recent study grass pollen immunotherapy was shown to reduce asthma-like symptoms in children, it did not decrease the development of asthma. 97 Interestingly, though, a systemic anti-inflammatory treatment of the first RV-induced severe wheezing episode markedly decreased the subsequent risk of asthma ( Figure 5) , (see section 7). [74] [75] [76] [77] Also, a
year-round and preseasonal treatment with omalizumab has been shown to eliminate the seasonal peaks in asthma exacerbations, most of which are associated with RV infection. 98 In addition to the reduction in allergic inflammation by preventing IgE binding to its receptor, omalizumab also enhances the IFN-γ response. 99 Thus, it has been argued that omalizumab may improve the antiviral responses. RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab has also been shown to reduce recurrent wheezing (see section 7 and 8). 60, 70, 82, 83 In the development of RV vaccine, promising results have been seen with a cross-reactive recombinant capsid protein in a mouse model. 14 Non-specific antiviral approaches to reduce asthma include strategies aiming at enhancing the patient's resistance to multiple respiratory viruses through the administration of interferons or other immunostimulatory molecules. 72, 73 Strategies (microbial and others) to promote healthy epithelial barrier and the development of mucosal immune responses that can better resist viral infection might also help in preventing the development of asthma, as well as bacterial lysates, which may reduce the recurrent wheezing by increasing antiviral activity. 100 However, the level of evidence still remains to be low.
F I G U R E 5 Major factors influencing asthma risk in young children suffering from bronchiolitis. RV, rhinovirus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; n-3 LCPUFA, n-3 (omega-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids Going forward, it will be important to identify the patients at high risk of asthma and to find the specific primary and secondary prevention strategies for each individual patient ( Figure 5 ), for example, sensitization, eczema, and the first severe wheeze caused by RV appear to predict atopic asthma, while the first severe wheeze before 1-year age, RV/RSV-negative etiology, and/or association with parental smoking appear to predict nonatopic asthma. 7 In conclusion, these new insights into viral virulence, personal risk factors (genetics, allergy, and antiviral immunity), and environmental exposures (farm, urban, microbes, and nutrition) provide hope that in future we might be able to reduce the occurrence of childhood asthma ( Figure 5 ).
Clinically and pathophysiologically, three main clusters of patients can be identified among children suffering from severe bronchiolitis/first wheezing episode ( Figure 6 ): 1) RSV-induced bronchiolitis is characterized by young age of the patient and mechanical obstruction of the airways due to mucus and cell debris. For the treatment of RSV-induced bronchiolitis, there is a prophylactic RSV-specific monoclonal antibody available that decreases the risk of recurrent wheezing. 2) RV-induced wheezing is associated with atopic predisposition and high risk of asthma, which may be reversed with systemic corticosteroid in patients with severe first episode. RV susceptibility, thus, serves as an important early marker for asthma-prone children. 3) Wheeze due to other viruses is likely to be less frequent and severe. Clinically, it is important to distinguish between these three partially overlapping patient groups, as they are likely to respond to different treatments. The first severe episode of bronchiolitis or wheezing in a less than 2-year-old child appears to be a critical event and an important opportunity for designing secondary prevention strategies for asthma. Thus, bronchiolitis cannot simply be diagnosed using a certain cutoff age, but instead, viral etiology should be used as the differentiating factor. For nomenclature, we suggest that there are an RSV-induced bronchiolitis and an RV-induced first wheezing episode to better distinguish these conditions.

148,2aa0a28e4246f367ffe104837e755b28d2021f45,"Background: The natural history and consequences of severe H1N1 influenza infection among cancer patients are not yet fully characterized. We describe eight cases of H1N1 infection in cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a referral cancer center.
Patients and methods: Clinical data from all patients admitted with acute respiratory failure due to novel viral H1N1 infection were reviewed. Lung tissue was submitted for viral and bacteriological analyses by real-time RT-PCR, and autopsy was conducted on all patients who died.
Results: Eight patients were admitted, with ages ranging from 55 to 65 years old. There were five patients with solid organ tumors (62.5%) and three with hematological malignancies (37.5%). Five patients required mechanical ventilation and all died. Four patients had bacterial bronchopneumonia. All deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure. A milder form of lung disease was present in the three cases who survived. Lung tissue analysis was performed in all patients and showed diffuse alveolar damage in most patients. Other lung findings were necrotizing bronchiolitis or extensive hemorrhage.
Conclusions: H1N1 viral infection in patients with cancer can cause severe illness, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. More data are needed to identify predictors of unfavorable evolution in these patients.","Patients with malignancies are more susceptible for acquisition of infections than the general population and are thought to potentially develop more complications [1] . Due to many disruptions in both innate and acquired immunity, even organisms with low virulence potential are able to cause significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients [2] .
During April 2009, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) was identified in California and in Mexico as the cause of human respiratory disease, originating a pandemic [3, 4] . As of February 2010, 700 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of novel H1N1 influenza virus and 14 000 deaths have been reported globally. Most affected patients present with influenza-like symptoms and have a benign course [5] . However, patients with comorbidities as cancer and chronic diseases may show a serious clinical presentation, characterized by respiratory failure with variable severity [6, 7] .
Although the presence of a malignancy is considered to have a negative impact on the H1N1 disease severity, there are few reports on clinical outcomes in cancer patients affected by the disease. Redelman-Sidi et al. [8] recently described a cohort of 45 patients with solid and hematological malignancies with H1N1 infection. From this population, one single patient required intensive care admission and there were no viral infection-related deaths. On the other hand, fatalities have been described in oncologic patients, particularly in the ones with hematological malignancies [9] .
So far, there are no reports describing clinical characteristics of cancer patients with a severe form of the disease. These patients represent a vulnerable population, which require rapid diagnostic work-up and intensive management in specialized units. Therefore, we believe that it would be important to report on the clinical characteristics of cancer patients with a severe form of the H1N1 infection.
During the 2009 Southern Hemisphere H1N1 pandemics, Sao Paulo was among the cities with the highest incidence of disease in Brazil. In this study, we describe the clinical and pathological findings in critically ill patients with cancer and respiratory failure related to novel H1N1 infection admitted to original article an oncologic intensive care unit (ICU) in a reference cancer center in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
This analysis and report was approved by the Institutional Medical Ethical Committee. Clinical and laboratorial data at admission and during ICU stay are described, including the management of respiratory support and nonventilatory strategies. Data for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and for the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) were reported as the worst value within 24 h after ICU admission. A daily evaluation of organ function according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was performed Radiological findings were evaluated through X-ray in all patients and computerized tomography when appropriate.
The in vivo diagnosis of H1N1 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) test using nasopharyngeal swab specimens, in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [10] .
autopsies Five patients who died had their autopsies performed in the Department of Pathology of the Universidade de Sao Paulo. The pathological findings on part of this population have been previously described by our group [11] .
Tissue fragments were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and hematoxylin-eosin stained. For lung sections, Grocott, Brown-Hopps and Ziehl-Neelsen stainings were performed for the identification of fungi, bacteria and acid-fast bacilli, respectively. Lung fragments were sent for microbiological investigation using rRT-PCR to the Instituto Adolfo Lutz in Sao Paulo. Seasonal influenza A and swine influenza A detection was performed using the CDC protocol [10] . The RT-PCR test used for bacteria identified DNA from Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
results baseline characteristics Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the eight patients. Patient ages ranged from 55 to 65 years (median, 58 years). Four patients (50%) were male. All patients (100%) had preexisting medical conditions other than the neoplasm. Most of the patients presented no functional impairment before the infection-seven patients (87.5%) had Karnofsky scale >70.
Five patients (62.5%) had solid neoplasms and three patients (37.5%) had hematological malignancies. Two patients had been submitted to chemotherapy in the last 4 weeks (Table 1) . However, most patients were considered as having active disease regarding cancer status (seven patients, 87.5%). Four patients (50%) had metastatic disease. The patient with myelofibrosis had been submitted to stem-cell transplantation 1 year ago. All patients presented cough and fever, most patients had myalgia and dyspnea (87.5%). Hemoptysis, rhinorrhea and wheezing were present in 25% and diarrhea was related by 12.5% of patients.
At admission, all patients presented with signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, defined as two or more of the signs and symptoms described in Table 2 . All patients had fever or hypothermia and tachypnea. Leukocytosis was present in 75% of cases. At admission, only two patients were hypotensive (25%). However, hypoxemia was present in 100% of cases, and four patients (50%) had oxygen saturation <90% at admission (Table 2) . Initially, lung disease was in most cases localized in one or two quadrants of lung (75%). However, most patients developed a more extensive and progressive In all the eight patients, the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) could be established based on the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PO 2 /FiO 2 ) £200 and no clinical evidence for an elevated left atrial pressure. Due to rapidly progressive hypoxemia (PO 2 /FiO 2 117) and the rapid worsening of lung infiltrates (Figure 1 ), five patients (62.5%) needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Four patients were intubated in the first 24 h of ICU and one patient 48 h after unsuccessful noninvasive ventilation (NIV). NIV was successfully used in three patients (37.5%), who had milder forms of disease as showed by a computerized tomography that revealed sparse bilateral infiltrate ( Figure 2 ).
Patients who needed mechanical ventilation were managed with pressure-cycled ventilation, with a low tidal volume (target 6 ml/kg) open-lung strategy of ventilation, and a positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) titrated based on FiO 2 for goal plateau pressure (Pplat) < 30 cm H 2 O and SpO 2 88%-90% according to ARDS Network protocol. In some cases, due to refractory hypoxemia, PEEP levels of 14 to 16 cm H 2 O were applied. In all patients, recruitment maneuvers were usedcontinuous positive airway pressure 35-40 cm H 2 O for 30 swith short-term improvements in oxygenation in three of five patients (initial mean oxygen saturation rate increased from 88% to 94%). Neuromuscular blockade was used in two patients ( Table 2) . Despite the aforementioned ventilatory strategy, this particular group of patients developed refractory persistent hypoxemia. Lung mechanics of patients showed very low static and dynamic compliance and high airway resistance.
Most patients presented risk scores that predicted high-risk mortality (APACHE II 24 and SAPS II 52). Respiratory failure was the most commonly encountered dysfunction, followed by cardiovascular, renal and hematological failures. Two patients needed dialysis. Most patients needed vasopressor and inotropic drugs. Patients presented with a serious, rapidly Oseltamivir was initiated early in all patients. Corticosteroids were administered in all patients admitted in the ICU, at a dose of methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day. Antibiotics were empirically administered in all patients due to clinical suspicion of bacterial coinfection. Despite early treatment, these patients had a high mortality rate, with five deaths (62.5%). The median period from admission to death was 3 days (1-8). Interestingly, three patients who died showed persistent positive rRT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs after 5 days of oseltamivir. Hematological evaluation showed leukocytosis (median 16 100/mm 3 ) and anemia (median hemoglobin 9.3 g/dl) in majority of cases. Also, signs of tissue hypoxia as acidosis (median pH 7.2), high levels of lactate (median 4.2 mmol/l) and low levels of base excess (median 4.5 mEq/l) were noted in patients since admission until death. Reactive protein-C ranged from 99 to 447, revealing inflammatory response associated or not with coinfection (Table 3) .
During evolution, bacterial coinfection was diagnosed in seven patients: Staphylococcus aureus in blood stream in one patient, urinary tract infection due to Enterococcus faecalis in one patient and pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one case and due to S. pneumoniae in four other cases. Also, one patient presented urinary tract infection due to Candida. An autopsy was performed in the five patients who died, and a summary of the findings is presented in Table 4 .
All patients presented extensive pathological alterations in the lungs; lungs were heavy, diffusely edematous and with variable degrees of hemorrhage. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was present in most of the patients, but as previously described, there were three distinct patterns of pulmonary pathological changes [11, 12] : (i) four patients had classic exudative DAD, with alveolar and interstitial edema, hyaline membranes and reactive pneumocytes; (ii) one patient (esophagus neoplasm) had DAD and severe necrotizing bronchiolitis (NB) characterized by extensive necrosis of the bronchiolar wall and dense neutrophilic infiltrate within the bronchiolar lumen and (iii) one patient (myelofibrosis) presented with exudative DAD with an intense hemorrhagic component (Figure 3 ). Only one of the five patients did not present acute interstitial changes. In this patient with esophageal cancer, death was secondary to pulmonary thromboembolism and bacterial pneumonia. Two patients had pulmonary thromboembolism (two patients with esophagus neoplasm). In four of five patients, bronchopneumonia coinfection due to S. pneumoniae was confirmed at autopsy ( Figure 3) .
Metastatic disease was present in all patients with solid neoplasms, and two of those had lung involvement by tumor. All patients had atrophic or nonreactive white pulp in the spleen (Figure 3 ). In the lymph nodes, nonreactive follicles and sinusoidal erythrophagocytosis were found. The liver showed erythrophagocytosis and a few mononuclear inflammatory cells in the sinusoids in all patients and variable degrees of shockrelated centrilobular necrosis. The bone marrow was hypocellular in four of five patients. All patients had mild/ moderate kidney acute tubular necrosis. No patient had histological signs of encephalitis, myocarditis or myositis.
We report the clinical and pathological findings from eight patients with cancer and severe H1N1 infection who were admitted to an oncologic ICU during the winter period of the 2009 pandemic in Sao Paulo, Brazil. These patients were characterized by having active malignant disease, comorbidities and difficult to manage rapidly progressive acute respiratory failure.
Viral infections may represent up to 26% of the infections identified in cancer patients with pulmonary infiltrates. In a large study examining viral infections in hematological cancer patients, pneumonia was observed in 31% of the cases, and the overall mortality was 15% [12] . In this study, influenza A was the most common isolated agent, and the only independent predictor of fatal outcome was an absolute lymphocyte count £200 cells/ml.
Clinical outcomes in cancer patients with H1N1 infection have not been fully characterized yet. Due to potential severity of H1N1 infection in this group of patients, Crawford et al. [13] recommended during the 2009 pandemic that patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy and develop fever should be admitted to a hospital and receive oseltamivir after swab collection. In addition, patients with febrile neutropenia should be treated according to the usual protocol with the addition of oseltamivir.
Kharfan-Dabaja et al. [14] first reported H1N1 infection in two allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients. In one case, the patient presented with fever, myalgia, sore throat and diarrhea without evidence of hypoxemia or lung progressive infiltrates. After treatment with oseltamivir, ciprofloxacin and doxycicline, the symptoms resolved without sequelae. In the second case, pulmonary symptomatology continued to deteriorate despite aggressive polymicrobial treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation and ultimately the patient died from respiratory failure [14] . Redelman-Sidi et al. [8] recently described 45 patients with cancer and/or hematological conditions and H1N1 infection at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, with no reports of mortality or serious morbidities. In this report, only one patient was admitted in the ICU and did not need mechanical ventilation. In these patients with cancer, mortality was very high. The differences in outcomes may be related to specific characteristics of our population, including high prevalence of metastatic disease, comorbidities and high incidence of bacterial coinfection. Differently from the MSKCC experience [8] , most patients in our series initially presented with signs and symptoms of lung disease-hypoxemia, dyspnea and tachypnea-instead of only influenza symptoms.
The serious clinical presentation of the novel Influenza A (H1N1) infection in some cancer patients should be expected. Patients with cancer now live longer and immunosupression from malignant disease or its treatment renders many susceptible to infections [15] . Indeed, most of the patients in this series developed bacterial coinfections. The altered immunological response of these patients may contribute to the original article Annals of Oncology development of more severe forms of disease. In our study, three cases still excreted virus after 5 days in the ICU, as already reported [16] . Prolonged periods of viral shedding could be associated to disease severity [17] and perhaps with an oseltamivir-resistant strain of the virus [18] . Respiratory failure occurred in all patients who required ICU care and was characterized by rapidly progressive bilateral lung infiltrates with refractory hypoxemia and low left atrial pressure-ARDS. Most patients needed mechanical ventilation (five of eight), and they were all treated with protective strategies according to the ARDS Network protocol [19] . In all these patients, recruitment maneuvers were applied, with just transient improvement in oxygenation (initial median oxygen saturation rate increased from 88% to 94%), reflecting the extensive lung involvement of disease. In some cases of severe H1N1 infection, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [20] has been proposed as an alternative support therapy with promising results [21, 22] .
Based on previous cases of H1N1 infection in noncancer patients, Ramsey et al. [6] described a significant proportion of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, specially when associated with comorbidities. Early intubation and admission in the ICU is prudent, given the rapid progression of hypoxemia. Based on current evidence, authors recommend patients should be managed with a low tidal volume open-lung strategy of ventilation, with PEEP titrated based on FiO 2 to achieve adequate SpO 2 and low Pplat [21, 22] .
This strategy was performed in all studied patients of our series; however, despite that there was no adequate response and all patients who required mechanically ventilated died with refractory hypoxemia and multiple organ failure. Similar to our findings, in a Mexican series of S-OIV cases, of 12 patients who needed mechanical ventilation, 7 died [23] .
Three patients presented with a milder form of lung disease, responding well to NIV, and with progressive improvement of hypoxemia. There is some controversy around the clinical Annals of Oncology original article efficacy of NIV in novel influenza A (H1N1) infection. Whereas NIV may be considered as a mode of ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure, there are concerns about its usefulness in an infectious epidemic [24] . In the Canadian experience, 30% of patients were noninvasively ventilated on admission, but 85% of these patients required subsequent intubation and invasive ventilation [6] . In addition, NIV machines have no bacterial or viral filters and do generate aerosols. There are often leaks from the mask, and it has to be removed sometimes for nursing care [24] . During the pandemic, NIV was associated with transmission of disease to health care workers [25] .
In our study, we detected bacterial coinfection in seven of the eight patients. The CDC reported that 29% of fatal cases in the United States presented at least one bacterial coinfection [26] . Mauad et al. [11] found evidence of bacterial coinfection in 38% of fatal cases in Sao Paulo.
The presented incidence of 87% of bacterial coinfection might explain in part the high mortality rate of this group, despite early antimicrobial therapy. Interestingly, biochemical and hematological data could not discriminate H1N1 infection from sepsis of bacterial origin in this group of patients.
Corticosteroids were administered to all patients as Meduri et al. [27] recommend in ARDS cases with low PO 2 /FiO 2 . Steroid use has been reported in some cases of H1N1associated ARDS without any adverse outcome [28] . However, some authors discuss the potential adverse effects of steroids in H1N1 infection, including higher mortality possibly related to virus spreading [29] . Although there is no consensus about its efficacy in this disorder, and despite the belief that corticosteroid could reduce pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in severe cases, our poor results suggest that this strategy will need to be carefully reevaluated in the future.
By performing autopsies in the fatal cases in this population we could determine that the cause of death in all patients was extensive involvement of the lungs and alterations secondary to multiple organ failure in major organs such as kidney and liver [11] . Patients had severe DAD associated with severe NB and alveolar hemorrhage. Further, autopsy results showed that patients had metastatic disease and signs of cellular immunosuppression as depletion of white pump view on spleen analysis. Certainly, autopsies contributed to a better characterization of these patients. This report has some limitations. The unicentric characteristics of the study and the small sample size do not allow for definite conclusions about severe H1N1 presentation in oncologic patients. We characterized H1N1 infection in a selected population of patients with neoplasm, with a high incidence of metastatic disease and who needed ICU care. Our findings certainly describe the most serious presentation of disease.
The importance of describing this serious form of disease in patients with cancer is to reinforce prevention strategies in this group, as to recommend vaccine, hygienic measures, prophylactic antiviral treatment in cases of contact and adequate isolation in cases of hospital admission due to H1N1 infection [30, 31] . Also, a better understanding of clinical and pathological findings in the group of cancer patients could guide ventilator management and nonventilatory strategies to obtain lower rates of mortality.
In summary, our report of cancer patients highlights the severity of the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in this vulnerable population and the urgent need to establish specific protocols of care and management strategies designed to face this health care challenge. funding Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnoló gico (CNPq).",Severe novel influenza A (H1N1) infection in cancer patients,"Hajjar, L.

149,dd0863296aa29156993cde032a4f7f42f5133fff,"To begin to understand why IFN is produced in infected macrophages, we infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and as a control, bone marrowderived DC (BMDC) with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). As expected, BMM but not BMDC expressed type I IFN. IFN production in infected BMM was nearly completely dependent on signaling through the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-␣/␤) receptor (IFNAR). Several IFN-dependent cytokines and chemokines showed the same expression pattern, with enhanced production in BMM compared to BMDC and dependence upon signaling through the IFNAR. Exogenous IFN enhanced IFN-dependent gene expression in BMM at early times after infection and in BMDC at all times after infection but did not stimulate expression of molecules that signal through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Collectively, our results show that IFN is produced at early times postinfection (p.i.) in MHV-infected BMM, but not in BMDC, and primes expression of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. Further, our results also show that BMM are generally more responsive to MHV infection, since MyD88-dependent pathways are also activated to a greater extent in these cells than in BMDC.
This pathway of cellular activation may be a useful target for modulating macrophage function in order to selectively enhance the antivirus immune response and diminish the pathogenic role of these cells in SARS and other coronavirus infections. . 2010. Autocrine interferon priming in macrophages but not dendritic cells results in enhanced cytokine and chemokine production after coronavirus infection. mBio 1(4):","associated proteins, and one to eight accessory proteins (proteins interspersed between or within structural proteins encoded at the 3= end of the genome). SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) accessory proteins ORF3b and ORF6, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) accessory protein ORF5a, MHV and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) proteins and replicase-associated nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and nsp3 are all able to inhibit IFN induction and/or signaling (9-15) (reviewed in reference 16) . In addition, MHV delays IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction by IFN or Sendai virus (SenV) (17) . Further, in some cell types, including fibroblasts and cDC, neither SARS-CoV nor MHV induces IFN expression. However, neither virus is able to prevent IFN induction by other viruses or by poly(I · C), which suggests that these viruses are ""invisible"" to intracellular IFN sensors (18, 19) . This ""passive"" method of immune evasion may occur because coronaviruses replicate on membranous structures, including double-membrane vesicles, thereby limiting exposure of sequestered RNA to innate immune sensors (18) (19) (20) . On first glance, these results appeared to contradict the observation that type I IFNs are detected in MHV-infected mice and in patients with SARS (21, 22) . However, IFN is induced in pDC by a TLR7-and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent pathway, in macrophages and microglia in an MDA5-dependent pathway, and in oligodendrocyte cell lines via MDA5-and RIG-I-dependent pathways (23) (24) (25) . Collectively, these results show that coronaviruses use multiple approaches to evade the innate immune response and that the extent and nature of evasion are cell type dependent. The basis of these cell type-specific differences in IFN expression after coronavirus infection is not well understood.
Both macrophages, in which IFN is induced, and DC, in which IFN is not induced, are important target cells for several coronaviruses. DC in particular are critical for initiation of the antivirus T-and B-cell responses, which are ultimately critical for virus clearance. Infection of DC and macrophages likely contributes to the development of effective innate and adaptive immune responses, but macrophage infection, in the case of some coronaviruses, also contributes to immunopathological disease and enhanced lethality (26, 27) . Macrophage infection has been demonstrated in infected humans or animals (28) (29) (30) , and both types of cells are readily infected with coronaviruses after culture in vitro (24, 31, 32) .
Here, we cultured primary bone marrow (BM) cells in vitro in the presence of cytokines and growth factors, resulting in differentiation into cells with the characteristics of macrophages (BMM, cultured in the presence of macrophage colonystimulating factor [M-CSF]; CD11b ϩ CD11c Ϫ ) or dendritic cells (BMDC, cultured in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] and interleukin-4 [IL-4]; CD11b ϩ CD11c ϩ ). Using these cells, we showed that most of the IFN produced after MHV infection was dependent on signaling through the IFN-␣/␤ receptor (IFNAR). This IFN was critical for virus-induced upregulation of several IFN-related molecules, including MDA5, RIG-I, and CXCL10 (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 10). Further, levels of type I IFN produced in MHVinfected BMM were sufficient to induce maximal activation, since exogenous type I IFN treatment did not further stimulate IFNrelated gene upregulation at late times postinfection (p.i.). Our results also showed that the expression of some inflammationassociated molecules, most notably tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-12, and IL-6, was mediated, in large part, via signaling through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathways.
We previously showed that neither BMDC nor fibroblasts produce type I IFN after infection with the JHM strain of MHV (JHMV), and others have found similar results using the A59 strain (MHV-A59) (18, 19, 23, 33) . For the experiments described here, we used only MHV-A59 (MHV) because this virus grows to high titer and forms syncytia at later times postinfection (p.i.) than JHMV, allowing prolonged cell survival. Roth-Cross et al. showed that BMM produced type I IFN after MHV infection, but only late times p.i. (24 h p.i.) were examined in that initial study (24) . To determine the kinetics of IFN expression, we infected BMM or BMDC with MHV and then measured IFN-␤ mRNA and IFN protein levels at different times p.i. by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and by an IFN bioassay, respectively. Sendai virus (SenV) was included as a positive control, since it is known to induce IFN. SenV-infected BMM rapidly upregulated IFN expression with protein detected as early as 2 h p.i., and peak levels observed at approximately 8 h p.i. (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, MHV-infected BMM produced IFN much more slowly with levels of IFN-␤ mRNA or IFN protein barely detectable at 8 h p.i. Peak levels of IFN-␤ mRNA and protein were reached at 16 to 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1A to C). Maximal IFN protein levels were approximately 20-to 25-fold lower in MHVinfected cells than in SenV-infected cells ( Fig. 1A and B) . Although the IFN protein levels were much lower in MHV-infected BMM than in SenV-infected cells, IFN-␤ mRNA levels were higher in MHVinfected cells (Fig. 1A to C; see also Fig. 3C and E). This likely resulted from MHV-mediated inhibition of host cell translation, observed in MHV-infected fibroblasts (11, 14, 34, 35) . Consistent with previous findings (23, 32, 33) , we detected less than 3 U/ml of IFN in MHVinfected DC at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1B) . These results did not reflect differences in the ability of the two cell types to produce IFN, because DC rapidly produced IFN after SenV infection and peak IFN protein lev- (52) . Two or three replicates were performed in each experiment, and one of three independent experiments is shown. els were only 2-fold less in SenV-infected BMDC than in BMM (Fig. 1A) . Of note, both BMM and BMDC were readily infected by MHV, although virus replication proceeded more rapidly in BMM, with syncytium formation detected as early as 6 h p.i. and peak viral titers observed at 8 to 12 h p.i. MHV reached maximal virus titers in BMDC that were approximately 1 log unit higher than in BMM (Fig. 1D) .
MHV-induced upregulation of type I IFN, MDA5, and RIG-I in BMM is dependent on IFNAR. To begin to investigate why BMM but not BMDC produced IFN after MHV infection, we examined the levels of MDA5, since this intracellular helical sensor is required for IFN induction in BMM (24) . Basal levels of MDA5 mRNA in mock-infected BMM were approximately 2-fold higher than in BMDC ( Fig. 2A ). After infection with MHV, MDA5 levels were upregulated with similar kinetics in BMM and BMDC; however, levels in BMM were about 20 to 30 times higher than in BMDC at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 2B and C) . Similar changes in expression of a second intracellular sensor molecule, RIG-I, were also observed. RIG-I is not believed to be critical for IFN production in MHV-infected BMM, although it has an important role in cells such as oligodendrocytes (25) .
Type I IFN mediates enhanced expression of MDA5 and RIG-I (36). Thus, elevated baseline levels of MDA5 and RIG-I in MHVinfected BMM ( Fig. 2A ) might facilitate enhanced IFN production at early times p.i., which could then result in increased MDA5 and RIG-I expression after signaling through IFNAR. To examine this possibility, we cultured BMM from wild-type and IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice. We included BMM from MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ mice in these experi-ments, since MyD88 is involved in signaling through TLRs but not IFNAR. We detected low basal levels of IFN, MDA5, and RIG-I in BMM from all mice, although the levels were lowest in IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ BMM (Fig. 3B ). The levels of IFN-␤, MDA5, and RIG-I mRNA were significantly lower in infected IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ BMM than in wildtype BMM (Fig. 3C) . However, the mRNA levels of these molecules in infected IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ BMM were still higher than in mockinfected IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ cells ( Fig. 3B and C), indicating that virus infection directly upregulates IFN-␤, MDA5, and RIG-I, but optimal induction requires signaling through the IFNAR. These differences did not result from differences in susceptibility to infection because equivalent titers of virus were observed in IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ , MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ , and wild-type (WT) BMM at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 3A) . Of note, MHV titers are much higher in tissues of IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice than in wild-type mice. The lack of difference in titers in Fig. 3A may reflect the high multiplicity of infection that we used in our experiments or the well-described relative insensitivity of MHV to IFN signaling in tissue culture cells (13, 14, 37) .
MHV induces IFN production in pDC through a TLR7dependent pathway, which signals through MyD88. TLR7 is also expressed in BMM (38) . However, we found that type I IFN production in MHV-infected BMM was not dependent on MyD88 in agreement with a previous report (24) (Fig. 3C) . Further, the levels of MDA5 and RIG-I in MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ BMM were approximately equal to those found in WT cells, indicating that regulation of in BMDC (C) at different times p.i. were measured by real-time qPCR. C T ratios to HPRT were calculated as described in Materials and Methods. MDA5 and RIG-I were upregulated to a greater extent in BMM than in BMDC (note the differences in scale). Two or three replicates were performed in each experiment, and one of three independent experiments is shown. (B) mRNA was harvested from mock-infected BMM, and basal levels of IFN-␤, MDA5, and RIG-I were measured by real-time qPCR. (C to E) mRNA was harvested 16 h after infection or transfection. mRNA levels were measured by real-time qPCR. C T ratios to HPRT are shown. MHV induced upregulation to a greater extent than poly(I · C) or SenV did (note the differences in scale in panels B to E). Two or three replicates were performed in each experiment, and one of three independent experiments is shown. Values for IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ or MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ BMM that were statistically significantly different from the values for wild-type cells are indicated as follows: *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01. these genes in MHV-infected BMM is not dependent on MyD88 (Fig. 3C ). These findings are not unique for MHV, since expression of IFNAR, but not MyD88, was also required for expression of IFN-␤, MDA5, and RIG-I in BMM that were either transfected with poly(I · C) (Fig. 3D ) or infected with SenV ( Fig. 3E ).
MHV infection results in upregulation of IFN-dependent and -independent cytokines and chemokines to a greater extent in BMM than in BMDC. MHV infection induces expression of an array of cytokines and chemokines in the infected murine central nervous system (CNS), including CXCL10, CCL2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2), TNF, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12, which play important roles in the anti-MHV immune response (39, 40) . We next examined whether BMM produced these cytokines and chemokines after MHV infection and, if so, whether their expression depended upon type I IFN production. We found that these genes were upregulated with similar kinetics in BMM and BMDC; however, BMM expressed much higher levels than BMDC did (Fig. 4A ) (data for IL-6 and IL-10 are not shown). These results were confirmed for TNF, CXCL10, and IL-12 p70 at the protein level by performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 4C and D) . No IL-12 p70 mRNA or protein was detected in BMDC. Of note, basal mRNA levels of CXCL10 and TNF were higher in BMM than in BMDC, while the reverse was true for CCL2 (Fig. 4B) . Nevertheless, all three were expressed at higher levels in BMM during the peak time of infection (Fig. 4A) , indicating that the differences in basal levels did not explain the ability of BMM to produce larger amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to MHV infection.
To assess whether the upregulation of these cytokines and chemokines was IFN dependent, we analyzed only BMM, since BMDC produced very low levels of these molecules and did not express type I IFN. We also included an additional IFNresponsive gene ISG15 (IFN-stimulated gene 15) in these assays. Consistent with a previous study of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BMM and BMDC (41), we found that CXCL10, IL-10, and ISG15 expression was dependent on IFNAR, but not MyD88, signaling (Fig. 5) . TNF, IL-6, and IL-12 p40 mRNA upregulation was abolished in MHV-infected MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ cells and was variably dependent upon IFNAR signaling: the levels of IL-6 and IL-12 p40 were decreased by about 50 to 80% in IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ BMM ( Fig. 5A and B) . These mRNA data were confirmed by measuring the levels of CXCL10, TNF, and IL-12 p70 protein in an ELISA (Fig. 5C ). As in MHV-infected cells, CXCL10 expression in SenV-infected or poly(I · C)-transfected BMM was also dependent on IFNAR, but not MyD88. However, TNF expression in these samples was not dependent on MyD88, consistent with a previous report showing that TNF expression was mediated by direct MDA5 recognition in SenV-infected cells (Fig. 5A) (42) . IL-6 and IL-12 p40 were expressed at very low levels in poly(I · C)-treated or SenV-infected BMM, so expression of these cytokines was not analyzed further.
Exogenous IFN enhances expression of cytokines and other IFN-dependent molecules in MHV-infected BMM at early but not late times p.i. Our results suggested that BMM expression of several inflammation-related molecules, including IFN-␣/␤, MDA5, RIG-I, and CXCL10, required signaling through the IFNAR. However, from these results, it could not be determined whether upregulated expression of these molecules occurred solely as a consequence of MHV-induced IFN induction or if some aspect of virus replication synergistically enhanced expression. Further, the amount of IFN produced in MHV-infected BMM was much lower than in SenV-infected cells, raising questions as to whether this amount was sufficient to fully upregulate these IFN-induced genes. To address these questions, we treated mock-infected or MHV-infected BMM with IFN-␤ and then measured mRNA levels of inflammatory molecules by real-time qPCR. The cells were treated with IFN-␤ at 4 h p.i. to minimize any effect that IFN treatment might have on virus replication; we could not detect any MHV-induced IFN-␤ RNA or IFN protein at this time p.i. (Fig. 1C) . We used a high dose of IFN (800 U of murine IFN-␤) so that any IFN-mediated effects would be readily apparent. For comparison, we also treated mock-and MHVinfected BMDC and 17Cl-1 cells with IFN, since IFN was barely detected at any time p.i. in these cells. IFN treatment did not reduce virus titers in any of these cells, when measured at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 6A) , consistent with previous reports (13, 32, 33) .
To determine whether cytokine production by BMM required virus replication, we exposed BMM to UV-inactivated MHV prior to treatment with IFN-␤. IFN-␤ treatment did not stimulate expression (Fig. 6B) . Treatment with IFN-␤ enhanced IFN production in MHV-infected BMM at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 6B) , which suggests that the levels of MHV-induced IFN were insufficient to maximally increase IFN-␣/␤ expression at this time p.i. However, by 16 h p.i., MHV induced sufficient amounts of IFN so that exogenous IFN had no additional effects (Fig. 6B) . No IFN protein was detected in either MHV-infected BMDC or 17Cl-1 cells (32, 43) , but low levels of IFN mRNA were detected at late times p.i. in these cells (23) . Treatment of MHV-infected BMDC with IFN induced significantly (P Ͻ 0.01) higher levels of IFN-␣/␤ mRNA than did IFN-␤ treatment or MHV infection alone, when measured at 16 h p.i., although the levels were only about 2% of those observed in infected BMM. In 17Cl-1 cells, IFN-␣/␤ was expressed at very low levels after infection, even after IFN-␤ treatment (Fig. 6B) . Combined with data generated from IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ BMM, these results suggest that virus replication is required to initiate production of type I IFN, which functions by autocrine signaling to reach maximal levels.
IFN-␤ treatment upregulated expression of IFNAR-dependent molecules MDA5, RIG-I, CXCL10, and ISG15 in mock-infected BMM and BMDC to maximal levels as early as 4 h posttreatment, and the level remained constant over the next 8 hours (Fig. 6C and  D) . In contrast, expression of these molecules was minimal in MHV-infected BMM at 8 h p.i. but increased over the following 12 to 16 h p.i. (Fig. 2B and C, 4A, and 6C and D) . Exogenous IFN-␤ treatment enhanced expression of these molecules compared to MHV infection alone at 8 but not 16 h p.i., again suggesting that the amount of IFN produced by infected BMM was sufficient for maximal expression at later times p.i. (Fig. 6C and D) . We detected much higher mRNA levels of MDA5 and RIG-I in MHVinfected BMM at 16 h p.i. than in IFN-␤-treated mock-infected cells, although the IFN level induced by MHV was actually lower than 800 U (Fig. 1A and B) . This likely occurred because MDA5 and RIG-I recognize viral PAMPs and directly upregulate expression of these IFN-dependent molecules via a positive-feedback loop. Additionally, these results also suggest that the effects of IFN on neighboring uninfected cells do not account for the elevated levels of IFN, MDA5, and RIG-I detected in these cultures after MHV infection, since the levels were substantially greater than those observed after IFN treatment of mock-infected cells.
In contrast, mRNA expression of MDA5, RIG-I, CXCL10, and ISG15 was lower at 16 h p.i. in BMDC than after IFN treatment alone ( Fig. 6C and D) . No IFN protein was produced at any time after MHV infection in BMDC or 17Cl-1 cells, so exogenous IFN greatly enhanced expression of these genes in both cell types. The lower levels observed in infected BMDC resulted only in part from an inability to produce IFN because even when we treated these cells with IFN-␤, cytokine expression was still much lower than detected in MHV-infected BMM (Fig. 6C and D) . Furthermore, virus replication and IFN acted synergistically only in enhancing CXCL10 expression, with maximal levels obtained when MHVinfected BMDC or 17Cl-1 cells were treated with IFN. Consistent with analyses of IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ cells (Fig. 5A) , TNF expression was not upregulated by IFN treatment in any cell type in the presence or absence of MHV infection (Fig. 6E) .
Finally, we measured CXCL10 protein levels by an ELISA and, as expected, observed increased production of CXCL10 in infected cells. However, CXCL10 protein levels in MHV-infected BMM were comparable to those in IFN-treated mock-infected cells, even though mRNA amounts in MHV-infected cells were appreciably higher at 16 h p.i. (compare Fig. 6D with Fig. 7A ). IFN treatment of MHVinfected BMM, BMDC, and 17Cl-1 cells did not increase CXCL10 protein production compared to IFN treatment alone. These results likely reflect MHV-induced inhibition of host cell protein synthesis, mediated in part by nsp1 (11, 14, 34, 35) . Of note, expression of the MyD88-dependent molecule TNF was not upregulated by IFN treatment in mock-infected or MHV-infected cells (Fig. 7B) , consistent with the real-time qPCR data shown in Fig. 6E .
The ability of coronaviruses to induce an interferon response in some cells and not others is not well understood. BMM and BMDC are derived from the same BM progenitor cells in the presence of different cytokines, but they show substantial differences in type I IFN production and in cytokine and chemokine profiles (41, 44) . Here, we show that maximal IFN production in murine coronavirusinfected BMM requires signaling through the IFNAR (Fig. 3C) . We could detect small amounts of IFN mRNA but not protein in MHVinfected BMM at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 1) . However, IFN may have been produced at low levels at this early time p.i. but immediately depleted by binding to the IFNAR. In support of this, in a prior study, basal expression of IFN by BMM was detected when IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ but not WT BMM were examined by an ELISA (41) . Together, these results suggest that a very small amount of IFN produced initially following infection effected a large increase in the levels of IFN and other inflammatory molecules via autocrine signaling. However, treatment of uninfected BMM with exogenous IFN did not induce the same level of expression of some of these molecules as occurred in MHVinfected cells at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 6) . Thus, active virus replication induced cytokine and chemokine expression via additional pathways in BMM. Furthermore, these molecules were largely produced by infected cells and not neighboring uninfected cells.
It is likely that MDA5 is involved in one or both steps of this amplification process, because MDA5 is expressed in mock-infected BMM (Fig. 2) , and previous work has shown that IFN expression was significantly decreased in MHVinfected MDA5 Ϫ/Ϫ BMM (24) . The levels of MDA5 and RIG-I increased greatly after infection via an IFN-dependent pathway, providing additional pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) for detecting virus replication products. By late times To determine whether upregulation required active virus replication, BMM were exposed to UV-inactivated virus prior to IFN treatment, and the levels of select genes were determined (shown in the boxes to the right of the graph for BMM 16-h sample graphs). C T ratios to HPRT are shown. All genes were induced to higher levels in BMM than in BMDC or 17Cl-1 cells (note the differences in scale). Three or four replicates were performed in each experiment, and one of three independent experiments is shown. Values that were statistically significantly different from the values for cells infected with MHV and treated with IFN are indicated as follows: *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01. p.i., sufficient levels of IFN were synthesized so that exogenously added IFN had no effect on the levels of any molecules that were examined. Similar effects were observed in BMDC and 17Cl-1 fibroblasts, but in these cells, no or very small amounts of IFN mRNA (Fig. 6B ) and no protein (18, 23, 32, 33) were produced endogenously. Consequently, in both cell types, exogenous IFN treatment significantly upregulated expression of MDA5, RIG-I, CXCL10, and ISG15. These results are consistent with recent reports showing that IFN priming prior to tissue culture cell infection with SARS-CoV resulted in augmented expression of several molecules involved in IFN induction and signaling pathways, including CXCL10, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF-7, IFN-␤, ISG15, and 2=,5=oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) (45) . Analogous results were obtained when human conventional DC were primed with IFN prior to infection with influenza A virus (IAV) (46) . Collectively, our results suggest that IFN is critical for maximal expression of these proinflammatory mediators, but unlike MHV-infected BMDC or 17Cl-1 cells, sufficient amounts of IFN are expressed endogenously via an MDA5-dependent pathway in infected BMM to initiate the process.
The enhanced responsiveness of BMM compared to BMDC or fibroblasts to MHV infection also occurs after exposure to other stimuli. The levels of IFN-dependent proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, were higher in BMM than in BMDC after stimulation with LPS (44) . This increased sensitivity to MHV infection is not likely to be a function of differences in basal levels because baseline levels of MDA5 and RIG-I are only 2-fold higher in BMM than in BMDC ( Fig. 2A) ; both cell types should have responded nearly equivalently to infection, if basal levels of MDA5 were the only factor. On the other hand, MDA5 levels are extremely low in 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 6C ) (24) , and this may have contributed to the inability of these cells to produce IFN and other IFN-dependent proteins. Another possible explanation for the difference in IFN expression in infected BMM compared to BMDC or fibroblasts is that virus replication could occur on different types of membranous structures in the different cell types. MHV is known to replicate on double-membrane vesicles (DMV) and other intracellular membranes (20) . DMV may shield viral dsRNA from detection by MDA5 and RIG-I, so differences in the numbers of DMV or in the types of membranous structures used in replication could potentially contribute to differences in PAMP recognition and subsequent IFN induction. However, we detected no obvious differences in the types of virus-specific membranous structures observed in BMM compared to other cells when analyzed by electron microscopy (data not shown); if anything, the numbers of DMV in infected BMM were increased more than in other cells, probably reflecting the more rapid course of infection observed in these cells (Fig. 1D) . Thus, an outstanding question is how the milieu of resting macrophages differs from those of BMDC and fibroblasts, enabling rapid and extensive upregulation of IFN-␣/␤ and other proinflammatory molecules after infection with coronaviruses.
While a type I IFN amplification loop is critical for maximal production of IFN and other molecules such as CXCL10, some aspects of the innate response in MHV-infected BMM are not IFN dependent. Thus, expression of TNF, IL-12, and IL-6 ( Fig. 5) is completely dependent upon signaling through MyD88. MyD88 is a key adaptor molecule in signaling pathways used by IL-1, IL-18, and all of the TLRs except TLR3. We examined the expression of TLR2, -3, -4, -6, and -7 and found that they were expressed at low levels in uninfected BMM and upregulated after MHV infection (data not shown). Therefore, signaling through one of these molecules could initiate the expression of these MyD88-dependent cytokines. In fact, IL-6 and TNF production in peritoneal macrophages infected with the hepatotropic MHV-3 strain is TLR2 dependent (47) . However, in preliminary experiments, we detected the same levels of TNF and IL-6 in MHV-A59-infected B6 and TLR2 Ϫ/Ϫ BMM, suggesting that TLR2 does not have the same critical role in BMM as observed in MHV-3infected peritoneal macrophages. Consistent with this putative cellspecific difference in expression, splenic macrophages but not BMM produce TNF in response to TLR2 ligands (48) .
The relative importance of IFN production by macrophages compared to pDC is not known in MHV-infected mice. Cervantes-Barragan et al. showed that pDC depletion diminished IFN-␣ production by approximately 10-fold in mice with MHVinduced hepatitis (23) . Type I IFN-mediated protection of MHVinfected mice occurred via effects on macrophages and conventional dendritic cells (cDC) because deletion of IFNAR from macrophages and cDC but not nonhematopoietic or other hematopoietic cells resulted in severe liver disease (49) . Thus, it is possible that IFN produced by infected macrophages at sites of infection is critical in protecting neighboring macrophages and DC from infection and in priming all cells in the CNS and other sites of infection for subsequent IFN and cytokine production.
Taken together, our results show that macrophages, long considered a major target for infection with MHV, use both IFNARdependent and -independent pathways to enhance the inflammatory milieu at sites of infection and that these pathways are preferentially activated in these cells compared to DC or fibroblasts. Combined with previous studies (50), they suggest that macrophages are an attractive target for modulating the immune response to enhance virus clearance while minimizing immunopathological disease.
Viruses and cell cultures. MHV-A59 (MHV) was grown on 17Cl-1 cells, and the titers of the virus on HeLa cells expressing CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1), the MHV receptor (51), were determined as previously described (52) . The cells were infected with MHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 or, as a control, with 100 hemagglutination activity units of Sendai virus (SenV) (Cantell strain; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). 17Cl-1 cells were cultured in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FBS), 5% tryptose phosphate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
In some experiments, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were transfected with 20 g/ml poly(I · C) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In some experiments, mock-infected or MHV-infected BMM, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC), or 17Cl-1 cells were treated with 800 U of murine IFN-␤ (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, Piscataway, NJ) at 4 h p.i., and either cells (mRNA) or supernatants (protein) were harvested at 8 h or 16 h p.i.
Mice. Pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). Mice deficient in IFN-␣/␤ receptor expression (IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ ) or in MyD88 expression (MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ ) were kindly provided by John Harty (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) or by Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and Madhu Singh (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), respectively.
Generation of BMM and BMDC. Primary bone marrow cells were isolated from the hind limbs of WT, IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ , or MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ C57BL/6 mice as previously described (32) . BMM were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% L929 cell-conditioned medium (as a source for macrophage colony-stimulating factor [M-CSF]), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were harvested 7 days after plating and were Ͼ90% pure (CD11b ϩ CD11c -), as determined by flow cytometry. BMDC were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1.0 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.02 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1,000 U/ml recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and 25 U/ml recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). The cells were used after 7 days of culture and were Ͼ80% pure (CD11b ϩ CD11c ϩ ) as determined by flow cytometry.
Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. RNA was isolated from BMM, BMDC, or 17Cl-1 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). The levels of mRNA of genes of interest were determined by real-time qPCR as previously described (43) . Primers are listed in Table 1 . Cycle threshold (C T ) values were normalized to the values for the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) by the following equation: C T ϭ C T (gene of interest) Ϫ C T (HPRT) . All results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as Ϫ2 C T . IFN bioassay. The levels of IFN were measured using a bioassay based on the inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) growth in L929 cells. Supernatants were harvested from infected BMM or BMDC, and infectious virus was inactivated by exposure to UV light. L929 cells infected with 10,000 PFU VSV were treated with dilutions of supernatants or defined amounts of recombinant murine IFN-␤ at 30 min p.i. The titers of VSV were determined on Vero cells. IFN levels were calculated on the basis of standard curves generated with recombinant IFN-␤.
ELISA. To measure the protein levels of cytokines of interest, supernatants were harvested from mock-infected or MHV-infected BMM or BMDC and analyzed for CXCL10 (PBL Biomedical Laboratory) or IL-12 p70 or TNF (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) by an ELISA per the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistics. A Student's t test was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. All results are expressed as means Ϯ standard errors of the means (SEM).

150,2060cb027399ce2ff97b6f9d17b932aa16dd0844,"Purpose: Several markers for eosinophilic inflammation have been proposed to predict response to asthma treatment. However, definitive criteria for treatment decisions have not yet been established. We investigate a potentially useful relatively non-invasive biomarker, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), to predict favorable responses to budesonide or montelukast, common treatment for children with asthma. Methods: Young children (1 to 6 years old) were enrolled in this randomized, parallel, 2-group, open-label trial. Criteria for eligibility included: 1) being symptomatic during the run-in period; and 2) having a serum EDN (sEDN) level ≥ 53 ng/mL, with positive specific immunoglobulin E to house dust mite. Eligible patients were randomly placed into 2 groups: the BIS group received budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) 0.5 mg once daily; the MONT group received montelukast 4 mg once daily. Ineligible patients were invited to receive montelukast 4 mg once daily (OBS group). Treatment period was 12 weeks. Results: Asthma control days increased significantly in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000) over the 12-week study period. There was no significant change in sEDN in the BIS group but there was a significant decrease in the MONT group (P < 0.000). Patients in the OBS group with high EDN levels (> 53 ng/mL) showed a significant decrease due to MONT treatment (P = 0.023). Rescue medication usage significantly decreased in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000). Conclusions: EDN is a useful relatively non-invasive biomarker for predicting responses to montelukast and budesonide treatment of preschool children with beta2-agonist responsive recurrent wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze (Trial registry at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000008335).","Chronic airway inflammation is a hallmark of asthma 1 ; consequently, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the main treatment. 2 Although leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) also have anti-inflammatory properties 3 and are often administered, especially to young children, guidelines clearly state ICSs are the preferred option for long-term control of asthma. 2 This preference is based mainly on evidence from clinical trials comparing mean responses between treatment and control groups. However, other trials have demonstrated that there is considerable inter-individual variability in treatment response to ICSs versus LTRAs. [4] [5] [6] It is important for a clinician to collect information that better guides them in selecting medication most likely to achieve a favorable response in each patient (i.e., tailor-made treatment regimens).
Several markers for eosinophilic inflammation or atopy, such as elevated levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) due to house dust mite (HDM), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp), sensitivity, 7 sputum eosinophil counts, 8 exhaled nitric oxide 9 and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), 10 have been suggested to predict response to ICSs. However, definitive criteria for treatment decisions are still to be established. In addition, characteristics of airway pathology in preschool children may be different from those in older children and adults, 11 which may lead to differential treatment responses.
In addition to ECP, elevated levels of another eosinophil degranulation product, eosinophilderived neurotoxin (EDN), have been noted in asthmatics, with higher levels also found during asthma exacerbation when compared to healthy patients and those with stable asthma. 12 Therefore, EDN has been suggested as a key marker for disease activity of asthma and other eosinophil-related disease. 13 To date, there are no published studies comparing differential responses to the 2 types of anti-inflammatory therapies, namely ICSs and LTRAs, for preschool children with asthma. Furthermore, clinical markers for these possible differential responses have not been defined.
Here, we propose a study to seek a useful and relatively non-invasive marker (i.e., serum EDN [sEDN] ) to predict favorable responses to nebulized budesonide or montelukast, common treatment options for young children with asthma.
Children aged 1 to 6 years were enrolled in this study. Because asthma is a heterogeneous disease and especially difficult to diagnose in this age group, the definition of asthma used was based on the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2 and Japanese pediatric guidelines. 14 Major inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) 3 or more recurrent wheezing episodes within a year, with at least one confirmed by a physician, and multiple-trigger wheeze (not just common cold but other triggers such as exercise, crying or laughing); and 2) improvement of wheezing after administration of inhaled or oral short-acting beta2-agonists. Minor inclusion criteria include at least one of the following: 1) parental asthma, 2) physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis (AD), 3) physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis (AR) or 4) physiciandiagnosed food allergy. To be included in the study, a patient must have had both major criteria and at least one of the minor inclusion criteria. Criteria for randomization included patient was: 1) symptomatic during the run-in period; and 2) had a sEDN level ≥ 53 ng/ mL, 13 with positive specific IgE to HDM (Immulite 2000 3gAllergy > 0.1 IU A /mL). 14 Exclusion criteria included one or more of the following: 1) patients who received asthma controller medication, such as ICSs or LTRAs, in the previous 6 months; 2) chronic lung disease, heart or kidney disease or any other congenital disease; and 3) a patient whom the physician regarded as inappropriate for the study (e.g., did not attend the clinic when instructed).
This was a randomized, parallel, 3-group, open-label trial. Patients who met the enrollment criteria entered a 2-week run-in period, with short-acting beta2-agonists as needed. Participants were then randomly selected to join 1 of the 2 groups: the BIS group received budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) 0.5 mg once daily for 12 weeks and the MONT group received montelukast 4 mg once daily (orally) for 12 weeks. BIS was administered via a SkyNeb (Medel, Milan, Italy) compressor and nebulizer with a mouthpiece (for older children) or face mask (for children 1-3 years old). Patients that were ineligible for the trial because randomization criteria 2) was not met, EDN < 53 ng/mL and/or negative specific IgE to HDM, yet had symptoms in the run-in period were invited to receive montelukast 4 mg once daily based on recommendation by the Japanese guideline. 14,15 They were observed for 12 weeks as exploratory purpose (OBS group). Parents/caregivers of all participants were instructed to record all symptoms and treatment times in an asthma diary. Patients were evaluated at 4-week intervals ( Fig. 1) in either a hospital or clinic to have their asthma diary checked and to determine whether a step-up in therapy was needed as per GINA and Japanese guidelines.
Computer randomization of an eligible patient into either the BIS or MONT group was performed. However, adjustments were made so that there was a statistically similar proportion of patients in each group based on age (1-2 years old versus 3-5 years old), sex and specific IgE to HDM (< 10 IUA/mL versus ≥ 10 IUA/mL). 
EDN levels in each patient were measured twice: at −2 weeks (during the run-in period) and at the 12-week time point. EDN was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) following the manufacturer's protocol (MBL, Woburn, MA, USA), and the results were expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). This ELISA detects human EDN with a minimum detection limit of < 0.62 ng/mL, a maximum detection limit > 300 ng/mL, and no cross-reaction with ECP. All assays were run in duplicate, and the mean value was used for statistical analyses.
At initial enrollment and when exhibiting asthma or upper respiratory infection symptoms at regular visits, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and total RNA from common respiratory viruses was extracted and identified using a multiplex PCR system (Seeplex RV12 Ace Detection; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) that identifies adenovirus ( 
Primary outcome was the number of asthma control days (ACD). An ACD was defined as a day with no beta-agonist rescue use; use of oral corticosteroids for asthma; daytime symptoms; nighttime awakenings; unscheduled health care visits, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations for asthma; or school absenteeism for asthma. ACD in both groups (BIS and MONT) were compared in 2 ways: 1) within group analyses comparing ACD at the beginning of the treatment period (0 week) to ACD at the other 3-time points (4, 8 and 12 weeks); and 2) between group analyses comparing ACD in each group at each time point (e.g., BIS ACD at 0 week versus MONT ACD at 0 week). An ACD value was calculated for each group during each time period. For example, ACD at 0 week was calculated during the 2-week run-in period (i.e., −2 to 0 week), ACD at 4 weeks was calculated during the time period from 0 to 4 weeks, etc. The first comparison used 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Sidak's multiple comparisons test. The second comparison used the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test.
A secondary outcome of this study was to compare changes in sEDN in all patients with sEDN ≥ 53 ng/mL and HDM sensitivity (BIS and MONT groups) and in those patients whose sEDN was < 53 ng/mL, were not sensitive to HDM or both (OBS group). Serum was taken from each patient at −2 weeks, sEDN was measured, and then this value was used at 0 week (termed ""Pre"") to randomize each patient into either the BIS or the MONT group. Also, sEDN was measured at 12 weeks (termed ""Post""). ""Pre"" and ""Post"" sEDN levels were then compared in each patient using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test.
Another secondary outcome of this study was changes in rescue medication usage with treatment. Comparisons were done in 3 ways: 1) within each group (BIS and MONT), usage at run-in (−2 weeks) was compared to usage at the end of the treatment period (12 weeks); 2) each subject in each group was analyzed over the study period (−2 to 12 weeks) to determine any change in usage; 3) usage in BIS group was compared to usage in MONT group at each time point (−2, 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks). For each endpoint, stratified analysis was performed based on the virus type detected.
Within group analyses of ACD at multiple time points during the entire study period (−2 to 12 weeks) were compared using 2-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak's multiple comparisons test. This was only done for the BIS and MONT groups. Between-group analyses of ACD (BIS versus MONT groups) were done using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Within group analyses of treatment effect comparing ""Pre"" (measured during run-in period −2 to 0 week) and ""Post"" (measured at 12 weeks) measurements of changes in sEDN for all 3 groups (BIS, MONT and OBS) were done using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Each group was then subgrouped according to presence or absence of any virus and change in sEDN with treatment from ""Pre"" to ""Post"" was analyzed using the same statistical test. Rescue medication usage within each group (BIS and MONT) and between each group were also compared. Data that were normally distributed were presented as mean values, unless otherwise noted. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Fig. 2 . 
ANOVA followed by the Bonn Ferroni multiple comparison test were used to determine any statistical differences in demographic data among the 3 groups (i.e., BIS, MONT, and OBS; Table 1 ). Age (P < 0.05) and the proportion of those with AD (P < 0.05) in the OBS group were significantly lower compared to the other groups. The age difference between the OBS groups and the other 2 groups was expected as subjects in the BIS and MONT groups were age-matched. All other demographic variables were statistically similar among the 3 groups.
Laboratory data at entry can be found in Table 2 . HDM-IgE and send levels in the OBS group were significantly lower when compared to the other 2 groups. This was expected because to be included in the OBS group a patient had to have a sEDN level < 53 ng/mL, no sensitivity to HDM or both. ACD ACD increased significantly in each group (P < 0.000) from the beginning of the study (0 week) to the end of the study (12 weeks). However, when comparing ACD of each group at each time point, there were no significant differences (Fig. 3) BIS, budesonide inhalation suspension; MONT, eligible and receiving montelukast; OBS, not eligible and receiving montelukast. *Age in OBS group significantly lower (P < 0.05); † % Atopic dermatitis significantly less (P < 0.05). 
There was no significant change in sEDN in the BIS group (Fig. 4A) , but there was a significant decrease found in the MONT group (P < 0.000) (Fig. 4B) . When the OBS group was divided into those with low EDN (< 53 ng/mL) (Fig. 4C) and those with high EDN (> 53 ng/mL) (Fig. 4D) , only patients with high EDN exhibited a significant decrease due to MONT treatment (P = 0.023), regardless of HDM sensitization.
Forty-four (46.8%) study subjects were positive for any virus tested ( Table 2) . When each treatment group (BIS, MONT was subgrouped according to virus-positivity, measured for sEDN ""Pre"" and ""Post""), then changes in sEDN (ΔEDN) were compared between viruspositive and -negative subjects in the BIS and MONT groups, and ΔEDN was significantly larger in the virus-negative MONT subgroup (Supplementary Fig. S1B ) and mean ΔEDN was also larger in the virus-nagative BIS subgroup, but not statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. S1B) . Changes in ACD were not different between virus-positive and -negative subgroups in the BIS (Supplementary Fig. S2A ) and MONT (Supplementary Fig. S2B ) groups.
Another secondary outcome of this study was change in rescue medication usage with treatment. Comparisons were done 3 ways: 1) within each group (BIS and MONT), usage at run-in (−2 weeks) was compared to usage at the end of the treatment period (12 weeks); 2) each subject in each group was analyzed over the study period (−2 weeks to 12 weeks) to determine any change in usage; 3) usage in the BIS group was compared to usage in the MONT group at each time point (−2, 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks). There was a significant decrease (P < 0.000) in rescue medication usage within each group (BIS and MONT) and in each subject in each group when analyzed over the study period (−2 to 12 weeks) (P = 0.002). However, there were no significant differences found when comparing usage in the BIS group to that in the MONT group 
This study clearly demonstrated that preschool children with beta2-agonist responsive recurrent wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze, a high EDN level, and HDM sensitivity responded well to both montelukast and budesonide. As expected, montelukast treatment significantly reduced sEDN levels. Unexpectedly, BIS treatment did not. Both treatments also resulted in significant decreases in rescue medication usage over the treatment period. In terms of clinical outcomes, montelukast was as effective as budesonide in the biomarkerdefined (i.e., mite sensitized, eosinophilic asthma) subpopulation of preschool asthmatics.
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes. The recognition of a high EDN/ HDM-sensitive phenotype that exhibits a favorable response to standard asthma treatments is important. Of the 100 patients screened for eligibility, nearly half (43%) were found to be of this phenotype, which is considerable. The elevated levels of EDN and other eosinophil degranulation products found in symptomatic asthma would suggest airway inflammation is characterized not only by an increase in the number of eosinophils, but also an increase in airway eosinophil degranulation. 16 Therefore, it has been suggested that the secretory activity of eosinophils -a combination of concentration of eosinophils and their propensity to release degranulation products -may be a key marker for disease activity and is more accurately assessed by eosinophil degranulation products such as EDN. 17 EDN is released almost exclusively by eosinophils 18 ; therefore, any change in EDN levels would be a direct reflection of changes in eosinophilic inflammation. Significant changes in EDN levels between disease phases have been noted in previous studies. 12, 19 EDN may therefore be useful in predicting therapeutic outcomes and is a welcome addition to a clinician's ability to effectively treat and monitor asthma. This was further demonstrated in our study as montelukast treatment significantly reduced elevated EDN levels in the MONT group, which has also been shown in other asthma studies 12 and even in patients with post-RSV bronchiolitis recurrent wheeze. 20 Among the subjects excluded from the main study group (OBS group), the subgroup with no HDM sensitivity but elevated EDN experienced a reduction in their EDN levels as well.
Montelukast was the chosen treatment for the OBS group because it has been reported that ICS is less effective in non-atopic populations. 21 Furthermore, from our clinical experience montelukast is preferred over ICS by both physicians and patients in Korea and Japan.
Treatment-related reduction in EDN levels may yield actual patient benefits. In our study, subjects receiving montelukast treatment over 12 weeks had not only a significant increase in the number of ACD compared to the beginning of the study, but also had a statistically similar number of ACD at each time point (4, 8 and 12 weeks) when compared to those receiving BIS treatment (BIS group). This is an interesting finding considering a recent Cochrane Review of 65 studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy of anti-leukotrienes and ICSs as monotherapy found ICS treatment to be superior in a number of respects including symptom-free days. 22 However, it should be noted that no sample size calculation was done for our study. This point will be discussed further in the study limitations section. The BIS group also showed a significant increase in ACD over the 12-week treatment period.
In previous asthma 12 and AD 23 studies, sEDN levels have correlated well with symptom scores. It is known that eosinophils release EDN and other degranulation products when activated; in particular, peripheral blood eosinophils were found to release approximately 17%-28% of their total intracellular EDN. 24 Furthermore, Sedgwick et al. 24 demonstrated that intracellular EDN is also increased in asthmatic patients, while ECP is not. Montelukast is an LTRA, capable of binding with cysteine leukotriene (cysLT) receptors expressed on eosinophils and disrupting their autocrine release. CysLTs can induce eosinophil degranulation, 25 which then leads to release of a number of mediators including EDN, ECP and cysLTs. 26 This may explain the reduction in EDN levels in the MONT group and in patients in the OBS group with high EDN levels. Corticosteroid treatment may or may not eliminate cytokine-primed, EDNincreased and longer-surviving eosinophils resulting in decreased EDN levels. 12 We observed no significant decrease in EDN levels after budesonide treatment in our study, which was contrary to our initial hypothesis that budesonide would also reduce EDN levels. This may be because budesonide, an ICS, acts locally, whereas montelukast acts systemically. Eosinophils develop principally in the bone marrow and are recruited from the circulation, where they migrate to inflammatory sites, such as the airways, and then participate in immunologic processes. 26 Once activated, the eosinophil releases EDN and other granular proteins. Changes in granular protein levels signal changes in the turnover and activity of the eosinophil. Taken together, eosinophil production, recruitment and activation are a systemic process.
All patients in this study were also tested for virus infection as it is well known that respiratory viral infection is the major cause of asthma exacerbation in children. 27 We detected virus in about half of the treated subjects and reduction in sEDN levels was significantly larger in the virus-negative subgroup of the MONT group, indicating that virus infection may have hindered the effect of montelukast (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). However, EDN levels still significantly decreased in virus-positive MONT subgroups (data not shown), which may have resulted in the same levels of improvement in ACD in the virus-positive and -negative subgroups (Supplementary Fig. S2 ).
Study limitations included: 1) the open-label design, which could have affected results through the placebo effect; 2) measurements for both secondary outcomes (i.e., sEDN level and rescue medication usage) were done only 2 times, once at the beginning of the study for baseline and a second time at the end of the study, so it may have been more beneficial to measure serially; 3) patient recruitment was through a few different healthcare centers, which may have introduced spectrum bias and affected study results; 4) no sample size calculation was done, so that the number of eligible patients for the study (n = 43) may have been too small to accurately assess the association between predictor (i.e., elevated sEDN and positive IgE for HDM) and outcome (significant improvement in ACD, sEDN and rescue medication following treatment).
Recent meta-analyses 28 of Green et al.'s study 8 and 2 others 29,30 bolster the hypothesis that treatment-based eosinophil indices is more efficacious (i.e., reduces the frequency and severity of exacerbations) than treatment based on clinical symptoms and other traditional objective measures of lung function such as peak expiratory flow and spirometry. Tailoring patient treatment based on the direct and objective measurement of airway inflammation resulted in significantly less frequent and severe asthma exacerbations and, consequently a trend towards fewer asthma-related hospital admissions. 28 Knowing both the inflammatory profile and the clinical categorization of the patient develops a clearer phenotype of the asthma patient and appears to contribute to improved asthma care. 27, 31 Using a more accurate biomarker for eosinophilic inflammation in the management of asthma may produce even better results. 32, 33 It has been suggested by many studies that EDN is a more accurate biomarker than eosinophil numbers or percentages. 11, 12, 22, 32 Future studies of EDN as a biomarker for the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of conditions associated with airway inflammation -such as recurrent wheeze, multiple-trigger wheeze and asthma -are needed.",Montelukast Reduces Serum Levels of Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin in Preschool Asthma,"Kim, Chang-Keun; Callaway, Zak; Park, Jin-Sung; Nishimori, Hisashi; Ogino, Tikatoshi; Nagao, Mizuho; Fujisawa, Takao",Allergy Asthma Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6182197/,262,3320,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Retrospective case series of patients managed by our mobile extracorporeal membrane oxygenation team and transferred to San Gerardo University Hospital from December 2004 to December 2012. Results: 42 patients were transported. The mean age was 42.11 (standard deviation ±18.11) years, with a range between 2 years and 70. 14 patients were females (33%) and 28 males (67%). The average transport distance was 121.69 km (±183.08) with a range between 9 km and 1044 Km. The mission's mean time was equal to 508 minutes (±185) with range of 120-960 minutes. 29 patients (69%) were transported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, while 13 patients (31%) were transported with conventional ventilation. In 28 patients (97%) a veno-venous bypass was utilized, while in one case (3%) a Veno-Arterial cannulation was performed. 32 patients survived (76%) and have been discharged alive from hospital. No major clinical or technical issues were observed during the transport. Conclusions: According to our data, we conclude that a dedicated mobile team allowed safe ground transportation of patients with severe acute lung injury to our tertiary care institution.","The in-and out-of-hospital transport of the critically ill patient is a virtual risk of adverse clinical events also related to a potential equipment's failure (1) (2) (3) . Patient's safety is dependant on the adherence to transport's protocols (4, 5) . Patients af-fected by Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) present with hypoxia and instability of gases exchange, a situation which may require the use of extracorporeal respiratory support (ECMO -Extra Corporeal Membrane oxygenation) as an emergency life-saving therapy or as a protective strategy to prevent further barotraumas from mechanical ventilation (ALI -acute lung injury) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . In many cases, patients with ARDS should be referred to an ECMO centre, but the severe and often rapid onset of hypoxia, not manageable with conventional treatments, Heart, Lung and Vessels. 2014, Vol. 6 may not allow for a safe conventional transport (11) (12) (13) (14) . The General Intensive Care of San Gerardo University Hospital-Monza has been working since 1989 as an Italian ECMO referring centre. Up to 2004, patients from different hospitals eligible for ECMO treatment were transported with conventional ventilation techniques by the same hospital's clinical team, increasing in this way risks related to unsafe transport. In 2004, inspired by similar programs carried out in other countries, we implemented and put in practice a new program of ECMO positioning at the reporting ICU and consequent inter-hospital transport of these patients (8, 11) . The basic team consist of two intensivists, an ICU nurse and a perfusionist. The aim of this paper is to present our 8-year experience on inter-hospital transport of patients with severe acute respiratory failure managed by our mobile transport team (which also has ECMO capability).
From December 2004 to December 2012 we collected data concerning the activity of our Mobile ECMO team. All consecutive patients transferred by our mobile transport team were included in the study. Clinical records (Innovian Medical Suite © -Drager Medical) and manual data sheets were retro- spectively reviewed. Due to the retrospective observational design of the study, informed consent was waived, according to Italian Regulations (AIFA, Directive of March 20, 2008) . Data from the fi rst 14 transports have previously been published (13) . All patient transfers were performed from local trust to San Gerardo Hospital (SGH) and subsequently admitted into our 10-bedded General ICU. The National Health insurance covered the expenses of the transport, and the average cost was 10.000,00€ ± 800,00 per transport (ambulance 720,00 € ±278,00 -staff 2.500,00 € ±780,00 -medical devices: 6.500,00 € ±100,00). The alert protocol and procedure for patient eligible for ECMO treatment was based on phone call to our unit for the fi rst evaluation and commence for possible transport activation ( Figure 1) . Criteria for ECMO team activation were: reversible respiratory failure, PaO 2 value <50 mmHg with FiO 2 ≥60% for more 12 hours, Lung Injury Score ≥3; or respiratory acidosis pH ≤7.2 (13) . Exclusion criteria were: intracranial bleeding/haemorrhage, unable to undergoing to heparinization, negative prognosis,body weight ≥130 Kg (logistic and equipment restrictions). The internal standard procedure, in case of positive assessment for transport, guarantee an ECMO crew activation time within 60 to 90 minutes after the distress call. The basic team includes two intensivists (MD), one Registered Nurse specialist (RN) and one perfusionist. When possible, a professional on training joined the mission for transport education. The transportation program began in 2004 based on experience gained by our ICU staff from in-hospital patient transport on extracorporeal support (14) . Since 1994, in hospital transfers were performed by a mobilization system able to house all the biomedical equipment. This tool underwent continuous evaluation to optimize logistics and performance (15) . This device is composed of an x-ray spine board compatible and multi-storey counter top. The pulmonary ventilator, the ECMO pump, syringe pumps and monitoring are placed on shelves. The counter top is equipped with an electrical junction box that provides power to all equipment by a single connection from the main electricity network. Figure 2 shows the system's structure and Figure 3 Heart, Lung and Vessels. 2014, Vol. 6 Table 1 -Technical data of ambulances used in inter-hospital transports.
Technical data: Table 1 .
The gas circuit has 4 connections: 2 for oxygen and 2 for compressed air (UNI grafts), controlled by an electronic unit with automatic switching from one cylinder to another. A gas monitoring and alarm system is in situ to check the working pressure and the residual gas availability. In case of electric failure it is possible to switch into manual pneumatic dispensing delivery of the gases. In order to reduce risks and guarantee the best comfort during transfer from ground to ambulance floor, the vehicle is equipped with a stretcher supported with hydro pneumatic suspension (model: STEM-Piuma ® ). In addition to oxygen and compressed air, it is possible to deliver nitric oxide via cylinder 10 L volume/200 ATM pressure via a nitric system. An additional vehicle transports the rest of the crew and equipment. All the equipment required to perform the cannulation and transport has been split into three bags. All the materials ( As far as the veno-venous support (twosites approach) is concerned, a drainage percutaneous cannula-multistage type was usually positioned in the left femoral vein and a percutaneous no multistage-cannula type was used for the reinfused blood, to avoid blood recirculation. Two types of centrifugal pump have been used: Rotaflow ® and Cardiohelp ® System. The first choice was the two-site veno-venous approach to allow for quick weaning from sedative drugs and an early mobilization of the patient (9) . All the cannulations were performed via percutaneous approach, using real-time ultrasound and a dilatation modified technique to reduce the enlargement stages (16) . At the time of arrival of the ECMO team, the following procedures were carried out : patient assessment and optimization of the ventilator setting (recruitment manoeuvre, lung protective ventilation with tidal volumes <6ml/Kg, trial of inhaled Nitric
Oxide, apparatus dead space reduction by removal of mount connector or HME (heat and moisture exchange), close suctioning system and continuous EtCO 2 monitoring) (17) (18) (19) , to evaluate the safety and feasibility of patient transport with ""conventional"" ventilation (i.e. without ECMO). Criteria for transport with ""conventional"" ventilation were: pO 2 >90 mmHg with FiO 2 = 1, pCO 2 <65 mmHg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) <20 cmH 2 O. If these criteria were not met or in case for any reason a transport with ""conventional"" ventilation was not judged safe, an ECMO support was started on site and the patients were transferred on ECMO.
After the ECMO support has been established, the minute ventilation is gradually (departure from and back to SGH) was equal to 508 minutes (±185 with range of 120-960 minutes). The longest distance of 1044 km was performed by transportation of the ambulance and team on the 'Hercules C 130' aircraft provided by the Italian Air Force. No mission was postponed or cancelled due to organizational failure or extreme weather conditions. For 28 (67%) transports, transfer pulmonary ventilator EVITA ® (4 or XL -Dräger Medical) were used, while in 13 cases (31%) SERVO I ® Maquet ventilator was the choice; and only for the first transport the Siemens SERVO 300 ® ventilator was used. The median number of syringe pumps used during transport was 4 (IQR 3-4/range 2-6). The median number of inotropic drugs (Dopamine, Dobutamine, Norepinephrine) administered during transport was equal to 1 (IQR 0-1/range 0-1). We did not report any morbidity or mortality due to the transport or to the ECMO support on transfer.
The following complications were observed: in one patient battery failure of Evita XL® ventilator during transport from the ICU to the ambulance; in another case it was difficult to obtain an acceptable extracorporeal flow due to the patient's position and it was necessary to stop the ambulance to reposition the patient. No patient required transfusion of blood products during transport. The average days on ECMO were equal to 18.21 (±22.96 -range 2/116). The average length of stay in ICU was 26.07 days (±27.96 -range 2/126). 33 patients (79%) were discharged alive from SGH, 9 died in the ICU (21%). All patients who died were transported with ECMO support: no patient died during transport, but they all died while still on ECMO. In the group of patients who required ECMO support, a subgroup analysis was performed to investigate differences between survivors and non-survivors with regard to: pre-ECMO ventilation days, days on ECMO and length of hospital stay. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the duration of mechanical ventilation before the activation of the ECMO team: in survivors the median of pre-ECMO ventilation days was 2 (IQR:1-4) while in non-survivors was equal to 8 days (IQR:3-13) (p=0.04). Table 4 collects data of all patients related to pre-transfer, data collected on arrival to SGH and the ones related to patients transferred on ECMO versus no ECMO support.
The early commence of ECMO support provides an extra source of recovery for patients who develop an acute respiratory failure not responding to standard strategy of care; furthermore for long ventilated patients, the ECMO support let to perform respiratory tidal volume less than 6 ml/kg and low respiratory rate. Many patients referred for ECMO treatment cannot take benefits from this advanced support due to high risks of death related to an ordinary transfer based on standard respiratory setting. Implementing the ECMO cannulation standards outside of SGH required several steps. The first transport required two days of preparation to assemble the equipment and suitable staff. The ambulance choice required a strict collaboration between ICU staff, ambulance crew and the SGH medical physics dept., to get through/to rule out all the technical issues related to the vehicle (electricity power supply and medical gas circuit). The nursing staff that carried out the transport was trained on fieldwork by tutoring, which was held after the first transport, according to the literature (20, 21) . In order to be qualified for transport, these are the minimum requirements: two years experience in ICU, 2 in hospital cannulation, 2 in intra-hospital transport experience and two out of hospital missions supervised by a qualified nurse. The nursing staff education (theoretical and practical) was managed by the head nurse and a senior qualified nurse. To sort out the mission different paper-work (flow charts and checklists) were created in order to verify the equipments (22, 23) . Patients included in this report had an average severe hypoxia (pO 2 : 64.96±18.15 mmHg). Despite their respiratory instability, the cardiovascular status of patients was stable. The transport described above requireed a great preparation time compared with traditional techniques. Benefits of this system involve the absence of extra adjustments after this stage, so patient will be ready to be transported straight to ambulance, furthermore after positioning in the back, there is no need to rearrange any equipment (syringe pumps ,circuit, ventilator) because they are already settled, reducing the time of transfer and possible complications according to the literature (13, 14) . All the equipment's packs for transport are dedicated to ECMO transports only (24) . It makes easier to perform the quality checks and battery packs levels. These are relevant facts, identified as the most responsible in the case of adverse events such as battery failure (25, 26) . Finally, it is important to point out our attitude and confidence, as referral centre, in using intensive care ventilators to perform ECMO transport compared with dedicated transport's ventilator (27, 28 (30) ; b) since the number of ventilation days before ECMO institution is clearly related to survival, it is of paramount importance that all patients deemed eligible for ECMO treatment are referred as early as possible to a specialized ICU. These data is similar to those published by all centers related to Italian ""ECMOnet"" (12) .
In addition, it must be underlined the importance of clinical stabilization of the patients before transport (29) . The number of adverse events observed in our patients during transport were comparable to those reported by other centers or networks that have implemented similar programs aimed at the centralization of ECMO candidates (7, 8, 12, 30) .
The main limitation of this study is related to retrospective analysis. Data were collected from medical records and it was not possible to get back all the clinical data for each patient prior to ambulance transfer. For this reason, we could not compare the different subgroups with regard to severity scores (like SOFA or APACHE) or to the incidence of other comorbidities. However, our goal was only to report our 8-years experience of inter-hospital transportation of critically ill patients and to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of a ""Mobile ECMO team"" program. We are now performing a prospective study with capillary recording of all relevant clinical variables, in order to perform adequate comparison between different groups of patients; in addition, we are planning to perform a follow-up analysis to investigate the quality of life of surviving patients.
Analysis of risk factors and a plan for actions allow to improve a program for ECMO transport of persons affected by ALI or ARDS to a referring centre. In order to achieve this goal, four factors seem to be crucial: identification of a vehicle with specific tech features, systematic and precise settings of equipment, a toolsystem to sort out equipment and a dedicated training program for nurses involved in these missions.",Mobile ECMO team for inter-hospital transportation of patients with ARDS: a retrospective case series,"Lucchini, A; De Felippis, C; Elli, S; Gariboldi, R; Vimercati, S; Tundo, P; Bondi, H; Costa, M C",Heart Lung Vessel,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4246845/,196,2232,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

→What this article adds: The use of 10 cm H2O PEEP can lead to a reduction in the incidence of atelectasis, intubation time at the ICU and length of ICU and hospital stay. Given that this level of PEEP is effective, this method is recommended to be used in postoperative care of patients.
Background: The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can have an important role as one of the ways to prevent and treat atelectasis, but it seems that there is still no consensus about its beneficial level. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different levels of PEEP on the incidence of atelectasis after heart surgery.
Methods: This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial that was adopted from a research project recorded in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials. This paper is the result of a research project undertaken at Fatemeh Zahra Hospital (Mazandaran Heart Center) in 2015. 180 patients underwent open heart surgery were selected and were divided randomly into three groups: control, PEEP=8, and PEEP=10 (60 in each group). The patients in the two PEEP8 and PEEP10 intervention groups separately received 8 cm H2O and 10 cm H2O PEEP, respectively, 30 minutes after admission to the ICU for 4 hours and then received 5 cm H2O PEEP until extubation. Atelectasis was examined two hours after the extubation and on the third day after surgery.
Results: The incidence rates of atelectasis two hours after extubation on the first day of surgery were 22 (36.7%), 20 (33.3%) and 10 (16.7%) patients in the control, PEEP8 and PEEP10 groups, respectively. The differences were statistically significant among the three groups (p=0.035). The incidence rates of atelectasis on the third day after surgery were 39 (65%), 36 (60%) and 21 (35%) patients in the control, PEEP8 and PEEP10 groups, respectively. The differences were also statistically significant among the three groups (p=0.003).
Conclusion: The use of 10 cm H2O PEEP can lead to a reduction in the incidence of atelectasis, intubation time at the ICU and length of ICU and hospital stay. Given that this level of PEEP is effective, this method is recommended to be used in postoperative care of patients.

The prophylactic effect of different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure on the incidence rate of atelectasis after cardiac surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Med J Islam Repub Iran.","Pulmonary complication is one of the most important and serious early problems after heart surgery (1, 2), which is a major cause of prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare costs and mortality (3) . Some of the pulmonary complications after heart surgery include ate-lectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome (4, 5) .
Atelectasis is one of the most common respiratory complications after open-heart surgery. Its prevalence after heart surgeries has been reported Up to 78% of pulmonary http://mjiri.iums.ac.ir Med J Islam Repub Iran. 2018(10 Mar);32:20.
2 complications (6) . The incidence of atelectasis after heart surgery has been reported 75% in an Iranian study (7) . Atelectasis is characterized by the collapse of the alveoli, lobules or larger unit respiratory systems that occurs after thoracic surgeries due to reasons such as uneven distribution of ventilation and perfusion due to factors such as anesthesia (8, 9) , extracorporeal circulation, sternotomy, analgesics (8, 10) , respiratory muscle dysfunction (9) , post-operative pain, drainage (11) , decreased phrenic nerve activity and diaphragmatic dysfunction (4, 12) , which lung volumes are reduced, and atelectasis happens then. The importance of postoperative atelectasis is due to the absence of obvious clinical symptoms, and therefore it does not attract the attention of medical personnel and healthcare staff. In addition, it is progressive and can lead to other pulmonary complications such as nosocomial pneumonia and subsequent increase in the length of hospital stay as well as rising costs for healthcare systems (3, 13) .
To prevent and treat pulmonary complications after heart surgery, various methods have been proposed, including active respiratory physiotherapy such as deep breathing along with coughing, incentive spirometry, frequent change of position in bed and faster ambulation of patients, as well as passive methods such as intermittent positive-pressure breathing (IPPB), positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (14) . Given the simultaneous use of all active respiratory physiotherapy procedures, the high incidence rate of atelectasis after heart surgery is still reported in patients (7, 15) . One of these methods that are utilized less as a preventive operation is the use of PEEP in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit or during recovery. PEEP is applied along with an increase in respiratory factors, lung volumes and improved gas and alveolar exchanges (16, 17) , and is recommended for the main treatment of collapse created in patients under anesthesia with healthy lungs (18, 19) , atelectasis treatment and improved arterial oxygenation (20, 21) . Some studies on the benefits of PEEP different levels reported that elevated values could lead to a reduction in ventilator duration and increased survival odds ratio (22) . A study on the adverse effects of high levels (PEEP>10 cm of water) reported an increase in ventilation duration, prolonged intubation (23) and increased length of hospitalization (24) . This complication in above studies resulting from the use of PEEP was equal to 30 cm of water. Some of the articles pointed out the lack of difference among different levels (25) (26) (27) . Meanwhile, most of the studies examined patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and no studies have been done on other cardiac surgical patients. Moreover, the application of PEEP is raised as an effective therapeutic method and is used less as a preventive method for all patients.
It appears that one of the ways to prevent atelectasis is the use of positive end-expiratory pressure for all eligible patients that can be a preventive way, but not for treatment. Based on our recent review of literature, no study has been published on the effect of different levels of PEEP as a preventive measure for eligible patients.
Considering the high incidence of atelectasis following open heart surgery in spite of using active and passive breathing exercises and taking into account the impact of increased PEEP levels on respiratory, lung capacity, improved gas and alveolar exchange as well as pulmonary volumes, this study was conducted to determine the effect of different PEEP levels on the incidence rate of atelectasis, pulmonary function, length of intubation duration and length of hospitalization to improve the mentioned complications.
This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial that was adopted from a research project and thesis in the field of critical care nursing approved by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Iran (No.1855 on 21/07/2015) It has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT201507307494N14), and obtained the code of ethics committee (IR.MAZUMS.REC.94-1855). Study population was composed of all of the patients who had undergone an open-heart surgery and were hospitalized in either cardiac surgical ward or post-cardiac surgery intensive care unit at Fatemeh Zahra Hospital (Mazandaran Heart Center, Sari, Iran) during September 2015 -February 2016. Sample size was calculated to include at least 55 subjects in each group according to the similar article and the incidence rate of atelectasis (28) , using the following formula and considering a minimal difference of 25% between the two groups, α=0.05, β=0.20, p 1 = 0.50 in the control group, and p 2 =0.25 in the experimental group. ) (
Considering a dropout rate of 30%, the sample size increased to 77 individuals, which was then further rounded up to 80 (per group) to enhance the accuracy. According to our CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1) , after the dropout, each group ended up to contain 60 samples.
After legal procedures and obtaining necessary approvals from the authorities and ethics committees at Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, referring to Mazandaran Heart Center, the patients were selected. Using accessible sampling and a random-number table patients were randomly assigned into three groups: control (PEEP= 5), PEEP= 8 and PEEP= 10. Researcher reviewed the list of patients waiting for heart surgery, interviewed the patients and explained about this survey. Consent was taken from the patients after having inclusion criteria.
Inclusion criteria were non-emergency open heart surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, heart valve replacement, combined with sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques), age range of 18-65 years, lack of ejection fraction less than 30% in the preoperative an- 3 giography sheet due to its negative effects on the patient's breathing pattern, no history of chronic lung disease and any damage to the lungs, no previous history of open heart or lung surgery, no history of rib fractures and chest tube, no history of head or nasal trauma, neurologic disease history and frequent sinus infections.
Exclusion criteria included history of chemotherapy, the use of immunosuppressants during three months prior to surgery, arterial systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg despite fluid intake, arterial PH less than 7.30, arterial carbon dioxide pressure over 50 mmHg, arterial oxygen saturation less than 80% despite receiving supplemental oxygen, blood hemoglobin less than 7 g/dl after surgery, serum creatinine over 3.5 mg/dl and body mass index (BMI) over 40 kg/m 2 due to increased risk of developing postoperative respiratory complications, as well as postoperative hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg), aortic clamp time over 150 minutes, cardiopulmonary bypass time over 240 minutes, use of intra-and postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), intubated for more than 24 hours, retransmission to the operating room, require ventilation -therapeutic protocol and hypotension after intervention up to 10 mmHg of baseline blood pressure. The participants were allocated in three groups of PEEP8, PEEP10, and control using Excel's RANDBETWEEN function. Each group was identified by a letter: A to PEEP8, B to PEEP10, and C to control group. 180 envelopes were sequentially numbered from 1 to 180 for three groups. Each opaque and sealed envelope contained a letter (A, B, or C) randomly selected using RANDBETWEEN function of Excel. This procedure was carried out by someone not involved in the project. The first eligible patient was designated as number one, and the envelope numbered one was then opened, and the patient was allocated to one of the three groups based on the letter contained in the envelope. The data 4 gathering tool consisted of demographic questionnaire, medical and surgical questionnaires, which the researcher recorded all of them. The demographic and medical information were age, sex, smoking, and body mass index. Data on surgical and postoperative status included the type of surgery (vessels, valves, combined), number of grafted vessels, duration of surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic clamp time, number of chest tubes, duration of mechanical ventilation in the ICU, duration of intubation and atelectasis on chest x-ray, which were collected through patient records and during the process of patient care and the mentioned questionnaire. Before the intervention, the incidence rate of atelectasis was measured in all three groups. The patients in control group by having the inclusion criteria and 30 minutes after admission to ICU received 5 cm H 2 O PEEP until extubation according to routine care. The patients in the two PEEP8 and PEEP10 intervention groups separately received 8 cm H 2 O PEEP and 10 cm H 2 O PEEP, respectively, 30 minutes after admission to the ICU for 4 hours in the absence of impairment of the hemodynamic status and then had 5 cm H 2 O PEEP until extubation. The incidence rate of atelectasis two hours after extubation and on the third postoperative day (72 hours after surgery) was recorded. None of the routine care in all three groups was omitted, but the entire health care was tried to be done. The initial consequence was atelectasis, as interpreted by a radiologist based on chest X-ray radiography. The secondary consequences included intubation time in postcardiac surgery intensive care unit, length of ICU and hospital stay.
The researcher collected the required information and followed up the patients in all three groups. Since the patients and radiologists, who interpreted the chest X ray, were unaware of the type of intervention and grouping, the study was considered as double-blind trial. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 software through descriptive statistic such as frequency, mean, standard deviation and analytical statistics, ANOVA, Chi-square, McNemar's and repeated measures ANOVA tests. A pvalue <0.05 was considered significant in this study
After excluding 23 patients from the control group, 18 from PEEP8 group and 17 from PEEP10 group, 60 patients were finally analyzed in each group. Comparison of demographic variables among the groups indicates that the data for age, sex, body mass index and smoking were not significantly different (Table 1 ).
In addition, there was no statistically significant difference among the three groups for variables associated with surgery including type of surgery, number of chest tubes, number of grafted vessels, duration of anesthesia, duration of aortic clamping and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass pump ( Table 2) .
The chest x-ray results showed significant difference among the three groups for incidence of atelectasis two hours after extubation (p<0.05). There was a difference between the control group (22 patients, 36.7%) and the intervention group of PEEP10 (10 patients, 16.7%) (p=0.03). This comparison indicated significant difference between the intervention group of PEEP8 (20 patients, On the third day after surgery, the incidence rate of atelectasis had statistically significant difference between the intervention group of PEEP10 (21 patients, 35%) and the control group (39 patients, 65%) (p= 0.001), as well as between the intervention groups of PEEP10 and PEEP8, 36 patients (60%) (p= 0.02). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the PEEP8 group and the control group (p= 0.79) ( Table 3) . According to Table 4 , the incidence rate of atelectasis in the two times studied in each of the three groups showed that the incidence rate of atelectasis in the control group on the third day after surgery (n= 39, 65%), with one case improvement and 18 new cases, was significantly diufferent based on McNemar's test compared with the time of two hours after extubation (n= 22, 36.6%), (p<0.001). In addition, the incidence rate of atelectasis in the PEEP8 group on the third day after surgery (n= 36, 60%), with four cases improvement and 20 new cases, was significantly different compared with a time of two hours after extubation (n= 20, 33.3%), (p< 0.001). Nevertheless, the incidence rate of atelectasis in the PEEP10 group on the third day after surgery (n= 21, 35%), with eight cases improvement and 19 new cases, was not significantly different based on McNemar's test compared with a time of two hours after extubation (n= 10, 16.6%) (p<0.001) ( Table 4) .
Tukey post hoc test revealed statistically significant difference for the mean (SD) duration of intubation in the ICU between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the control group (p<0.001), as well as between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the intervention group of PEEP8 (p<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the intervention group of PEEP8 and the control group (p=0.97). The mean (SD) duration of stay in ICU had statistically significant difference between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the control group (p<0.001), as well as between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the intervention group of PEEP8 (p<0.001); but no significant difference was found between the intervention group of PEEP8 and the control group (p=0.36). Moreover, considering the duration of hospitalization, there was a statistical significant difference between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the control group (p<0.001), as well as between the intervention group of PEEP10 and the intervention group of PEEP8 (p<0.001). Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between the intervention group of PEEP8 and the control group (p=0.91). The data have been shown in Table 5 .
The results of this study demonstrated that the prophylactic use of 10 cm H 2 O PEEP in patients with mechanical 6 ventilation in the ICU after heart surgery can lead to a significant reduction in the incidence rate of atelectasis after extubation on the first and third days after surgery. It seems that using this level of PEEP prevents the collapse of the airways, high functional residual capacity (FRC), improved alveolar performance with increased pressure and volume of the alveoli (29) as well as elevated pulmonary compliance (30) . However, 8 cm H 2 O PEEP and 5 cm H 2 O PEEP had no significant effect in reducing the incidence rate of atelectasis. In a similar study on the effect of 5 cm H 2 O PEEP and 10 cm H 2 O PEEP after coronary artery bypass surgery, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of atelectasis incidence. Thus, some degree of atelectasis was found among the intervention (26.7%) and the control (56.7%) groups that the level of 10 cm H 2 O PEEP reduced the incidence rate of atelectasis, which is in line with the present study. Compared with our study, in the mentioned study the patients in the intervention group did not receive constant PEEP, but the rate varied between 5 to 10 cm of water until tracheal extubation depending on the patient's condition. In addition, the patients in the control group received PEEP less than 5 cm of water. However, in our study, all patients in the control group received at least 5 cm H 2 O PEEP ; this could be the reasons for the high percentages in both intervention and control groups in the above study compared with the present study (28) . In another study on the effect of PEEP on respiratory function after heart surgery in three groups, the patients experienced three levels of PEEP including 0, 5 and 10-15 cm of water after heart surgery. The results showed that the PEEP levels of less than 10 cm H 2 O had no effect on the reopening of the lungs with atelectasis, which is in line with the above study. The difference of the current research with the above study design is the use of various levels and periods of PEEP. Thus, the PEEP in the mentioned study was applied 3 to 5 hours after admission in the ICU until extubation, and the patients did not receive PEEP greater than 10 cm of water within the constant time so that the patients were given PEEP for 15 minutes and again after 20 minutes of pause. In the present study, the patients received 8 or 10 cm H 2 O PEEP for a maximum of 4 hours continuously, which the time remained constant for all samples (31) . A prospective clinical trial that was carried out on non-hypoxic patients connected to mechanical ventilation with normal chest X-ray showed that 0, 5 or 8 cm H 2 O PEEP levels had no effect on the incidence of atelectasis; it is in line with the present study. The results of the study showed that the levels of 5 to 8 cm H 2 O PEEP improved hypoxia and reduced the incidence rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the patients. Unlike the present study the patients did not undergo heart surgery, but the patients in the general and trauma intensive care units were studied (32) .
PEEP has a specific effect on improving pulmonary compliance that is effective in preventing atelectasis (30) . It seems that the best special effects of PEEP are applied via the ventilator when using endotracheal tube in the ICU, not after extubation and with non-invasive methods; because according to some studies on cardiac surgical patients, the use of similar methods of positive pressure ventilation via face mask such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and inspiratory resistance-positive expiratory pressure (IR-PEP), which are non-invasive ventilation, did not show clinical effects (33, 34) .
Another study investigated the effects of PEEP in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery at three levels of 0, 5 and 10 cm H 2 O. These levels had no effect on the incidence of atelectasis (35) , contrary to the present findings. In this study, the incidence of atelectasis was measured on the fifth day after surgery; the sample size in their three groups was 44 people. In the present study, the incidence of atelectasis was measured on the first and third days and the sample size was 180; this seems to be the reason for the differences in the results. It also appears that the mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass in above study was much longer than the present study; prolongation of bypass duration is directly related to the incidence of pulmonary complications after heart surgery, including atelectasis (6) .
Comparison of the atelectasis findings in each group between two hours after extubation and on the third day after surgery indicated that the incidence of 18 new cases of atelectasis in group PEEP5, but 20 new cases of atelectasis in group PEEP8 on the third day after surgery than two hours after extubation was statistically significant. It seems that 8 cm H 2 O PEEP was not effective for 4 hours and had no significant difference with the control group receiving 5 cm H 2 O PEEP. The duration of 8 cm H 2 O PEEP should also be increased to be effective.
The present study demonstrated that the duration of mechanical ventilation in the ICU had significantly decreased in patients who received 10 cm H 2 O PEEP compared to the control group and the group received 8 cm H 2 O PEEP. This decline might be due to better levels of arterial oxygenation in ICU after heart surgery in early times by applying 10 cm H 2 O PEEP. Many studies have confirmed that high levels of PEEP can improve arterial oxygenation after heart surgery (22, 23, 25) .
Based on the results of a study on the influence of 5 cm H 2 O PEEP and 8 cm H 2 O PEEP after heart surgery, duration of intubation in the ICU had no differences between the two groups (25) . This result is consistent with the present study and the duration was reduced only in the 10 cm H 2 O PEEP group. Another study on PEEP following coronary artery bypass grafting reported that levels over 10 cm H 2 O PEEP increased ventilation duration (23), contrary to our results. This difference seems to be due to the fact that the average age is an important factor in the delayed extubation and in an increase of connectivity to ventilator after heart surgery (36) . In the mentioned study, the average age in the group with high levels of PEEP was equal to 65±8 years; but in the present study, age over 65 years was one of the exclusion criteria.
In the current study, there were significant differences between the incidence rate of atelectasis after extubation on the first day and on the third day, duration of intubation, length of ICU stay and hospitalization in PEEP10 group compared with the control and the PEEP8 groups. Considering the history of cardiac surgery and the advent of subsequent novel care methods, we can also see the incidence of atelectasis as common pulmonary complications. Although numerous research have been done on the effect of PEEP in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, its effects on respiratory function in patients after heart surgery has been less published. Researchers still have not reached a clear consensus on the effective level and duration of its use after heart surgery as a preventive action.
Based on current literature, no study investigated the three levels of PEEP as a preventive measure to avoid atelectasis incidence after heart surgery. Therefore, there are needs for further studies in this area. Future studies on the duration of PEEP more than four hours is recommended.
Limitations of this study included failure to control pain and anxiety in the patients as confounding variables until the third day after surgery, inability to use identified heart surgeon and anesthesiologist, failure to recruit a specified physiotherapist due to their different skills in physiotherapy; These limitations were outside the control of the researcher.
The results revealed that the use of 10 cm H 2 O PEEP as a preventive measure had a significant impact in decreasing the incidence of atelectasis, and reducing the duration of intubation in the ICU in the early period after heart surgery. Considering the advantages of PEEP at this level including ease of use, cost-effectiveness, lack of physical fatigue, no need for patient cooperation, easy implementation and low risk, it is recommended to use this method in conjunction with other conventional techniques for preventing respiratory complications after heart surgery.",The prophylactic effect of different levels of positive endexpiratory pressure on the incidence rate of atelectasis after cardiac surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Setak-Berenjestanaki, Mostafa; Bagheri-Nesami, Masoumeh; Gholipour Baradari, Afshin; Mousavinasab, Seyed Nouraddin; Ghaffari, Rahman; Darbeheshti, Manijeh",Med J Islam Repub Iran,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6108254/,440,3713,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this number, Korea becomes second only to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the ranking of cumulative MERS cases. In this paper Korea's unique experience of an outbreak of MERS will be summarized and discussed briefly.","Since the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea) began on May 11, 2015, a total of 186 persons have been infected by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 38 of whom have died [1] . Korea is thus second only to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the ranking of cumulative MERS cases. As the MERS epidemic in Korea has been considered a public health emergency, crisis, or disaster, several policy suggestions for public health system reform are now under discussion [2] . In this paper the unique characteristics of the public health system and social phenomena associated with the MERS outbreak outside the Middle East will be summarized and discussed briefly.
It is worth evaluating the major reasons for the rapid spread of MERS-CoV in Korea. Several health care system issues seem to be linked with the rapid transmission of MERS-CoV that oc- [3] . These factors included lack of awareness among health care professionals and the public about new emerging infectious disease like MERS; weakness in preventing and controlling healthcare associated infections in hospitals; close and prolonged contact of infected MERS patients in crowded emergency rooms and multibed rooms in hospitals; the system permitting patients' free choices in seeking care (known as ""doctor or hospital shopping""); the custom of family members and visitors spending time with infected patients in hospital rooms facilitating the secondary spread of infections among contacts. In a thought experiment, these factors can modelled like the holes in slices of Swiss cheese [4] . In this model the holes in any one ""slice"" do not normally lead to an accident, as the accident is curtailed elsewhere in the system. A bad outcome can occur only when the holes, that is, the risk factors in many slices momentarily line up to permit an accident the opportunity to take a straight trajectory through the layers. In this case the failure of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) to control the MERS outbreak in its early stage can be regarded as one hole in one slice. Korea still had to take countermea-
sures to remove or reduce the holes in many other slices in order to effectively prepare against future emerging infectious diseases including MERS. The WHO sent a high-level message to the Korean government including 11 recommendations [5] . These recommendations can serve as references in redesigning the health care and public health systems in Korea.
It is also worth asking to why the socioeconomic impact of the outbreak in Korea was so great. The numbers of infections and deaths (objective component of risk) from MERS-CoV were smaller than the numbers of those from tuberculosis or seasonal influenza. In spite of this fact, the public's perceived threat (subjective component of risk) caused by MERS was much more serious than those of other infectious diseases. The MERS epidemic was not a simple public health problem to Koreans at that time, but showed implications for the state of the overall economy and society beyond the health sector in Korea. One cause of this difference in perception was that the KCDC did not follow the outbreak communication guidelines proposed by the WHO. The guidelines emphasize the importance of winning the public's trust, making announcements as early as possible, providing information transparently, and promoting understanding among the civil society [6] . The failure in risk communication during this outbreak resulted in the public's overreaction to the outbreak [7, 8] . At the outbreak's peak, thousands of schools and kindergartens were temporarily closed and many public events were cancelled or suspended. The WHO recommended the Korean government to reopen schools, as there has been no linkage of MERS transmission with school attendance in Korea or elsewhere [5] . The number of foreign tourists decreased by 41% compared with the same month of the previous year. Korea lost US$10 billion, which is expected to cut 0.1% off the gross domestic product growth rate in 2015. This enormous social cost reflects the importance of risk communication during infectious disease outbreaks. The WHO also recommended that the Korean government should improve risk communication. Now the Korean government has a plan to establish a new unit in charge of risk communication and management within the KCDC.
What are the ethical and legal issues related to various public health measures used for controlling the MERS outbreak such as surveillance, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine? Gostin et al. [9] argued that it becomes essential to develop a set of legal and ethical recommendations, especially when scientific evidence is not enough and public health action is urgently required as in the case of severe acute respiratory syn-drome (SARS). During the MERS outbreak in Korea, difficult choices between public health needs and the protection of individual rights, which include privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement, had to be made. Gostin et al. [9] proposed four ethical values: the precautionary principle, the least restrictive option, fairness, and transparency in decision making. It is unclear that these values were fully considered in the public health actions that were taken during the MERS outbreak in Korea. The Korean government strictly restricted the movement of 16 752 individuals who satisfied the operational definition of ""close contacts with a MERS patient"" within designated hospitals or their homes for the maximum incubation period regardless of whether they displayed MERS symptoms [1] . According to the WHO, there is no evidence that MERS can be transmitted before symptom development or in early symptomatic stages. Therefore the WHO does not recommend quarantine nor isolation of asymptomatic contacts during this period [10] . The urgent social demand for controlling the MERS outbreak overwhelmed the issue of legitimacy of the public health interventions taken by the government. Economic issues have also been raised regarding this restriction of movement. In this situation, the people who undertake the costs incurred by movement restriction are not the same people who benefit. In principle, if those who benefited were to compensate those who were made worse off, the outcome could have been considered an improvement (known as a ""Kaldor-Hicks improvement"") [11] . For effective and fair implementation of public health measures against MERS or other transmissible infectious diseases that compromise individual rights, a reasonable compensation scheme for the victims, including for health care providers, should be designed to benefit those individuals and society overall.",Costly Lessons From the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Outbreak in Korea,"Lee, Sang-il",J Prev Med Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4676647/,75,1058,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have led to cooperation between countries, the first international epidemic response conference in 1851 and the establishment of WHO in 1948.
EIDs are diseases that have appeared recently or that have recently increased in frequency, geographical distribution or both (1) . Since the end of the 20th century, there has been a constant stream of newly identified pathogens and an increasing occurrence of pandemic threats to global health (2) . EIDs threaten public health and are sustained by increasing global commerce, travel and disruption of ecological systems and in particular urbanization. Urbanization is characterized by rapid intensification of agriculture, socioeconomic change, and ecological fragmentation, which can have profound impacts on the epidemiology of infectious disease (5). However, their interactions with travel and migrations are less well known.
Travelers could play a role in importing EIDs and could be a sentinel of major epidemics.
In France, there are more than 20 million travelers every year, 4.5 million of which are destined for areas at high risk for health. There are several modes of travel: tourist, business or visiting friends and relatives. Trips can be very short or extended in time.
Infectious diseases are rare health events, with the exception of common infectious diseases such as traveler's diarrhea and are a single cause of death, far behind accidents and cardiovascular disease (6) .
The risk of emerging infections such as dengue in a risk zone was estimated at 1% for one month of travel (7).
We have seen (re-)emergence of diseases imported by travellers in Europe, such as chikungunya and dengue in France and Itay, and malaria in Greece (8) (9) (10) . Apart from these examples, these are rare situations. However, with global travel growth, the risk could become more tangible (11) .
A particular concern is that of Multidrug Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MRE) carriage. MRE acquisition is very frequent among travellers to tropical regions (12) . The acquisition was higher in Asia (72%) than in sub-Saharan Africa (48%) or Latin America (31%). However, the same study showed that MRE carriage was limited in time and disappeared after a few months.
Migration is a global phenomenon that influences the health of individuals and populations over the course of their lives (13) . Migrants are special travellers who, in most case, do not migrate by choice. Migrants are considered at higher risk for a range of health problems including infectious diseases as HIV, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and malaria (14, 15) . This higher risk is partly due to poor socioeconomic conditions and, in some countries, is due to the lack of rights to health coverage for undocumented migrants (16) (17) (18) (19) .
Existing evidence from different European countries highlights the difficulties to access health services that migrants are facing (20) (21) (22) (23) . These infectious diseases unequally expose the majority Nicolas Vignier, Olivier Bouchaud Travel, migration and emerging infectious diseases population, from none at all (e.g., malaria) to a little (e.g., tuberculosis).
One can take the examples of epidemics of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -MersCov-and Ebola, for which no secondary case has been reported in France.
Among the published studies on migrants and infectious diseases, the majority were non-emergent diseases with the exception of MDR tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant bacteria (24, 25) .
In connection with the increased use of antibiotics in low-resource countries, there is a worrying increase in the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria (26, 27) . This increase could lead to an increased risk for migrants and their relatives, but there are few data on this point (28) . The risk seems particularly increased when they return home to visit friends and relatives (29) . While antimicrobial resistance is of concern, the prospects for pandemic spread of a bacterial or fungal emerging pathogen by migrants seem less likely (30) .
Endemic disease, as tuberculosis, impose a far higher public health burden than epidemic disease (31) . Denmark experienced an increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in the 1990s in relation to the increase in the number of cases among migrants (32) . The rate of tuberculosis in France is 10 times higher among immigrants than in the majority population. Refugees and asylum seekers may have a heightened risk of MDR-TB infection and worse outcomes but the data remains poor (33) .
Thus, there is little evidence to support the theories by which migrants would expose the host population to significant infectious risk. However, human diseases acquire a social status based on their perceived risk that determines their acceptability (31) .
In a study that we conducted with a number of 347 doctors in France (infectious diseases and general practitioners), they were asked if firsttime migrant people represent a vector of infectious diseases different from the majority population: 8% answered no, 13% yes but weakly, 44% yes but moderately, 27% yes significantly and 9% did not know.
Thereby, apart from infections such as tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant bacteria, the introduction of EIDs into human populations seems to be more often a consequence of economic development that brings zoonotic reservoirs in closer proximity to people.
Indeed, most pandemic threats are caused by viruses from either zoonotic sources or vectorborne sources (30) . There is a need for rapid diagnosis of EIDs. Systems biology approaches can lead to a greater understanding of EIDs pathogenesis and facilitate the evaluation of newly developed vaccine-induced immunity in a timely manner (30, 34) .
Close collaboration is therefore needed between specialists in tropical medicine, in public health, immunologists and biologists to anticipate the risk of EIDs in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015 (35).
The WHO established a Department of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases in 2011 to better prepare for and respond to EIDs.
In conclusion, in connection with the extension of poverty, urbanization, extensive livestock rearing and globalization, we could be exposed to a third epidemiological transition characterized by zoonotic diseases and infections with multidrugresistant bacteria (36) .
The risk appears low for EIDs, or very low for high-risk EIDs, but higher for MRE carriage with possibly limited consequences. The role played by migrants is weaker than imagined (except for tuberculosis).

156,71b1e5b3dcbccd130699fbbdbc537a66a24598bc,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus infecting humans that is associated with acute pneumonia, occasional renal failure, and a high mortality rate and is considered a threat to public health. The construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here, providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates. Following transfection with the cDNA clone, infectious virus was rescued in both Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells. Recombinant MERS-CoVs (rMERS-CoVs) lacking the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were successfully rescued from cDNA clones with these genes deleted. The mutant viruses presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that accessory genes were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures. In contrast, an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural E protein (rMERS-CoV-⌬E) was not successfully rescued, since viral infectivity was lost at early passages. Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV-⌬E genome replicated after cDNA clone was transfected into cells.
IMPORTANCE Since the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula during the summer of 2012, it has already spread to 10 different countries, infecting around 94 persons and showing a mortality rate higher than 50%. This article describes the development of the first reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV, based on the construction of an infectious cDNA clone inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome. Using this system, a collection of rMERS-CoV deletion mutants has been generated. Interestingly, one of the mutants with the E gene deleted was a replication-competent, propagation-defective virus that could only be grown in the laboratory by providing E protein in trans, whereas it would only survive a single virus infection cycle in vivo. This virus constitutes a vaccine candidate that may represent a balance between safety and efficacy for the induction of mucosal immunity, which is needed to prevent MERS-CoV infection. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus as a vaccine candidate. mBio 4(5):e00650-13.","likely have not required hospital assistance. In fact, recent data suggest that mild respiratory illness might also be part of the clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection (3) . In addition to mild or acute respiratory illness, other reported clinical symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea, fever, and in some cases, renal failure (9) . Many hospitalized cases occurred in persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or immunosuppression (3, 13) . The virus loads are highest in lower respiratory tract samples, although low concentrations of viral RNA can also be found in stool, urine, and blood samples (12) .
The genome of MERS-CoV includes more than 30,100 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, S, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, E, M, and N), 9 of which seem to be expressed from a nested set of eight mRNAs (14, 15) . Interestingly, the partial genome sequences of three independent MERS-CoV isolates reveal that it evolved following a strict molecular clock model (6) .
A functional receptor of MERS-CoV is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) from both human and bat (16) . This receptor binds to a 231-residue region in the spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV (17, 18) , a domain different from the receptor-binding site of other Betacoronaviruses (18) . Infection of human airways by MERS-CoV prevents the induction of interferon-regulating factor 3 (IRF-3)mediated antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-␣/␤) responses. However, MERS-CoV was markedly more sensitive to the antiviral state established by ectopic IFN than severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) (14, 19, 20) .
Soon after MERS-CoV emergence, a diagnostic assay was designed (21) . Similarly, antivirals inhibiting virus replication, such as cyclosporine A, IFN-␣, or ribavirin, have been described (14, 22, 23) . In contrast, reliable vaccines have not yet been developed, although the S protein and the receptor-binding site within this protein induce neutralizing antibodies and, in principle, could serve as a subunit vaccine (17) . CoVs infect respiratory and enteric mucosal areas, and thus, induction of mucosal immunity is necessary to protect these tissues from infection. Live attenuated viruses are expected to elicit mucosal immunity more efficiently than nonreplicating antigens, which elicit reduced secretory immune responses. Live attenuated viruses can be generated by the deletion of genes conferring virulence, a procedure that requires the availability of a reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV. In this article, we describe the construction of an infectious cDNA clone of MERS-CoV using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Using this clone, recombinant MERS-CoV (rMERS-CoV) deletion mutants were constructed lacking genes nonessential for virus replication. In addition, we deleted the structural envelope (E) protein gene, because in previous work from our laboratory, deletion of the E gene in two other CoVs led to mutants that were either replication-competent, propagation-defective viruses or attenuated viruses (24) (25) (26) . All deletion mutants efficiently replicated and spread in cell cultures except the one in which the E gene was deleted, which was replication competent but propagation defective. This virus was propagated in cells by providing E protein in trans. Therefore, this deletion mutant missing the E gene can serve as the basis for a safe vaccine candidate.
An infectious cDNA clone was assembled as a BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early pro-moter, based on the genome sequence of the MERS-CoV-EMC12 strain (GenBank accession number JX869059) (15) . To this end, the same approach described for the generation of other CoV infectious cDNA clones (27) (28) (29) (30) was used. This system allows the efficient intracellular production of viral RNA from the cDNA clone without the need for in vitro ligation and transcription steps.
The BAC clone carrying the MERS-CoV infectious cDNA was generated in several steps (Fig. 1) . After selection of appropriate restriction sites in the viral genome (Fig. 1A) , the intermediate plasmid pBAC-MERS-5=3= (Fig. 1B) was generated as the backbone to assemble the full-length cDNA clone. This plasmid contained the first 811 nucleotides of the viral genome fused to the CMV promoter, a multicloning site containing the restriction sites selected in the first step (BamHI, StuI, SwaI, and PacI), and the last 4,272 nucleotides of the genome, followed by a 25nucleotide (nt) poly(A) stretch, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme, and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation sequences. Finally, the full-length MERS-CoV infectious cDNA clone (pBAC-MERS FL ) was assembled by sequential cloning of four chemically synthesized overlapping DNA fragments (MERS-1 to MERS-4) into the plasmid pBAC-MERS-5=3= (Fig. 1C) . The full-length clone sequence was identical to that reported for the MERS-CoV-EMC12 strain (15) , with the exception of a silent point mutation (T to C) introduced in the cDNA at position 20,761 (Fig. 1C ). This mutation, which eliminates an additional SwaI restriction site at position 20,760, was introduced to facilitate the cloning process and was used as a genetic marker to identify the virus recovered from the cDNA clone.
The assembled infectious cDNA clone was stable during its propagation in Escherichia coli DH10B cells for more than 200 generations, as determined by restriction endonuclease analysis (data not shown).
Rescue of infectious rMERS-CoV from the cDNA clone in Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells. Infectious viruses were recovered from the full-length cDNA clone, using susceptible Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells, with titers of around 10 6 PFU/ml at 72 h posttransfection (h.p.t.). The recovered viruses were cloned by three rounds of plaque purification, and their phenotypic and genotypic properties were determined. Viruses rescued from both cell lines (rMERS-CoV) induced a clear cytopathic effect (CPE), characterized by the induction of cell fusion, which was more apparent in Huh-7 cells (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the replication of the rMERS-CoV was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a nucleocapsid (N) protein-specific antibody, showing a cytoplasmic staining pattern in both cell lines (Fig. 2) .
To further confirm the identity of the rMERS-CoV, the fulllength genome sequences of two independent clones rescued in Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells were analyzed. The recombinant viruses rescued in Huh-7 cells presented the same sequence as the cDNA clone, including the genetic marker at position 20,761. However, in the case of the viruses rescued in Vero A66 cells, several changes in the region of the accessory genes were detected in both clones. One of them presented a deletion of 179 nucleotides (from nucleotide 26,721 to 26,900) that disrupted gene 4b and eliminated the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) and the first 20 amino acids of gene 5. The second clone presented a 1-base insertion at position 27,143 that changed the reading frame and promoted the expression of a truncated gene 5. Taking these data into consideration, two new virus clones rescued in Vero A66 cells were sequenced, and only one of them presented the wild-type sequence, suggesting that the MERS-CoV was more stable in Huh-7 cells. Therefore, Huh-7 cells were selected for further work.
Rescue of infectious rMERS-CoVs lacking accessory genes 3, 4a and 4b, and 5. The availability of the pBAC-MERS FL infectious clone opened the door to investigate the importance of accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 for MERS-CoV replication. To this end, cDNA clones with genes 3 (pBAC-MERS-⌬3), 4a and 4b (pBAC-MERS-⌬4ab), or 5 (pBAC-MERS-⌬5) deleted were constructed from pBAC-MERS FL (Fig. 3A) . The expression of gene 3 was abrogated by deletion of its TRS and coding sequence, with the exception of the 3= last 41 nucleotides, containing the 4a TRS, in order to preserve the expression of gene 4a. In the case of genes 4a and 4b, the majority of both coding sequences was deleted, except for the last 81 nucleotides of gene 4b, which overlap the gene 5 TRS. Finally, the expression of gene 5 was avoided by deletion of its TRS and complete coding sequence.
Infectious viruses were recovered in Huh-7 cells from plasmids pBAC-MERS-⌬3, pBAC-MERS-⌬4ab, and pBAC-MERS-⌬5 with virus titers similar to that of the parental rMERS-CoV (around 10 6 PFU/ml). After one passage on fresh cell monolayers, the recombinant viruses were cloned by three plaque isolation steps and their genetic structure was confirmed by sequencing. All the deletion mutant viruses (rMERS-CoV-⌬3, rMERS-CoV-⌬4ab, and rMERS-CoV-⌬5) were identical to the parental virus (rMERS-CoV) in terms of CPE and plaque morphology (data not shown). The growth kinetics of these viruses were also similar, reaching maximum virus titers at 72 h postinfection (h.p.i.) (Fig. 3B ). In the case of rMERS-CoV-⌬4ab, the viral titer was around 10-fold lower than that obtained from the parental virus (Fig. 3B ). These data indicated that the proteins encoded by genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures.
Generation of a rMERS-CoV mutant lacking the structural E protein gene. Based on published data showing that the deletion of CoV E protein resulted in either replication-competent, propagation-defective viruses (24) or attenuated viruses (25, 26, 31) , a cDNA clone with the E gene deleted (pBAC-MERS-⌬E) was constructed from pBAC-MERS FL . The expression of the E gene was abrogated by the deletion of its TRS and coding sequence, with the exception of the 3= last 49 nucleotides, in order to preserve the expression of gene M (Fig. 4A ). To recover infectious virus, BHK cells were transfected with pBAC-MERS-⌬E or the full-length cDNA clone pBAC-MERS FL . Six h.p.t. the transfected cells were overlayed on Vero A66 cell monolayers, and at 72 h.p.t., the supernatants were harvested and serially passaged three times on fresh Huh-7 cells. Infectious rMERS-CoV was recovered with titers of around 10 6 PFU/ml, whereas visible plaques were not detected for rMERS-CoV-⌬E virus throughout these passages (data not shown). Since CPE was observed at passages 0 and 1, the cell supernatants from the different passages were titrated in Huh-7 cells by limiting dilution. In contrast to the wild-type virus, which was recovered with high titers (around 1 ϫ 10 6 50% tissue culture infection dose [TCID 50 ]/ml), the rMERS-CoV-⌬E was detected only at passage 0 with apparent low titers (around 2 ϫ 10 3 TCID 50 /ml) (Fig. 5A ). This apparent low titer was most probably due to the transfer of detached cells transfected with the pBAC-MERS-⌬E. These cells were taken with the supernatant used to infect the next cell monolayer and formed syncytia with the nontransfected cells, giving the impression of virus production. In fact, rMERS-CoV-⌬E virus was lost at subsequent passages in several independent experiments performed in two different cell lines, Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells (data not shown). The presence of viral proteins was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy in Huh-7 cells infected with either rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV-⌬E from passage 0. As expected, E protein was detected in cells infected with rMERS-CoV but not in those infected with rMERS-CoV-⌬E (Fig. 4B ). Viral N protein was detected in the cytoplasm of both rMERS-CoV-and rMERS-CoV-⌬E-infected cells (Fig. 4B) . Interestingly, whereas the N protein was detected all over the cell monolayer in rMERS-CoV-infected cells, it was only detected in small syncytia in cells infected with rMERS-CoV-⌬E. Altogether, these data suggested that E protein was required for efficient virus propagation.
Previous reports from our laboratory showed that deletion of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) E gene leads to a propagation-defective virus that can only spread from cell to cell by expression of the E protein in trans (24, 32) . To analyze whether rMERS-CoV-⌬E could also be complemented in cells transiently expressing E protein, the rescue of rMERS-CoV-⌬E and of rMERS-CoV as a control was analyzed in Huh-7 cells that did not express E protein (E Ϫ ) and in cells transiently expressing the E protein (E ϩ ). The transfection efficiencies in E ϩ cells varied between 40 and 50% in each independent experiment. Infectious rMERS-CoV was rescued from both E ϩ and E Ϫ cells with virus titers of around 4 ϫ 10 5 TCID 50 /ml and 1 ϫ 10 6 TCID 50 /ml, respectively (Fig. 5A ). In contrast, rMERS-CoV-⌬E was rescued in E ϩ cells with titers of around 1 ϫ 10 3 TCID 50 /ml but not in control E Ϫ cells, in which the virus was not detectable from passage 1 (limit of detection, 50 TCID 50 /ml) (Fig. 5A) . These data indicated that the E protein was necessary for either viral RNA synthesis or virus propagation. To evaluate the role of the E protein in viral RNA synthesis, the level of genomic RNA (gRNA) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) at each passage. Viral gRNA was detected for rMERS-CoV in both E Ϫ -and E ϩ -expressing cells, as expected. However, MERS-CoV-⌬E viral RNA was detected at high levels in E ϩ cells at passages 0, 1, 2, and 3, whereas it was only detected at similar levels in E Ϫ cells at passage 0, suggesting that MERS-CoV-⌬E was a replication-competent virus (Fig. 5B) . To further confirm these data, viral RNA synthesis was analyzed in a single-cycle infection. E Ϫ cells were infected with either rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV-⌬E grown in E ϩ cells. At 5 h.p.i., the levels of gRNA and subgenomic mRNA 8 (sgmRNA N) were evaluated by RT-qPCR (Fig. 6 ). Similar levels of gRNA and sgmRNA N were detected in cells infected with both viruses, indicating that E protein was not required for efficient viral replication and transcription. Overall, these data indicated that rMERS-CoV-⌬E was a replicationcompetent, propagation-defective virus.
The emergence of MERS-CoV represents a public health threat that requires further research to understand the virus biology and provide the basis for the development of control strategies. This paper describes for the first time the construction of a reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV, using BACs as vectors. The recombinant viruses described in this work were rescued using a combination of synthetic biology and reverse genetics techniques, as previously described for other CoVs (33). This system constitutes a valuable molecular tool for the rational design and launching of attenuated viruses that may serve as efficient and safe vaccine candidates. In addition, the infectious cDNA clone will be useful to study the role of specific viral genes in virus-host interactions in the context of the complete viral cycle.
A full-length cDNA copy of MERS-CoV-EMC12 was generated from synthetic fragments cloned downstream from the CMV promoter in a BAC. The BAC-based strategy allows the efficient and reproducible intracellular production of viral RNA, since it is first synthesized in the nucleus by the cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and then amplified in the cytoplasm by the viral replicase encoded in the RNA itself (27, 28) . The MERS-CoV infectious cDNA was stably maintained in bacteria for more than 200 generations, allowing the easy and direct manipulation of the viral cDNA for molecular studies. In addition, this BAC-based system allows for the generation of viral replicons that may be used for the screening of drugs affecting viral RNA synthesis (27, 34) .
The full-length sequence of rMERS-CoV, recovered from the infectious cDNA clone, was completely identical to that published for the original MERS-CoV-EMC12 isolate (15) , except for the silent point mutation introduced as a genetic marker. Therefore, both viruses should have the same biological properties. In fact, the growth kinetics and CPE caused by both viruses were similar when the same multiplicity of infection (MOI) was used to infect Huh-7 cells (14) .
Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV sequence seemed more stable in Huh-7 cells than in Vero A66 cells. However, the data presented in this article are statistically very limited to definitively conclude that virus genome stability depends on the cell type used. Based on the preliminary data presented here, it would be interesting to analyze the evolution of the MERS-CoV sequence in different cell types, including human respiratory epithelial cells.
The 3= third of the MERS-CoV genome contains a set of accessory genes encoding proteins with no similarity to other viral or mammalian known proteins (35) . In general, CoV accessory genes are not essential for virus growth in vitro (36) (37) (38) (39) . The reverse genetics system described in this article was used to study the importance of these proteins in cell culture. MERS-CoV genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were each found to be dispensable for virus replication in tissue cultures. Interestingly, some of the rMERS-CoV viruses recovered from Vero A66 cells contained mutations in the accessory gene genome region that would prevent the expression of any of these genes. Similar results were previously reported for the original MERS-CoV-EMC12 isolate after passage in Vero cells (15) . These data suggested an apparent lack of selection pressure on MERS-CoV accessory genes during passages in cell culture and reinforced the dispensability of these genes for virus growth in vitro.
Although not essential in tissue culture, these MERS-CoV accessory genes could have an important role in virus-host interaction in vivo, leading to attenuated phenotypes. CoV accessory genes have been associated with the modulation of viral virulence (40) . Among all CoVs, SARS-CoV contains the largest number of accessory genes, and it has been proposed that these genes may have important contributions to its high virulence (26, 39) . To date, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) ns2 and 5a, TGEV 7, and SARS-CoV 3b and 6 proteins have been implicated in the modulation of innate immune responses, using different mechanisms to influence virus virulence (36, (41) (42) (43) (44) .
rMERS-CoV-⌬E was a replication-competent, propagationdeficient virus and was only efficiently disseminated in cells expressing the E protein in trans. In the presence of transiently ex-pressed E protein, rMERS-CoV-⌬E yielded maximum progeny viral titers of around 10 3 TCID 50 /ml. This modest yield could be improved by the generation of cell lines stably expressing the E protein. In fact, a direct relation between viral titers and the amount of E protein expressed was previously observed for TGEV (45) . However, high expression levels of E protein could induce apoptosis, as described for MHV E protein expression (46) . To overcome this potential adverse effect in the case of MERS-CoV, an inducible system for E protein expression would have to be established.
rMERS-CoV-⌬E did not spread in cells in the absence of E protein, thus constituting a single-cycle replicative virus. However, infected cells produced syncytia, which suggests good expression of viral S protein. In addition, high levels of N protein were observed by immunofluorescence. These data suggested that the high expression levels of viral proteins might serve as potent immunogens to elicit a protective immune response. In the case of SARS-CoV, it has been shown that nonreplicating SARS-CoV-like particles bearing the E, S, and membrane (M) proteins induced immune responses that were protective against SARS in mice (47, 48) . In addition, SARS-CoV inactivated viruses induced adaptive immunity that protected against challenge (49) (50) (51) (52) . The potential of rMERS-CoV-⌬E as a vaccine candidate is reinforced by previous observations indicating that a SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (SARS-CoV-⌬E) is attenuated and induces protection in hamsters, transgenic mice, and conventional aged mice (53) (54) (55) .
MERS-CoV infects mucosal areas in the lungs and, probably, the enteric tract. Mucosal immunity in a specific tissue, such as in lung infections with MERS-CoV, is optimally induced by local stimulation. Therefore, immunization with live attenuated forms of rMERS-CoV-⌬E virus grown in a packaging cell line providing the E protein in trans may be a convenient option, particularly in comparison with purified MERS-CoV antigens, such as the S protein, that could serve as a subunit vaccine.
Vaccines based on live attenuated viruses may present biosafety problems associated with the possibility of reversion to virulent phenotypes or causing disease in immunocompromised individuals. In this sense, the use of rMERS-CoV-⌬E would be a safer option, as it does not propagate in the absence of E protein expression, preventing straightforward reversion to virulence. To increase the biosafety of a rMERS-CoV-⌬E-based vaccine, additional safety guards could be included, such as the previously de-scribed attenuating mutations in distant genomic locations, like those encoding the nsp1 (56, 57) or nsp14 (58) replicase proteins, or by introducing genomic rearrangements (59) . Overall, we consider rMERS-CoV-⌬E a promising vaccine candidate that should be further developed.
rMERS-CoV-⌬E could also be used as the starting point to generate an inactivated vaccine in case of an urgent need to control the disease. In order to guarantee the absence of virulent viruses after an incomplete chemical inactivation due to clump formation, potential noninactivated viruses would be propagation defective and, therefore, attenuated.
rMERS-CoV-⌬E, in which one of the nonessential accessory proteins was deleted, could be considered a marker vaccine, as it will allow the sera of field-infected patients to be distinguished from sera of vaccinated patients, based on the lack of antibodies specific for nonessential viral proteins (60) .
The rMERS-CoV-⌬E could also be considered a viral replicon, as its genome self amplifies in infected cells but infection is not efficiently spread from cell to cell. The construction of a minimal replicon is also possible with reduced effort using the infectious clone, a project that is currently in progress in our laboratory. Therefore, the introduction of a reporter gene, such as green fluorescent protein, within this replicon could easily generate a useful tool for MERS-CoV antiviral drug screening.
In this paper, we describe for the first time a reverse genetics system of MERS-CoV engineered on BACs, which has allowed the generation of the first modified live vaccine candidate to protect against MERS-CoV. Furthermore, this reverse genetics system is a useful tool for the identification of viral genes involved in pathogenesis and the associated signaling pathways. Drugs inhibiting these pathways would be potential antivirals.
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL-10). Human liverderived Huh-7 cells were kindly provided by R. Bartenschlager (University of Heidelberg, Germany). African green monkey kidney-derived Vero A66 cells were kindly provided by A. Carvajal (University of Leon, Spain). In all cases, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (BioWhittaker). Virus titrations were performed on Vero A66 or Huh-7 cells following standard procedures and using closed flasks or plates sealed in plastic bags. For plaque assays, infected cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.6% low-melting agarose and 2% FBS, and at 72 h.p.i., cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. For 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assays, CPE was recorded at 72 h.p.i. All work with infectious virus was performed in biosafety level 3 facilities by personnel wearing positive-pressure air-purifying respirators (highefficiency particulate Air-Mate).
Plasmids and bacteria strains. Plasmid pBeloBAC11 (61), kindly provided by H. Shizuya (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA), was used to assemble the MERS-CoV infectious cDNA clone. This plasmid is a low-copy-number plasmid (one to two copies per cell) based on the E. coli F factor (62) that allows the stable maintenance of large DNA fragments in bacteria. E. coli DH10B (Gibco/BRL) cells were transformed by electroporation using a MicroPulser unit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BAC plasmid and recombinant BACs were isolated and purified using a large-construct kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's specifications.
Construction of a full-length cDNA clone of MERS-CoV. Based on the data of the full-length sequence of the MERS-CoV-EMC12 strain (GenBank accession number JX869059) (15), a MERS-CoV infectious cDNA clone was assembled in BAC using a three-step strategy. In the first step, the restriction sites BamHI (genomic position 806), StuI (genomic positions 7,620 and 9,072), SwaI (genomic position 20,898), and PacI (genomic position 25,836), present in the viral genome, were selected (Fig. 1A) . Second, the intermediate plasmid pBAC-MERS-5=3= was constructed as the backbone for assembly of the full-length cDNA clone (Fig. 1B) . To generate this plasmid, two DNA fragments were generated by chemical synthesis (Bio Basic, Inc.). The first fragment contained the CMV promoter fused to the first 811 nucleotides of the viral genome flanked by SfoI and BamHI sites, and the other one contained a multicloning site with the restriction sites selected in the first step (BamHI, StuI, SwaI, and PacI) followed by the last 4,272 nucleotides of the viral genome joined to a 25-nt poly(A), HDV ribozyme, and BGH termination and polyadenylation sequences. The first DNA fragment was cloned into pBeloBAC11 ϪStuI (a pBeloBAC without the StuI restriction site) and digested with SfoI and BamHI to generate the plasmid pBAC-MERS-5=, and then the plasmid pBAC-MERS-5=3= was generated by cloning the second DNA fragment, digested with BamHI and SfiI, into pBAC-MERS-5= digested with the same restriction enzymes. Finally, the third step was the assembly of the full-length cDNA clone (pBAC-MERS FL ) by sequential cloning of four overlapping DNA fragments (MERS-1 to MERS-4) into the multicloning site of the intermediate plasmid pBAC-MERS-5=3= (Fig. 1C) . The overlapping DNA fragments flanked by the appropriate restriction sites were generated by chemical synthesis (Bio Basic, Inc.). In the case of fragment MERS-3, a silent mutation (T to C) was introduced at position 20,761 in order to eliminate the SwaI restriction site at position 20,760 and to use it as a genetic marker. The genetic integrity of the cloned DNAs was verified throughout the assembly process by extensive restriction analysis and sequencing.
Construction of MERS-CoV cDNA clones lacking accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5. The deletion of gene 3 was generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid pUC-MERS-1 (a pUC plasmid containing the MERS-1 fragment spanning nucleotides 20,898 to 25,836 of the MERS-CoV genome) as the template and the oligonucleotides MERS-S-Tth111I-VS (5= TGCTATTTGACAAAGTCACTATAGCTGATC 3=, where the restriction site Tth111I is underlined) and MERS-S-PacI-RS (5= CCCTTAATTAACTGAGTAACCAACGTCAAAAAGATTCACACT ATTAGTGAACATGAACCTTATGCGGCTCGAGGTCGTATTCC 3=, where the restriction site PacI is underlined). The PCR product, including the deletion (from nucleotides 25,518 to 25,803), was digested with Tth111I and PacI and cloned into the same sites of pUC-MERS-1, leading to pUC-MERS-1-⌬3. To generate pBAC-MERS-⌬3, the SwaI-PacI digestion product from pUC-MERS-1-⌬3 was cloned into the same restriction sites of pBAC-MERS FL (Fig. 3A) .
The deletions of genes 4a, 4b, and 5 were introduced by PCR-directed mutagenesis, using as a template the plasmid pBAC-MERS-3= (a BAC plasmid containing the MERS-3= fragment spanning nucleotides 25,836 to 30,107 of the MERS-CoV genome). For deletion of genes 4a and 4b, overlapping PCR fragments were amplified using oligonucleotides del4ab-VS (5= GAACTCTATGGATTACGGTTGTCTCCATACGGTC 3=) and del4ab-RS (5= GACCGTATGGAGACAACCGTAATCCATAGA GTT 3=). The final PCR product was amplified with outer oligonucleotides T7 and SA27201RS (5= CAAACAGTGGAATGTAGG 3=), digested with PacI and NheI, and cloned into the same restriction sites of pBAC-MERS-3=, leading to pBAC-MERS-3=-⌬4ab that contains a deletion spanning nucleotides 25,862 to 26,751 of the MERS-CoV genome. For gene 5 deletion, a PCR fragment lacking gene 5 (nucleotides 26,835 to 27,513) was amplified using oligonucleotides SA25834VS (5= GTTAATTAACGA ACTCTATGGATTACG 3=, where the restriction site PacI is underlined) and del5-SanDI-RS (5= CACGGGACCCATAGTAGCGCAGAGCTGCT GTTAAAATCCTGGATG 3=, where the restriction site SanDI is underlined), digested with PacI and SanDI, and cloned in the same sites of pBAC-MERS-3=, leading to pBAC-MERS-3=-⌬5. To generate plasmids pBAC-MERS-⌬4ab and pBAC-MERS-⌬5, the PacI-RsrII digestion products from plasmids pBAC-MERS-3=-⌬4ab and pBAC-MERS-3=-⌬5 were cloned in the same sites of pBAC-MERS FL (Fig. 3A) . All cloning steps were checked by sequencing of the PCR fragments and cloning junctions.
Construction of a MERS-CoV cDNA clone lacking the structural E gene. The pBAC-MERS-⌬E, encoding a MERS-CoV lacking the E gene, was constructed from the full-length plasmid pBAC-MERS FL . To this end, the SanDI-RsrII DNA fragment (2,634 bp) from pBAC-MERS FL was exchanged with a chemically synthesized (Bio Basic, Inc.) SanDI-RsrII DNA fragment with a deletion from nucleotides 27,580 to 27,786 that included the TRS core sequence and the first 197 nucleotides of the E gene (Fig. 4A) . The genetic integrity of the cloned DNA was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing.
Recovery of recombinant viruses from the cDNA clones. To recover infectious virus, BHK cells were grown to 95% confluence in a 12.5-cm 2 flask and transfected with 6 g of the infectious cDNA clone using 18 g of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. At 6 h.p.t., cells were trypsinized, plated over a confluent monolayer of either Vero A66 or Huh-7 cells grown in a 12.5-cm 2 flask, and incubated at 37°C for 72 h. The cell supernatants were harvested and passaged once on fresh cells, and the recovered viruses were cloned by three rounds of plaque purification, following standard procedures.
Virus genome sequencing. The complete genome sequence of each rescued recombinant MERS-CoV was determined by sequencing overlapping RT-PCR fragments of 2.5 kb covering the full-length viral genome. Reverse transcription and PCRs were performed with specific oligonucleotides using ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the Expand high-fidelity PCR system (Roche), respectively, following the manufacturers' recommendations. The genomic 5=-and 3=-terminal sequences were determined using the 5=/3= RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Sequence assembly and comparison with the consensus sequence of the MERS-CoV-EMC12 strain were performed with the SeqMan and MegAlign programs (Lasergene, Madison, WI).
For the generation of Huh-7 cells transiently expressing E protein, cells were nucleofected with the plasmid pcDNA3-E (expressing the MERS-CoV E protein under the CMV promoter) by using a 4D Nucleofector device (Lonza) and the buffer and program recommended by the manufacturer. For the construction of plasmid pcDNA3-E, the E gene was amplified by PCR using pBAC-MERS FL as the template and the specific oligonucleotides E1-EcoRI-VS (5= GTGCTGGAATTCGCCGCCATGTTACCCTTT GTCCAAGAACGAA 3=, restriction site EcoRI is underlined) and E249-XhoI-RS (5= CGCCCAGCTCGAGTTAAACCCACTCGTCAGGTGG 3=, restriction site XhoI is underlined) and cloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) digested with EcoRI and XhoI.
Analysis of viral RNA synthesis by RT-qPCR. Total intracellular RNA was extracted from transfected or infected cells with the RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. In the case of transfected cells, the residual DNA was removed from samples by treating 7 g of each RNA with 20 U of DNase I (Roche) in 100 l for 30 min at 37°C, and DNA-free RNAs were repurified using the RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen). Viral RNA synthesis was quantified by RT-qPCR. Total cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers from 100 ng of total RNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). Using this cDNA, the viral RNA synthesis was analyzed using two custom TaqMan assays specific for MERS-CoV gRNA (forward primer 5= GCACATCTGT GGTTCTC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were acquired with an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system and analyzed with ABI PRISM 7500 software, version 2.0.5. The relative quantifications were performed using the cycle threshold (2 Ϫ⌬⌬CT ) method (63) . To normalize for differences in RNA sampling, the expression of eukaryotic 18S rRNA was analyzed using a specific TaqMan gene expression assay (Hs99999901_s1; Applied Biosystems).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generation of polyclonal antisera specific for MERS-CoV N and E proteins. Rabbit polyclonal antisera (pAb) specific for MERS-CoV N and E proteins were purchased from BioGenes. In brief, peptides NTGRS-VYVKFQDSKPPL (corresponding to E protein amino acids 60 to 76) and AAAKNKMRHKRTST (N protein amino acids 244 to 257) were synthesized and used to immunize two rabbits with each peptide according to the company's standard protocol. The polyclonal antisera obtained were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the synthetic peptides, leading to titers ranging from 1:150,000 to 1:200,000 in all cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Indirect immunofluorescence assay. Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells were grown to 80% confluence on glass coverslips and infected with the recombinant MERS-CoVs. At 48 h.p.i., cells were fixed either with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 20 min or with methanol at Ϫ20°C for 15 min. For N protein immunodetection, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% saponin in PBS containing 10% FBS for 20 min and incubated with MERS-CoV N protein pAb (dilution 1:200) in PBS containing 10% FBS at room temperature for 90 min. For E protein immunodetection, methanol-fixed cells were incubated with MERS-CoV E protein pAb (dilution 1:500) in PBS containing 10% FBS overnight at 4°C. Coverslips were washed 4 times with PBS and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 10% FBS. Nuclei were stained using DAPI (4=,6=-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1:200, Sigma). To fully inactivate the samples' infectivity, methanol-fixed cells were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS as described above. Finally," coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Images were acquired with the same instrument settings and analyzed with Leica software.""","Engineering a Replication-Competent, Propagation-Defective Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus as a Vaccine Candidate","Almazán, Fernando; DeDiego, Marta L.; Sola, Isabel; Zuñiga, Sonia; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Marquez-Jurado, Silvia; Andrés, German; Enjuanes, Luis",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774192/,331,5411,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
157,541efff1146fcb123189ad615099b67769ed41c5,"Background: Human consumption of bats poses an increasing public health threat globally. Communities in which bat guano is mined from caves have extensive exposure to bat excreta, often harvest bats for consumption, and are at risk for bat-borne diseases.
Methods: This rapid ethnographic study was conducted in four provinces of Thailand (Ratchaburi, Sakaeo, Nakorn Sawan, and Phitsanulok), where bat guano was mined and sold during the period AprilÁAugust 2014. The aim of this study was to understand behaviors and risk perceptions associated with bat conservation, exposure to bats and their excreta, and bat consumption. Sixty-seven respondents playing various roles in bat guano mining, packaging, sale, and use as fertilizer participated in the study. Data were collected through interviews and/or focus group discussions. Results: In spite of a bat conservation program dating back to the 1980s, the benefits of conserving bats and the risks associated with bat consumption were not clear and infrequently articulated by study respondents. Discussion: Since bat consumption continues, albeit covertly, the risk of bat-borne diseases remains high. There is an opportunity to reduce the risk of bat-borne diseases in guano-mining communities by strengthening bat conservation efforts and raising awareness of the health risks of bat consumption. Further research is suggested to test behavior change strategies for reducing bat consumption.","Z oonotic pathogens cause an estimated 70% of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in humans (1Á3). Bats in particular are important wild animal reservoirs for zoonotic viruses, as they host more viruses per species than other mammals (4) . Several emerging diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (5) , Ebola virus (6, 7) , Nipah virus (8) , and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) (9) , have been linked to bats. There is nevertheless little research on bat and human interaction, the human perceptions about bats and the associated disease risk, and the populations that are the most at risk (10) .
Globally, there are two main types of bats: megabats (Megachiroptera) and microbats (Microchiroptera). Megabats are found in the subtropics and tropics of Asia and Africa, and feed on nectar and pollen, petals, bracts, fruit, leaves, and water (11) . In Thailand, where the study was undertaken, there are several species of flying foxes and fruit bats. Microbats are geographically more widespread than the megabats. They are sometimes referred to as insectivorous bats because insects are their primary food. Bats are hunted, eaten, and used for medicine and natural insect control. Their excrement (guano) is used as fertilizer (10, 12Á14) .
Bat guano mining is common globally, especially in countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean and East Asian countries (including Thailand). Guano mining can be very lucrative: the guano produced by a large cavedwelling population of bats might be worth several million dollars each year (13, 15) . Bat guano is a very rich fertilizer, primarily due to its high nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus content (16) . In Thailand, guano produced by the microbat Tadarida plicata, the wrinkle-lipped freetailed bat, is favored for its rich organic content. It is the most abundant bat in Thailand, lives in 17 caves across the country, and is insectivorous (12) . Exposure to bats, bat guano, and bat excreta through bat consumption puts people at risk of direct contact with bat-borne viruses (14, 17) .
Because of the potential for human contact with infected bats, the PREVENT Project, a part of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) Program, decided to conduct this exploratory, rapid ethnographic study. of the study was to understand the various ways by which people are exposed to bats and bat excreta in the context of guano mining, and its packaging and sale as fertilizer in Thailand; the perceived health risks associated with such exposure; and the measures that may be used to mitigate risk among people involved in the guano-mining business. This paper focuses on bat consumption only indirectly, given the current legal prohibitions against capturing and selling bats.
The study was conducted in four sites in Thailand where bat guano is mined and sold. The sites, located in four provinces (Ratchaburi, Sakaeo, Nakorn Sawan, and Phitsanulok), were selected to represent several different ways in which bat guano mining is organized and regulated.
Observing the different ways guano mining is handled was intended to capture possible variations in the age groups and numbers of people who are exposed to bats and bat excreta, the extent of their exposure, and the measures that are taken to reduce exposure. Preference was given to sites where other USAID EPT Program activities were taking place, especially other studies bat-borne and other zoonotic viruses. A map of the selected provinces is shown in Fig. 1 .
A rapid ethnography approach was utilized to understand perceptions and behaviors regarding exposure to bats and bat excreta. Although the research conducted examined different aspects of exposure to bat and bat excreta, this paper reports only our findings on bat consumption. The research was implemented from April to August 2014.
Six types of respondents (aged 20 years and above) were included in the study, for a total 67 interviews:
1. Mine managers. The mine manager is the person who runs day-to-day operations at the guano mine. There were only one or two managers at the selected sites. The willingness of the mine manager(s) to be interviewed was one of our criteria for site selection. 2. Male and female miners. The selection of the miners was purported to capture the range of different ages, gender, and other characteristics noted by the mine managers. The eligible miners were required to have been engaged in the guano-mining work for a minimum of 6 months. The researchers approached the miners at the cave where they worked; obtained their preliminary consent, home addresses, and phone numbers; and made appointments to interview them at a convenient time at their homes or another location of their choice. 3. Adults who dry, package, and/or purchase the guano at the mine site. We included respondents who were willing to respond to questions and also lived near the mines. 4. Spouses or other adult family members of miners who wash miners' soiled clothing or otherwise come into direct or indirect contact with bats or their excreta. These respondents were referred by the miners. 5. Owners or managers of shops that sell guano. These respondents were referred by the guano buyers at the mine. They were interviewed in their shops or another location of their choice. 6. Users of guano for fertilizer. These respondents were referred either by shopkeepers, miners, or miners' spouses. Preference was given to users residing in the communities of the miners. They were interviewed in their homes or another location of their choice. Numbers of respondents' by province and type are shown in Table 1 .
The five interviewers (two male and three female) used semi-structured interview guides to conduct one-onone, open-ended interviews in Thai with each type of respondent. The interviewers were trained to probe and spontaneously add questions based on the discussion and information provided by the respondents. A note-taker accompanied each interviewer to record observations related to body language, the presence of other individuals during the interview, and details of the environment in which the interview took place. Written informed consent was obtained prior to each interview. The interviews were audio-recorded with permission from the respondents.
In two sites, we conducted focus group discussions, inviting all respondents (except mine managers), who wished to join. In these discussions, we summarized what we learned from the individual interviews about exposure to bats and bat excreta and asked for verification and corrections, discussed risk mitigation strategies and barriers to their use, and elicited opinions about the feasibility and acceptability of potential strategies to minimize exposure to guano, such as wearing goggles and masks.
The interviews were transcribed and translated into English. The English translations were thematically coded using the qualitative research software, NVivo 10. Data on specific topics of interest were systematically compared across interviews and variations by gender and site noted. 
Guano miners have an appreciation and respect for bats that live in their communities or are seen existing community caves or fruit orchards. In recent years, it has become illegal to trap or eat bats. In spite of this, most respondents knew people in the community who had trapped bats, usually at the mouths of caves or in fruit orchards, and/or had eaten bats, although they said this was less common since the regulations went into effect. It is legal for community members to collect and eat the occasional bat that falls to the ground after colliding with electric power lines.
Respondents who either had eaten bats or knew people who had eaten bats said that they were usually prepared by frying or stir-frying with garlic, chili and/or basil; or boiling in curry after discarding the intestines and wings. Some people also ferment bat meat as they would pork, and serve it with rice; or prepare a spicy bat soup. In addition to cooking bats, the practice of drinking bat blood (e.g. as a health supplement or a few drops mixed with whiskey) was reported as a rumor in three of the four sites.
Below is information on the consumption of bats from respondents in each province (identified as A, B, C, and D to protect confidentiality).
Historically, until about 10 years ago, bats were caught in nets at the top of the mountain at the cave mouth and sold in batches of up to 100 at the food stall. Since the arrival of the governmental wildlife conservation office, however, this practice has all but stopped. The Royal Forest Department prohibits trapping bats for consumption and levies a fine of 500 Baht on those who trap or This respondent was the same person (the mine manager and owner of the shop); b in practice, the categories of miners and spouses were not mutually exclusive. During interviews with spouses, we learned that both husbands and wives often work in guano mines. In these cases, we interviewed the spouses both as miners and as spouses of miners, but classified them as spouses in the table above to avoid double-counting.
Citation: Infection Ecology and Epidemiology 2016, 6: 29941http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/iee.v6.29941 eat bats. As in the other provinces, bats are sometimes trapped, and eaten or sold secretly. The bats that are eaten in the community are the flying fox and lotus bats, which tend to be comparatively large, fatty bats. It was also noted that Lesser Dog-faced Fruit Bat (Khang Kao Na Ma) and the Shortridge's Rousette bat (Khang Kao Bua) were occasionally consumed in the community. Some of the illegally trapped bats are sold to restaurants for 4Á5 Baht per bat. The restaurants sell bats as a gourmet item that is likely not found on the published restaurant menu. Bat blood is used as a health supplement in the province. Fresh bat blood mixed with alcohol is sometimes used to relieve back, leg, and waist pain or to nourish the body and prevent 'wasting disease'. Bat blood can be purchased in the community for 5Á10 Baht per bottle.
The Royal Forest Department did not seem to be active in this province at the time of the study. The villagers were knowledgeable about the need to conserve bats, and there did not appear to be a fine for catching or consuming bats in this community. In the past, people in this community ate the large Lye's flying fox bats that were brought home by the miners. Reportedly, restaurants still place private orders for bats with a few people who occasionally set up nets at the mouth of the cave to catch them. The bats are purchased for 1 Baht per bat.
At the time of the study, there was a 500-Baht fine for trapping and/or eating bats in this province. Bats that died a natural death could be consumed with no fine. Mid-sized bats are illegally trapped and sold in the community. Nonspecific cave bats, bats caught in nets at the mango or red cotton flower fields, and the flying fox bat were among the bat types secretly caught as an illegal food source. In addition to bat meat, respondents reported that bat blood is occasionally consumed as a health supplement in the community, as it is said to be useful for treating asthma in children (especially if the blood is taken from a bat's ear or wing), curing other unnamed illnesses, or increasing strength.
Province D Although trapping and consuming bats has been regulated for some time in this province with a fine that is rumored to be very high (50,000Á60,000 Baht), numerous respondents spoke of their knowledge or experience in trapping and consuming bats. The most common bats consumed are fruit bats that become caught in nets placed over fruit trees or sugar palms. Small bats are also occasionally eaten. Bats that fall from after flying into power lines can be legally consumed and are often made into a spicy bat soup or stir fry. Bat blood is occasionally consumed and is considered to be an aphrodisiac.
Efforts to protect bat populations in Thailand's caves began in the 1980s and have continued until the present time. Recent legislation makes it illegal to trap or eat bats in Thailand. Currently, the Royal Forest Department discourages the trapping and eating of bats by levying steep fines. The fines were noted in all of the communities we studied. The benefits of conserving bats and the risks associated with bat consumption, however, were infrequently articulated by the study respondents, indicating that illegality was the greatest deterrent to trapping and eating bats, not concerns about animal conservation or health risk reasons. However, several studies presented relevant evidences that bat consumption might be risky for bat-borne diseases (10, 14, 17) . Aside from direct consumption, the transmission of disease from bats to people in Bangladesh is through the contamination of raw date palm sap by bats. Presumably, the transmission to humans occurs through the consumption of food contaminated with bat saliva or urine, and the infection of domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and goats) (18) .
Further community-level research should be conducted on the perceived economic and other benefits related to bat catching and consumption, as well as community knowledge and perceptions of the risks associated with bats. Findings from this research may illuminate barriers to bat conservation and lead to the development of strategies and interventions for eliminating bat consumption. This has the potential to mitigate the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases from bats to humans in Thailand, as well as in other countries where bats are eaten.

ULDCT was performed prospectively in 207 febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancy. Three observers independently recorded the presence of lung parenchymal abnormality, and also indicated the cause of the lung parenchymal abnormality between infectious and noninfectious causes. If infectious pneumonia was considered the cause of lung abnormalities, they noted the two most appropriate diagnoses among four infectious conditions, including fungal, bacterial, viral, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. Sensitivity for correct diagnoses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for evaluation of diagnostic accuracy were calculated. Interobserver agreements were determined using intraclass correlation coefficient.
Of 207 patients, 139 (67%) had pneumonia, 12 had noninfectious lung disease, and 56 had no remarkable chest computed tomography (CT) (20 with extrathoracic fever focus and 36 with no specific disease). Mean radiation expose dose of ULDCT was 0.60±0.15 mSv. Each observer regarded low-dose CT scans as unacceptable in only four (1.9%), one (0.5%), and three (1.5%) cases of ULDCTs. Sensitivity and area under the ROC curve in making a specific pneumonia diagnosis were 63.0%, 0.65 for reader 1; 63.0%, 0.61 for reader 2; and 65.0%, 0.62 for reader 3; respectively. Conclusion ULDCT, with a sub-mSv radiation dose and acceptable image quality, provides ready and reasonably acceptable diagnostic information for pulmonary infection in febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy.","Immunocompromised patients with underlying hematologic malignancy are at increased risk of potentially fatal infection as a consequence of treatment-associated neutropenia [1] . The lungs are the most frequently involved organ for such infection [2] . According to a recent guideline established by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), chest radiograph is recommended for patients with respiratory signs and symptoms in order to rule out the presence of pneumonia [3] . The problem is that a chest radiograph frequently cannot depict the presence of lung abnormality at the early stage of pneumonia. Heussel et al. [4] demonstrated the presence of inflammatory pulmonary disease on computed tomography (CT) in more than 50% of febrile neutropenic patients who had normal chest radiographs. Hence, in daily practice, chest CT studies are recommended in patients with a risk for complicated pulmonary infection [5] ; consequently, the rates of chest CT + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + use have increased in febrile neutropenic patients [6] .
On the other hand, although the immediate benefit to the individual patient can be substantial, the relatively high radiation doses associated with CT as compared with conventional radiography have raised health concerns [7] . A recent retrospective cohort study [8] showed an increase in leukemia and brain cancer rates in children who underwent multiple CT scans at ages younger than 15 years. In addition, thyroid glands, breast, and lungs are among the most cancer-susceptible organs in the body, and those organs are all included in chest CT. Therefore, although diagnostic information on lung abnormalities is needed in febrile neutropenic patients, CT radiation dose should be reduced as much as reasonably achievable [9] .
An emerging method of reducing radiation exposure to populations requiring repeated imaging is the development of low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols [10] [11] [12] . Conversely, there has been concern over LDCT technique because the technique may cause increased image noise and thus degrade image quality. With recent rapid advancement of CT technology, however, tolerable-quality CT scans have been readily available via excessively small quantity of radiation exposure with an effective dose of less than one mSv (sub-mSv level, expressed as ultra-low-dose CT [ULDCT]) [13] .
Currently, we are not precisely aware of the practical feasibility and usefulness of ULDCT for evaluation of patients with neutropenic fever. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the imaging quality of ULDCT and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ULDCT technique in making a specific diagnosis in patients with hematologic malignancy and neutropenic fever.
This prospective study, conducted in a single-site, tertiary-care, and oncology center, was approved by our institutional review board (approval no. 2012-05-044), and written informed consent for the use of CT scan was obtained from all patients. Between July 2008 and March 2011, ULDCT studies were performed prospectively in all febrile neutropenic patients with a history of hematological malignancy. Clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever was based on fulfillment of body temperature higher than 38 Celsius with absolute neutrophil count lower than 500. ULDCT was performed 2-3 days after development of neutropenic fever. Regardless of the suspicion of pneumonia, ULDCT was performed 2-3 days after development of neutropenic fever. According to the protocol of our hospital for care of hematologic malignancy patients since August 2006, if neutropenic fever is prolonged for two to three days, routine examination by ULDCT is performed in all patients because chest X-ray frequently fails to depict the presence of lung abnormality at the early stage of pneumonia.
ULDCT scans were performed using a 16-detector row (LightSpeed16, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) scanner. Unenhanced CT images were obtained with the following parameters: detector collimation, 0.625 mm; field of view, 34.5 cm; beam pitch, 1.35 or 1.375; gantry speed, 0.6 second CT, computed tomography; GGO, ground-glass opacity. a) Although Pneumocystis jiroveci organism now belongs to the species fungus, this was separated with its specific CT findings. 
CT images were assessed independently by three thoracic radiologists (K.S.L., J.W.M., K.E.S.; 30-, five-, and five-year experience in thoracic radiology, respectively) in a random order. They knew only that the patients had been referred for evaluation of neutropenic fever, and were unaware of all other clinical information. Before interpretation, an initial orientation session was held for all observers to review and become familiar with the descriptions of previously published data using articles containing other cases not included in the current study (Table 1 ) [4, [14] [15] [16] .
All ULDCT images were initially evaluated for their quality, based on soft-tissue contrast, the sharpness of tissue interfaces, and the conspicuity of focal abnormalities. The image quality was graded as excellent when images were comparable to those of standard-dose CT obtained for daily practice; acceptable when they were satisfactory for diagnostic evaluation; and unacceptable when they were unsatisfactory and additional imaging is needed for making an imaging diagnosis ( Fig. 1 ).
Next, for each set of images, each observer recorded the presence or absence of lung parenchymal abnormality, and when abnormality was present, the observer also indicated the cause of the lung parenchymal abnormalities including infectious and noninfectious causes. If infectious pneumonia was considered the cause of lung abnormalities, they recorded the two most appropriate diagnoses among four infectious conditions, including fungal, bacterial, viral, and Pneumocystis pneumonia, and also recorded the confidence ratings for each diagnosis, ranging from 1% to 100%. The percentages given were used for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for differential diagnosis of infectious pneumonia (Fig. 2 ).
According to a recent guideline established by the IDSA, all patients underwent chest X-rays. In addition, we reviewed the chest X-rays obtained before ULDCT in patients in whom abnormal findings were detected on ULDCT in order to determine the detection rate of chest X-rays and mortality of included patients because the purpose of ULDCT should be to reduce the incidence of respiratory failure and death.
If pneumonia was suspected on ULDCT, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. To rule out other causes, either infection or not, we performed BAL for all included patients. BAL fluid analysis, including neutrophil or lymphocyte A C D dominant, T cell subtype, and color of BAL fluid are important factors for differential diagnosis among infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, or drug reaction. Final diagnosis was made in each case by reviewing each patient's medical record and laboratory findings, including the following two weeks chest radiographs. An internal medicine physician (S.Y.P.) who subspecialized in respiratory medicine for eight years made an integrative confirmative diagnosis taking into account all clinical symptoms, laboratory test results, and response to treatments after discussion with more than three physicians, including an intensivist, pulmonologist, oncologist, intensive care unit fellow, and the physician in charge. If the decision was not concordant, we requested consultantation to the division of infectious disease. We validated precise diagnosis through serial follow up of chest X-ray, inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, and clinical symptoms of patients. Evidence of pneumonia on follow-up chest images and microorganisms detected during follow-up microbiologic studies were also regarded as documentation of pneumonia.
After the diagnoses were made, patients were categorized according to four groups based on having infectious pneumonia, noninfectious pulmonary disease, extrathoracic fever focus, and no remarkable chest CT without any specific lung fever focus. These categories kept completely grounded on clinical and microbiological diagnosis. First, the diagnosis of infectious pneumonia was made with the following clinical imaging and microbiological study results: a combination of lung lesions seen on ULDCT which were presumed to be possible for infectious focus, respiratory symptoms, specific pathogens identified from peripheral blood or BAL fluid analysis, or good response to antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral treatments. The infectious pneumonia group was subdivided into four categories according to pathogens identified: bacterial, viral, fungal, and Pneumocystis jiroveci organisms. For example, in the case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia, we checked CMV antigemia and treatment response. Second, diagnosis of noninfectious pneumonia was made on lung parenchymal lesions, which were deemed to be less responsible for infectious focus. In addition, the patients in this category did not show any response to antibiotic or antifungal treatment. Patients who had no abnormal lesions on ULDCT, no evidence of extrathoracic fever focus, no response to antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral treatments, and no new lesion on follow-up chest radiographs taken during two weeks after fever onset were categorized as having normal chest finding. Extrathoracic fever focus was elucidated by making a diagnosis of extrathoracic fever focus by disclosing definite evidence, such as catheter related infection, pseudomembranous colitis, or urinary tract infection.
Interobserver agreements for imaging quality and differential diagnosis of ULDCT were estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). ICC results were interpreted as follows: 0-0.2 indicates poor agreement; 0.3-0.4 indicates fair agreement; 0.5-0.6 indicates moderate agreement; 0.7-0.8 indicates strong agreement; and > 0.8 indicates almost perfect agreement. Sensitivities for the presence of lung abnormality on CT and correct diagnoses for infectious versus noninfectious causes were calculated using the standard definition. Sensitivity for differential diagnoses of infectious pneumonias was calculated based on per-patient which was a confirmed pathogen. In terms of assessment of mixed infection (more than one organism identified), the diagnosis was considered correct when two organisms recorded corresponded with any of one or two microbiologic organisms consequently identified. ROC analysis from recorded likelihood (percentages rendered for each diagnosis) for differential diagnosis of infectious pneumonia was also used for evaluation of diagnostic accuracy for infectious pneumonia. All analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics (ver. 19.0, IBM Co., Armonk, NY).
The final study included 207 patients, and the clinical underlying diseases are summarized in Table 2 . Of the 207 patients, 139 patients (67%) eventually proved to have infection, 12 patients (6%) had noninfectious causes, 36 patients (17%) had no remarkable chest CT, and the remaining 20 patients (10%) had extrathoracic infectious focus. Of 139 patients with infectious pneumonia, more than two pathogens were identified in 11 patients (8%). Therefore, a total of 150 pathogens were identified (139+11 pathogens). Bacterial, fungal, viral, and Pneumocystis jiroveci organisms accounted for 48 (35%), 55 (40%), 42 (30%), and four (2.9%) of 150 pathogens, respectively. In 12 patients with noninfectious cause for lung abnormalities, final diagnoses were reached by biopsy (graft-versus-host disease, relapsing leukemia, and all-trans-retinoic acid syndrome), observing the clinical course (overhydration in four patients, drug toxicity in two patients improved after drug off), and BAL (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in three patients). In 36 patients with no remarkable chest CT, the absence of lung abnormality was confirmed by the absence of lung lesions on both clinico-laboratory data and follow-up chest radiographs for two weeks after the no remarkable chest CT.
Final diagnoses in 20 patients of the extrathoracic fever focus group were eight urinary tract infections, ten catheter-related infections, and two pseudomembranous colitis.
Median body mass index (BMI) was 22 kg/m 2 , which belonged to the normal weight category (18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ). Out of 207 patients, 29 patients (14%) fell into the overweight category (25-29.9 kg/m 2 ). Body weight and BMI of each patient were within average range. Most patients were very cachexic due to underlying malignancy, so that there was no evidence that it had any effect on the image quality.
Mean radiation exposure dose of ULDCT was 0.60±0.15 mSv, and was approximately one twelfth of the effective dose of conventional chest CT (7.0 mSv) [17] . Image quality assessment and interobserver agreement by three observers are shown in Table 3 . Unacceptable image quality was rendered in only four (1.9%), one (0.5%), and three (1.5%) ULDCTs; other scans were regarded as excellent or acceptable quality.
The presence or absence of lung abnormality was correctly determined in 183 of 207 patients (88.4%), 169 (81.6%), and 189 (91.3%), respectively, by three observers, and interobserver agreement for the presence of lung abnormality was 0.85. When counting the first diagnosis recorded (infectious versus noninfectious), overall correct diagnoses including infectious and noninfectious causes for lung abnormalities were made in 105 of 151 patients (69.5%) with lung abnormality, 104 (68.9%), and 108 (71.5%), respectively, by three observers.
Sensitivity and area under the ROC curve for correct diagnosis of infectious pneumonia were 63% (95 of 150 pathogens) with 0.65 for reader 1; 63%, 0.61 (91 of 150) for reader 2; and 65%, 0.62 (93 of 150) for reader 3; respectively ( Table 4 ). The mean percentages of correct diagnoses made by at least two of three radiologists were all more than 60% for four categories. Three radiologists reached unanimous agreement on the correct diagnosis for infectious pneumonia (as for organisms) in 65 cases (47%).
Compared with ULDCT, among the 151 patients (139 patients of infectious cause and 12 patients of noninfectious case) in whom lung abnormality was detected on ULDCT, the detection rate of lung parenchymal opacity through chest X-ray was only 38.5% (58 patients), which is much lower than that for ULDCT. Of these, the mortality rate in patients with infectious pneumonia who died within one month was 5% (7/139 patients).

Pneumonias represent the most unfavorable infectious complications occurring during the course of neutropenia in patients with cancer. The incidence of pneumonia in high-risk patients (e.g., patients with acute leukemias) is 17% [2] to 24% [18] , and their clinical response to broad spectrum antibiotic therapy-eventually supplemented by antifungal treatment active against Aspergillus species-is 60% to 65%, whereas the infection-related fatality rate in these patients may be as high as 38% [18] . Thus, lung infections are associated with significant prognostic deterioration in patients with cancer [19] . However, efforts to identify the etiology of pneumonia in febrile neutropenic patients by use of invasive techniques have not clearly improved. The diagnostic yield of conventional chest radiography is poor [20, 21] and the diagnostic yield of BAL fluid procedures is controversially debated [21] .
Although recent various nonculture based sensitive tests for pathogen identification, such as serum galactomannan test [22] or CMV antigen titer test, enable increased diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary infection, these tests have poorer sensitivity in non-neutropenic patients and in patients receiving mold-active prophylaxis. In addition, false-positive results due to cross reactivity during administration of piperacillin-tazobactam, which is used in many hematology units as the front-line anti-Pseudomonas antibiotics for febrile CT, computed tomography; CI, confidence interval; ROC, receiver operating characteristic. a) Cases of correct diagnoses reached by two or more observers, regardless of the degree of confidence, b) Intraclass correlation coefficient, c) 139 patients had infectious cause, and more than two pathogens were identified in 11 patients.

neutropenia, can also be a problem [3, 6] . Therefore, many patients with neutropenic fever and normal chest radiographic findings may undergo chest CT to determine whether or not lung parenchyma abnormalities are present, and for consideration of a particular pathogen, even though the radiologic manifestations of pneumonia are not specific enough to make a differential diagnosis of infection from other causes of lung abnormality. Meanwhile, prognosis is significantly influenced by early identification of lung infiltrates by means of chest CT, because it leads to earlier commencement of therapy and enables selection of better-tolerated, effective, and safe treatment options [16] . Above all, pneumonia in general appears initially as subtle lesions which are not detectable on chest radiograph, and in some patients with neutropenia or immunocompromised state, the pneumonia shows rapid progression. Therefore, prognosis of febrile neutropenic patients is determined by early identification of the underlying microorganisms and the timely start of specific antimicrobial drug therapy. In addition, chest CT may be used to monitor patient response to therapy [14] . Repeated CT scans at short-term intervals may be necessary when pneumonia during a neutropenic period may progress rapidly to respiratory failure.
In our study, ULDCT showed good image quality with almost perfect agreement and highly acceptable performance for the diagnosis of pulmonary infection. Results of our study suggest that ULDCT enables as high diagnostic sensitivity for pulmonary infection in patients with neutropenic fever as CT of standard dose [16] . In addition, we identified definite superiority in detection of ULDCT compared with chest X-ray.
Body weight and BMI might affect the CT image [23] . However, in our study, the body weight and BMI of each patient were within average range, and were not a concern.
According to Heussel et al. [24] , in 70 (48%) of 146 cases, findings on chest radiographs were normal, whereas findings on thin-section CT scans were suggestive of pneumonia. More importantly, the probability of development of pneumonia was less than 15% among those with negative CT results. CT information showing that lungs are probably not involved with inflammatory/infectious disease can be very important for the referring hematologist, because reasons for fever and its relation to pulmonary infection should be readily clarified.
We designed this study prospectively in order to investigate the diagnostic value of ULDCT in clinical practice. And, in more than 60% of patients, infectious pathogens could be predicted, thus demonstrating clinical relevance of performing ULDCT in patients with fever and hematologic malignancy. Therefore, ULDCT could perhaps be considered as a study of choice in the context of assessing pulmonary infection in febrile neutropenic patients, because this technique allowed a reduction of radiation dose by up to 91%. Similarly, Patsios et al. [11] compared LDCT with chest radiography in assessment of febrile hematologic malignancy patients. Overall, 31 of 40 chest radiographs (77.5%) were abnormal, whereas LDCT was helpful in detection of lung abnormalities in 38 patients (95.0%), and the additional information provided by LDCT led to an alteration in the clinical management methods in 11 of 40 patients (27.5%).
A large well-designed epidemiologic study has clearly shown that the individual risks of radiation exposure in diagnostic imaging are small but real [8] . Therefore, it seems to be no longer tenable to claim that CT risks are ""too low to be detectable and may be non-existent"" [3] . Given the current level of scientific uncertainty regarding radiation risk at low-dose level, it may be appropriate to act on the assumption that such risks are real, as this conservative approach is unlikely to underestimate patient risks [21] . Our study has demonstrated a significant reduction of effective radiation dose without abandonment of the image quality. ULDCT contributed to the appropriate treatment for neutropenic patients, at a relatively early stage. By using ULDCT, we might expect a better survival rate in febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy.
The current study has several limitations. First, invasive diagnostic procedures for histopathologic or microbiologic confirmation were not performed in all patients. However, even with surgical lung biopsy the definite diagnosis could not be made in a certain percentage of patients in whom identifiable abnormalities were observed on CT or chest radiography. Also in our study, diagnoses for lung abnormalities were made by integrating clinical, laboratory, imaging, microbiologic, or histopathologic findings. Second, because this study was conducted prospectively before the clinical use of state-of-the-art dose reduction techniques such as adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) or model-based iterative reconstruction [25] , such new techniques could not be applied in our study. If these techniques could have been applied, the lowest thus more mitigated radiation-dose CT images might have been produced and used for image interpretation. However, there has still been debate regarding the image quality of ASIRapplied image, particularly for interstitial lung lesions or ground-glass opacities due to spatial resolution and edge sharpness [23] . In addition, we did not obtain the standard dose CT simultaneously for direct comparison with image quality because our concern was the precise impact on clinical decision. The other reason was the ethical concern of increased radiation exposure by double scanning. We also worried about a higher radiation exposure dose of ULDCT compared with chest X-ray. We did the best we could to References reduce the radiation dose even approximately one twelfth of the effective dose of conventional chest CT (7.0 mSv). And, we thought that reduction of mortality due to early detection of fever focus is more important than radiation hazard.
In conclusion, ULDCT, with a very low level of patient radiation dose, provides acceptable image quality and provides ready and reasonably acceptable diagnostic information for lung abnormalities, particularly for diagnosis of pulmonary infection in febrile neutropenic and hematologic-malignancy patients.

The etiological pathogens and prognostic factors of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infections were prospectively investigated. Methods: Enrolled children fulfilled the following criteria: (1) PICU admission; (2) age of 1 month to 16 years; (3) diagnosis of infectious pneumonia and respiratory virus infection; and (4) development of severe ARDS within 72 h after PICU admission. Pathogens were detected in the blood and tracheal lavage fluid using molecular techniques and a conventional culture system. The serum levels of inflammatory mediators on the day of PICU admission were examined. Results: Fifty-seven patients (32 boys; median age, 9 months) were enrolled. Multiple virus infections, co-infection with bacteria/fungus, and bacteremia/fungemia were observed in 60%, 49%, and 32% of children, respectively. Adenovirus-B, measles virus, and cytomegalovirus were detected predominantly in tracheal lavage fluid. There were no statistically significant differences between non-survivors and survivors regarding the types of pathogen, incidence of multiple virus infection, gender, age, clinical features, and treatment. The serum levels of interferon (IFN)-γ and the IFN-γ/interleukin (IL)-10 ratio were higher in non-survivors. Conclusions: IFN-γ upregulation as detected on the day of PICU admission was found to be one of the possible prognostic factors affecting a fatal outcome. These results suggest that modulation of inflammatory responses is critical for the clinical management of children with ARDS.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous syndrome with a severe lung inflammation disorder that presents as rapidly progressive hypoxemia and dyspnea. 1 ARDS is principally associated with direct injury to the lung, such as infectious pneumonia, or indirect injury to the lung resulting from systemic inflammation, such as non-pulmonary sepsis, trauma, and surgery. 2 Pneumonia remains the predominant cause of death in children under 5 years of age 3 and it is the most common trigger of ARDS in children. 4 Pediatric ARDS is one of the most lethal diseases in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and is associated with a high rate of mortality. 5 Historically, pediatric ARDS was defined using the adult ARDS criteria based on the American-European Consensus Conference 6 and Berlin Definition in 2012 7 before the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference published a pediatric-specific definition of ARDS in 2015. 8 According to the Berlin Definition, severe ARDS is defined as hypoxemia with ≤100 mm Hg of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 mm Hg) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) ratio (P/F ratio) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
We previously reported that children with H5N1 avian influenza virus (H5N1) infection developed severe ARDS and showed that H5N1 directly infected and injured alveolar epithelial cells, which was correlated with the expression levels of cytokine/ chemokine-mRNAs in lung tissues by pathological and molecular biological examinations of post-mortem biopsied H5N1 infected lung tissues. 9, 10 Other emerging viruses such as H7N9 avian influenza virus (H7N9), 11 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV), 12 [16] [17] [18] Several inflammatory mediators were reported to be biomarkers of ARDS and potential predictors of poor outcome. 19 However, few studies have examined the inflammatory response, specifically in severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infections.
The primary aim of this study was to examine the pathogens contributing to severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children. The secondary aim was to examine the profiles of inflammatory mediators and investigate the prognostic factors for a fatal outcome of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children using multivariate analysis. (HMGB-1) were measured using the HMGB1 ELISA kit II (Shino-test Corp., Tokyo, Japan). HMGB-1 is a late inflammatory mediator of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury. 28 All samples were run in duplicate, and the average concentrations were used for statistical analysis.
The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences in the clinical data and cytokine/chemokine levels between groups. Fisher's exact test was used for bivariate analysis of categorical data. The associations between cytokine/chemokine levels and clinical data were tested by linear regression analysis. To assess the goodness of fit of the linear regression model, R-squared measure was used. We used logistic regression analysis to analyze the relationship between independent outcome predictors and outcome.
To assess the goodness of fit of the logistic regression model, the Demographic and clinical data are summarized in Table 1 . The patients (32 boys and 25 girls) ranged in age from 1 month to 9 years (median, 9 months) and 44 (77%) children were less than 1 year old.
Twelve children had a medical history (pneumonia, n = 9; febrile convulsion, n = 1 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, n = 1 and hemosiderosis, n = 1) and two children were positive for human immunodeficiency virus. The median duration from the onset of illness to PICU admission was 9 days, and 21 (37%) patients were admitted to the PICU within 7 days of the onset of illness. The median P/F ratio was 78 mm Hg and 43 (75%) children showed a P/F ratio of ≤100 mm Hg with a PEEP ≥5 cm H 2 O on the day of PICU admission. All children were intubated and supported on a mechanical ventilator. The Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III score was assessed using parameters obtained during the first 12 h of stay in the PICU. 29 PRISM III scores were 0-23 (median 8.0). Glucocorticoid or high-dose intravascular immunoglobulin were administered to 46 (81%) and 36 (63%) children, respectively, as adjunct treatments depending on the physician's decision. Table 2 . Fifty-three (92%) patients were positive for either ADV-B or MeV or CMV. In addition,
infections (Table 1) . We screened CMV infection as a possible cause of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin, as we have observed many immunocompetent infants with CMV-associated pneumonia in our hospital. 30 Ninety-two percent (23 of 25) of CMV-positive children were co-infected with other viruses, and most CMV infections were considered to be opportunistic infections that followed infection with another virus or CMV-persistent infection. 31 The most commonly detected bacteria and fungi were Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans, which are generally considered to be opportunistic and nosocomial infections (Table 3) . Streptococcus pneumoniae, a representative pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia, was detected in two children with measles. Taken together, most cases of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in the present study developed from viral pneumonia rather than from primary bacterial pneumonia. Only 18 (32%) patients had bacteremia or fungemia (Table 3 ).
Thirty-two (56%) children died in the PICU (non-survivors) and nearly half died within the first 7 days after PICU admission. In this study, the survivors were PICU-survivors who were discharged from the PICU alive. As shown in Table 1 , there were no significant differences in According to another classification, IFN-γ is a type 1 cytokine, produced from T helper type 1 (Th1) lymphocytes and predominantly promotes cellmediated immunity. IL-10 is a type 2 cytokine produced from T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes and predominantly supports humoral immunity and antibody production. 32 Cytokines/chemokines are produced simultaneously and have counteracting effects.
Notably, the levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 and ratio of IFN-γ to IL-10 (IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio) in non-survivors was significantly higher than in survivors ( Table 4 ). The levels of IFN-γ were only associated with a fatal outcome and were not influenced by MeV, ADV-B, or bacterial/ fungal infection (Fig. 1A) . The IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio suggests a relative balance in the type 1 and type 2 cytokines. 32 The IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio was higher in non-survivors, indicating a greater Th1 predominance in non-survivors on the day of PICU admission. The ratio of IL-6 to IL-10 (IL-6/IL-10 ratio), which suggested a relative balance in proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, showed no The data presented as the number (%) or the median (interquartile range). The CRP were available for 31 non-survivors and 24 survivors. Fisher's exact test was employed for the bivariate analysis of the categorical data. The Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of continuous data between two groups. *P < 0.05.
were observed in non-survivors or ADV-B-infected children, and lower levels of IL-10 were observed in MeV-infected children (Fig. 1B ).
In addition, both the IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio and IL-6/IL-10 ratio were significantly increased in MeV-infected children compared to in uninfected children (Fig. 1C,D) . The higher IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio reflected lower IL-10 levels in MeV-infected patients (Fig. 1A,B) . The higher IL-6/IL-10 ratio reflected higher IL-6 (data not shown) and lower IL-10 levels in MeV-infected patients (Fig. 1B) . Patients with bacterial/fungal co-infections exhibited markedly higher levels of HMGB-1 compared to uninfected patients, but there were no differences in the levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 or the IFN-γ/IL10
and IL-6/IL-10 ratios between patients with and without bacterial/ fungal infections (Fig. 1A-E) .

The data presented as the number of patients whose samples were positive for the microorganisms during their PICU stay. (Table 5A ).
The only variable that modified the probability of the patient with a high serum IFN-γ concentration was a fatal outcome (R 2 = 0.248). We Therefore, the frequency of multiple virus infection in this study was not significantly associated with the measles outbreak.
The most frequently detected virus genome in TLF was AdV-B. In a previous study, we reported that children who died from measlesassociated pneumonia in our PICU during the same measles outbreak were complicated with ADV-B (type 7) pneumonia. 22 PICU-mortality was not associated with the type of causative pathogen, but rather with the inflammatory responses induced by host immunity. We evaluated the differences in serum levels of inflammatory mediators between non-survivors and survivors on the day of PICU admission and examined if they were associated with the type of infected pathogens. We found that the serum levels of IFN-γ were associated with fatal outcome (Fig. 1 and dengue patients. 37 IFN-γ has rarely been reported as a prognostic mediator for ARDS, but it was reported as one of the independent outcome predictors in H7N9-infected patients. 17 As shown in this study, particularly for children with severe ARDS of pulmonary origin with respiratory virus infection, we found that the serum level of IFN-γ was a possible prognostic factor of fatal outcome.
Serum levels of HMGB-1 were reported to be related to poor prognosis of ARDS patients. 38 In this study, the serum levels of HMGB-1
were higher in children with bacterial and fungal co-infections than in children with only viral infections, although, HMGB-1 levels were not | 1475 associated with a fatal outcome. The serum levels of IL-10 were associated with not only fatal outcome, but also MeV infection and AdV infection (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, IL-10 does not appear to be suitable as an independent prognostic factor of fatal outcome. The IL-6/IL-10 ratio was not associated with fatal outcome. The higher IL-6/IL-10 ratio on the day of PICU admission was thought to reflect measles-specific inflammatory responses. 34 The present study had some limitations. First, our sample size was small. Second, the results, particularly the types of detected virus genomes, may have been affected by a concurrent measles outbreak.
Third, we did not include data from healthy Vietnamese children of the same age as the controls. Thus, we could not compare the serum levels of each inflammatory mediator to those in healthy children. Fourth, PCR-detected virus was not necessarily a causative pathogen of the disease. Persistent ADV and CMV infections can be established after primary infection and may be detected in healthy children. 31, 39 Fifth, if the genomes of RNA viruses were degraded at the time of sample collection and if the primers or probe binding sequences were mutated, these genomes could not be detected. Sixth, other pathogens may have been present but not detected.
In summary, this is the first report to determine the profiles of pathogens involved in severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infection. We found that IFN-γ upregulation as detected on the day of PICU admission was one of the possible prognostic factors affecting a fatal outcome, rather than the type of pathogen. This suggests that modulation of the inflammatory response, regardless of the pathogen type, is critical for the clinical management of these patients.",Pathogen screening and prognostic factors in children with severe ARDS of pulmonary origin,"Phung, Thuy Thi Bich; Suzuki, Tadaki; Phan, Phuc Huu; Kawachi, Shoji; Furuya, Hiroyuki; Do, Huong Thu; Kageyama, Tsutomu; Ta, Tuan Anh; Dao, Nam Huu; Nunoi, Hiroyuki; Tran, Dien Minh; Le, Hai Thanh; Nakajima, Noriko",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5697698/,238,1811,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
162,22dce3fab7317bb2a8ff48f0da6f2c9717dc6ed9,"Astroviruses and kobuviruses are frequently found in mammalian feces, including that of humans. The present study examined fecal samples from 91 Korean dogs suffering from diarrhea. Canine astroviruses (CAstVs) and canine kobuviruses (CKoVs) were identified in 2 (2.1%) and 46 (50.6%) dogs, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis coupled with phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method showed that CAstVs clustered into four genetically diverse groups. Two Korean CAstVs belonged to group 2 alongside strains isolated in Italy and France. Twelve of the Korean CKoVs belonged to a single clade, along with strain UK003 identified in the UK and six CKoVs identified in the USA. Thus, the results suggest that the Korean strain of CAstV is closely related to strains isolated in Europe. Surely, CKoV in South Korea could identify the circulation among dogs population.","Astroviruses (AstVs) are small non-enveloped RNA viruses that were first identified in 1975 in samples taken from children suffering from diarrhea [1, 18] . In 1980, astrovirus-like particles (subsequently named canine astrovirus (CAstV)) were observed electron microscopically in diarrhea samples taken from beagle puppies [29] and in the feces of asymptomatic dogs [14] . Since then, there have been reports of CAstV in dogs in the U.S.A., Germany, Austria, Italy, China, France and Brazil [4, 7, 14, [27] [28] [29] 31] ; however, little is known about the clinical symptoms associated with CAstV infection.
Human Aichi virus (AiV) is a prototype kobuvirus, which was first identified in 1989 as the cause of an outbreak of human gastroenteritis in Aichi Prefecture, Japan [30] . Kobuviruses, which belong to the family Picornaviridae, are non-enveloped viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA genome; these viruses have been identified in sheep, goats, wild boar, rodents, dogs and cats [2, 3, 10, 12, 22, 24, 25] . In 2011, canine kobuvirus (CKoV) was identified in dogs in the U.S.A. [10, 13] , showing for the first time that domestic pets can be infected by members of this genus.
Previous studies have reported a significant association between the onset and severity of astrovirus infections and age in young puppies (5-7 weeks old) [7] , mink (3 weeks old) [6] and children (under 2 years old) [20] .
Sequence analysis of the complete CKoV genome revealed that the virus shows greatest sequence similarity to a recently identified murine kobuvirus, strain M-5/USA/2010 (84.0% identical at the amino acid (aa) level) [22] and to human AiVs (80.0% identical at the aa level) [21] . Few studies have examined astroviruses and kobuviruses in dogs, and little information is available regarding their prevalence, genetic diversity and pathogenicity.
Therefore, the aims of the present study were to examine the prevalence, genetic diversity and geographical relationships between CAstVs and CKoVs in Korean dogs.
Between February and December 2010, samples of dog feces (n=91) were collected from two animal shelters and three animal hospitals located in Seoul and the Gyeonggi region of South Korea. All dogs were aged between 1 and 24 months and were suffering from diarrhea. Infection with canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) was diagnosed by PCR using previously described primer sets [9, 23] .
Viral RNA was extracted with TRIzol ® (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA. U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then reverse transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR and random hexamers (Invitrogen; Cat. No. 18080-051). The primers used to amplify part of the CAstV ORF2 gene were modified from those described previously [31] : forward primer, 5′-TGGCTGGACCACGTGAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCACGTTTAGGTCGAGA-3′. The primers used to amplify a partial sequence from CKoV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were also modified from those previously published [10] : forward primer, 5′-CTCCCCT-CAGCTGCCTTCTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAGGATCT-GAAATTTGGAAG-3′. The PCR conditions used to amplify CAstV were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 53°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR conditions used to amplify CKoV were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 52°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The resulting PCR products (196 bp for CAstV and 252 bp for CKoV) were separated on a 1% agarose gel, isolated and then cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega Of the 91 samples tested, CAstV, CKoV, CPV and CCoV were identified in 2 (2.2%), 46 (50.5%), 49 (53.8%) and 61 (67.0%), respectively. The partial CAstV ORF2 nucleotide sequences from two Korean strains and from 13 strains identified in other countries were aligned using the CLUSTAL X [26] and BIOEDIT programs [8] . Based on these sequence alignments, 15 CAstV strains were divided into four groups; the level of sequence similarity between the four groups was<80% ( Table 1 ). The level of sequence similarity within groups, however, was higher. The SH8 strain (China), the 4255-239 strain (France) and strains 1068, 915, 905 and 1093 (Brazil) belonged to group 1, and all showed a high level of sequence similarity at the nucleotide level (91.3-93.4%). Seven strains (8/05, 6/05, 3/05, 4255-299, 4255-93, CAstV-K47 and CAstV-K48) belonged to group 2 and also showed high sequence homology (94.9-99.5%) at the nucleotide level (data not shown). The sequence homology between CAstVs and AstVs isolated from other animal species (mink, pig, rabbit, mouse, duck and human) was low (45.9-63.3%) ( Table 1) .
A previous study showed that AstVs circulating in French kennels showed a higher level of genetic diversity (nucleotide sequence similarity ranging from 72.5-99.5%) than those identified in puppies presenting at a clinic in China (nucleotide sequence similarity ranging from 96.7-99.8%) [31] . The discrepancy between these levels of nucleotide sequence similarity may explain the genetic diversity of the French CAstVs examined in the present study; the French CAstVs belonged to groups 1, 2 and 4, while all of the Chinese CAstVs belonged to group 1.
We next constructed a phylogenetic tree for the partial CAstV ORF2 gene using the Mega 4.1 program [11] . As shown in Fig. 1 , the sequences clustered into four genetically diverse groups. Six CAstV strains belonged to group 1, seven strains belonged to group 2, and one strain (GI.E/ Dog/ITA/2010/Zoid) from Italy and one strain (4255-280) from France belonged to groups 3 and 4, respectively. A previous study suggested that a closer examination of the phylogenetic tree revealed that CAstV sequences appeared to cluster according to their place of origin (e.g., country or kennel) [7] . Another study showed that CAstVs are both genetically and antigenically heterogeneous, showing levels of variation similar to those in human GI.A AstV types 1 to 8 [16, 19] . The Korean CAstVs belonging to genotype G2 may be more related to viruses isolated from Europe than to viruses isolated from China; however, further studies are needed to confirm this.
Recent molecular studies indicate that CAstVs are widespread among the canine population, occurring either as single infections or as co-infections with other viral pathogens [17] . This suggests that CAstVs may be enteric pathogens in young dogs. CAstVs are associated with outbreaks of enteritis in puppies infected with CAstV alone or co-infected with CAstV and either CCoV or CPV [15] . Two Korean CAstVs detected in samples from shelter dogs were found in conjunction with CCoV and CKoV; however, the clinical characteristics of enteric infection by CAstVs are unknown.
Of the 46 Korean CKoV strains examined, 34 had the same partial RdRp nucleotide sequence as 12 strains (Fig.  2) . Twelve Korean CKoV strains showed 95.2-96.8% similarity at the nucleotide level. CKoV-K7 showed the closest relationships with UK003 (97.2%) from the U.K. and with CKoV-009 (92.8%) from the U.S.A. (Table 2 ). In addition, CKoVs and kobuviruses identified in three animal species (mouse, cat and human) showed a high level of sequence similarity (80.9-87.6%) ( Table 1) .
Based on sequence analysis of the complete genome, CKoV showed the closest genetic relationship with a recently identified mouse kobuvirus, M-5/USA/2010 (84.0% identical at the aa level) [22] , and with a human AiV (80.0% identical at the aa level) [5] .
The phylogenetic tree derived from partial RdRp gene sequences from various animal species showed that CKoVs clustered into a single clade, which contained 12 CKoVs from Korea, one CKoV (UK003) from the U.K., and six CKoVs from the U.S.A. CKoVs were also closely related to a feline kobuvirus (12Q87-2) and a murine kobuvirus (M-5). Previous studies have shown that CKoVs are not geographically restricted to the North American continent on which they were first identified [10, 13] . The present study did not find evidence of genetic diversity between viruses identified in the U.S.A., U.K. and Korea, which are representative of three different continents.
Of the CKoV-positive dogs, 2.34% (6/256) presented with diarrhea and were either infected by CKoV alone or were co-infected with CCoV and/or CPV-2 [5] . Although it is dif- ficult to directly associate CKoV infection with clinical signs of enteric disease [13] , we did find that some Korean dogs were co-infected with CKoVs and other viral pathogens that are known to cause enteric disease. For example, 18 dogs were infected with CCoV+CKoV, 10 with CPV+CKoV, 14 with CCoV+CPV+CKoV and 2 with CCoV+CAstV+CKoV (data not shown). Infection by CKoVs was more prevalent in samples from shelters than in samples from animal hospitals (Table 3 ).
In conclusion, of the four genetically diverse groups identified by phylogenetic analysis, Korean CAstVs were classified into group 2 and were closely related to strains identified in Europe. CKoVs do not yet show evidence of genetic diversity, and Korean CKoVs could identify the circulation with viral pathogens that associated to enteric diseases among dogs population.
The nucleotide sequences of CAstV and CKoV isolated from Korean dogs were submitted to GenBank under the following accession numbers: KF663753 to KF663754 for the partial ORF2b region sequences derived from CAstV; and KF663755 to KF663766 for the partial RdRp region sequences derived from CKoV. Data were evaluated using Fishers exact test. P values<0.05 were considered significant. a) OR, Odds ratio; b) CI, Confidential interval.",Phylogenetic Analysis of Astrovirus and Kobuvirus in Korean Dogs,"CHOI, Sarah; LIM, Seong-In; KIM, Yong Kwan; CHO, Yoon-Young; SONG, Jae-Young; AN, Dong-Jun",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155196/,132,1548,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus-host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus-Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus-virus, virushost and host-host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus-virus and virus-host interactions (2671 nonredundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 nonredundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data. The VirHostNet Web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network. Public access to the VirHostNet knowledge-based system is available at","Eukaryotic cells express a large panel of proteins that coordinately participate to the cellular machinery through a highly connected and regulated network of protein-protein interactions (1) . Physical architecture of model organisms and human cellular protein networks exhibits a strong robustness against random failures, and strikingly a high sensitivity to targeted attacks on highly connected and central proteins, also called 'hubs' (2, 3) . Cellular protein network is not static and its robustness may change dynamically according to various factors like tissue and cell-line origins, signals received by cellular environment or more specifically during viral infections (4) . Replication and pathogenesis of viruses depend on a complex interplay between viral and host cellular proteins both acting through a complex network of protein-protein interactions. In order to evade the cell innate immune response and/or to favour their own replication and transmission, viruses have developed strategies to hijack central functions of the cell (5) (6) (7) . Viruses also use intra-viral, i.e. virus-virus, protein-protein interactions for virion assembly or viral egress from the cell. Accumulation of functional perturbations associated with such virus-virus and virus-host protein-protein interactions may lead to severe and complex diseases, like the development of cancers (8, 9) . From a systems biology perspective, a deeper understanding of infectious diseases may rely on an exhaustive characterization of all potential interactions occurring between proteins encoded by viruses and those expressed in infected cells (10) . Thus, integration of all protein-protein interactions into an infected cellular network, or 'infectome', is a great challenge that may provide a powerful framework for virtual modelling and analysis of viral infection.
The first draft of the human cellular network, also referred to the human interactome, has been explored at the proteome-wide level by the mean of high-throughput experiments such as yeast-two hybrid screens (11, 12) or tap-tag procedure (13) . The overall quality and completeness of this human cellular network has been significantly improved thanks to systematic approaches based on text-mining and literature-curated interactions extracted from low-throughput experiments. Many generalized and specialized databases are involved in the integration of these protein-protein interactions, such as BIND (14) , MINT (15) , INTACT (16) , HPRD (17) , DIP (18) , BIOGRID (19) , REACTOME (20) , GENERIF (21) and NETWORKIN (22) . However, the low redundancy of interactions found between these databases has raised the need to unify such data resources for human and model organisms (23) . Concerning virus-virus and virus-host protein-protein interactions, few high-throughput experiments have been achieved, except some yeast-two hybrid screens completed for Herpes viruses (EBV, KSH, VZV, HSV-1) (24) (25) (26) and SARS (27) . Although some generalist databases like BIND, MINT, INTACT and HIV-GENERIF provide access to virus-virus and virus-host protein-protein interactions, no systematic approach has been reported to exhaustively mine and curate all interactions that have accumulated in scientific publications.
In this context, we have developed VirHostNet (Virus-Host Network), a public knowledge-based system specialized in the management, analysis and integration of virus-virus, virus-host and host-host interactions as well as their functional annotations in the cell. Based on an extensive scientific literature expertise, VirHostNet provides a high-confidence resource of manually curated interactions defined for a wide range of viral species. The content of this high-confidence dataset has been illustrated by the analysis of cellular functions and pathways enriched in proteins targeted by one or many viruses. An integrated cellular network has also been reconstructed from public data and combined with viral data to provide the first draft of the infected cellular network. In addition, an original Web interface has been developed, which provides multi-criteria query and visualization tools for infection network navigation. The utility of the visualisator has been exemplified by network representation of the mTOR pathway and its interplay with viruses.
A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to fully integrate virus-virus, virus-host and host-host protein-protein interactions gathered from a wide range of public databases, with those mined from scientific literature and curated by VirHostNet experts (Figure 1 ). In addition to the management of this large protein interaction resource, VirHostNet integrates contextual information concerning interacting proteins, like structural and functional annotations of proteins: Gene Ontology term (28) , KEGG pathway (29) , INTERPRO domain (30) . All these data were integrated into a knowledge-based system implemented by using PostgreSQL DataBase Management System (release 8.2.6).
The low level of redundancy observed among available databases involved in molecular interactions management has emphasized the need to integrate these heterogeneous data sources (23) . Virus-virus, virus-host and host-host protein-protein interactions and meta-data related to experimental procedures or publications were extracted from 10 databases (BIND, MINT, INTACT, HPRD, DIP, BIOGRID, REACTOME, GENERIF, HIV-GENERIF, NETWORKIN) ( Figure 1 ). Due to the heterogeneity of protein sequence identification found across these databases (i.e. gene identification number, gene name, protein accession number, protein name), NCBI and ENSEMBL protein sequence databases were chosen to unify virus and host proteins respectively (see Supplementary Table 1A) . Towards this end, the IPI database system (31) was chosen to cross-reference all the human protein sequences to ENSEMBL protein accession numbers. In addition, viral protein sequences defined at EMBL and UNIPROT were mapped on NCBI protein sequences by using BLAST Alignment software (32) . Protein cross-referencing led to the definition of nonredundant protein-protein interactions that were in many cases defined in different databases, publications or supported by distinct experimental procedures (see Supplementary Table 1B) . Thus, all information associated with non-redundant interactions, like database origin, experimental procedure description in PSI-MI 2.5 standard format (33) or PUBMED identification (PMID) number, were retrieved in VirHostNet to provide the most documented interactions. This compilation of interaction meta-data will facilitate data quality filtering based on the number of databases, methods or PMIDs used (34, 35) .
An automatic text-mining pipeline was developed and plugged into the VirHostNet system in order to prioritize scientific papers for protein-protein interaction curation. As a first step, all abstracts containing keywords related to both viruses and experimental procedures used for interactions identification (mainly yeast-two hybrid, co-imunoprecipitation, pull-down and tandem affinity purification) were extracted for an in-depth expertise. During curation, protein-protein interactions were carefully annotated according to: (i) the protein accession numbers of each of the protein interactor, the human and/or viral proteins being respectively referenced to ENSEMBL and NCBI accession numbers; (ii) the molecular interaction methods based on the PSI-MI 2.5 ontology vocabulary; and (iii) the PMIDs. Based on 1174 selected PMIDs, literature curation led to the annotation of 2186 redundant interactions in 723 papers (Supplementary Table 2 ). This effort significantly complemented data from public databases with 1297 new non-redundant protein-protein interactions. In order to provide a higher level of data accuracy, virus-virus and virus-host protein-protein interactions from public databases were also carefully inspected.
From 2294 PMIDs for which at least one protein-protein interaction was defined, database curation led to the validation of 2261 redundant interactions found in 789 papers, corresponding to 1374 confirmed non-redundant proteinprotein interactions (Supplementary Table 2 ). Strikingly, our experts confirmed 20% of BIND and GENERIF (HIV) against 90-95% for MINT and INTACT data.
One reason is that all protein-protein interactions defined by functional associations and/or genetic interactions between proteins were discarded from BIND and HIV-GENERIF.
To our knowledge, VirHostNet provides the largest and the most confident infected cellular network. This network is composed of 2671 virus-virus and virus-host non-redundant protein-protein interactions concerning 180 distinct viral species. The curated protein-protein interactions were mainly defined by low-throughput and high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screens (40%), co-immunoprecipitation (24%) and pull-down (21%) (Figure 2A ). Even if only 65% of interactions rely on a single experimental procedure, a total of 944 proteinprotein interactions (35%) were defined by at least two independent methods, in good agreement with other high-confidence databases (36) ( Figure 2B ). All these interactions were defined in 36 distinct viral families, underlying the broad taxonomical diversity provided by VirHostNet ( Figure 3A ). In addition, the distribution of interactions observed among viral Baltimore groups should allow large-scale comparative study of virus-virus ( Figure 3B ) and virus-host networks ( Figure 3C ).
In the infection network, the virus-host interactions occurred between 407 viral proteins and 1012 human proteins, suggesting the strong tendency of viruses to interact with a large number of cellular proteins. In order to characterize cellular functions targeted by the viral machinery, we performed functional enrichment analysis of host proteins interacting with viruses, by using Gene Ontology and KEGG databases and the same methodology described by Zheng and Wang (37) (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 , respectively). The results showed that viruses interact significantly with a large panel of cellular functions (e.g. cell cycle, apoptosis, cell communication, protein transport) and with canonical signalling pathways (e.g. Jak-Stat, Toll-like Receptor, MAPK, TGF-b, mTOR). The majority of these functions and pathways have already been described to participate in either viral infectious cycle, cellular anti-viral mechanisms or viral associated diseases (38) . Interestingly, analysis of KEGG pathways revealed cellular mechanisms poorly documented in the case of viral infections. One example is focal adhesion, a pathway involved in cell contact with the extracellular matrix and in many other cellular processes including invasion, motility, proliferation and apoptosis (39) . Indeed, on 202 protein members of the focal adhesion pathway, more than 25% (59) were found significantly targeted (exact Fisher test, Benjamini-Hochberg multiple correction test P-value < 0.05) by at least one viral protein in 36 distinct viral taxons. This may suggest the central role of focal adhesion during viral infections and its potential impact on viral induced cancer development that might be associated for instance to the loss of cellular adhesion. Although cellular functions of proteins are far from being completely known and/or annotated in public databases, based on the 'guilty by association' concept the human protein-protein network may serve as a template to complete our understanding on cellular functions perturbed during viral infection. In order to include virusvirus and virus-host interactions in their cellular context, a human-human protein interaction network containing roughly 70 000 non-redundant protein-protein interactions and 10 000 proteins was built from public databases (details on interaction methods distribution are given in Supplementary Figure 1) . Thus, based on roughly 40 000 unique proteins annotated in ENSEMBL, 25% (10 000/ 40 000) are connected within the human protein network. Analysis of the infection network revealed that surprisingly 88% (881/1012) of targeted human proteins interact with at least one cellular protein. Thus, targeted proteins tend to physically interact in the cell and may probably participate in cross-linked functions and pathways. Based on protein neighbourhood or sub-networks, the human protein-protein interaction network may help to elucidate new protein regulators or modular functions associated to viral or cellular anti-viral strategies.
A user friendly and powerful Web interface based on PHP, JAVA and AJAX technologies was developed. This interface is intended to facilitate: (i) protein and contextual based queries (ii) protein-protein interaction quality filtering and display; (iii) protein-protein interaction network query (viral and host neighbours, virus-virus, virus-host, host-host sub-networks); and (iv) protein network graphical visualization. Description and examples of the database features are available in the Wiki page of the VirHostNet Web site (http://pbildb1.univ-lyon1.fr/virhost net/wiki).
Once logged-in, VirHostNet users can directly query the knowledge base by using a wide range of information concerning viral (e.g. NCBI protein name or accession number) or human proteins (e.g. ENSEMBL gene or protein accession number, NCBI gene name, REFSEQ protein accession number and UNIPROT primary and secondary accession numbers) ( Figure 4A ). AJAX technology was incorporated to control protein name and accession number availability in VirHostNet. Another important feature of the interface is batch query. It allows in-depth analysis of interaction profiles with cellular and/or viral proteins from a list of proteins defined for instance in high-throughput studies (microarray, yeasttwo hybrid). A list of genes or proteins of interest can also be assessed by the mean of contextual information, such as taxonomical information, Gene Ontology terms, KEGG pathways and INTERPRO protein domains. These properties offer a unique access to protein-protein interaction networks: (i) associated to a specific virus taxon or (ii) underlying canonical sub-cellular localization, cellular functions and pathways.
To access protein-protein interactions from a list of proteins ( Figure 4B ), users have: (i) to select all or a subset of proteins of interest; (ii) to define the kind of interactions to retrieve (virus-virus, virus-host and hosthost) and their database origin and (iii) to select the mode of navigation to perform, either protein neighbours or protein subgraph ( Figure 4C ). Neighbours are viral or cellular proteins interacting directly with a protein of interest. A subgraph (or subnetwork) is a graph made of all interactions between a set of proteins. The resulting host-host, virus-host and/or virus-virus protein-protein interactions are then given into a tabulated format in three independent tabbed panels ( Figure 4D ). For each protein-protein interaction, users have a privileged access to interaction meta-data ( Figure 4E ) and a colour code highlights interactions that have been checked by VirHostNet experts.
Beside table representation of protein-protein interactions, a more dynamic and interactive network visualization tool was specifically developed for graph representation of infection networks. This new network visualisator was fully implemented in Jung 2.0 (http://jung.sourceforge.net) as a Java Web applet. It efficiently takes into account viruses and host nodes dichotomy for both graph rendering (colour of nodes) and navigation (host and viral neighbours). The visualisator provides also sliders to dynamically filter graphs based on the number of PMIDs and experimental procedures used to identify interactions. Additional features are also provided to draw protein node size according to the number of viral or host interacting partners (i.e. their degree into the virus-virus, virushost, host-host networks) or to highlight targeted proteins. As a case study, we built a protein sub-network view of the mTOR KEGG signalling pathway that has been found significatively enriched in targeted proteins (Supplementary Table 4 ). Indeed, the modulation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal transduction pathway by viruses has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibition of apoptosis, cell survival, cell transformation, viral replication and viral assembly (40, 41) . To identify and compare how viruses interplay with this network, virus-host protein interactions annotated by VirHostNet were added. This mTOR-infection network is composed of 42 cellular interacting proteins (blue nodes), 10 viral proteins (coloured nodes according to viral taxonomy), 84 host-host (blue edges) and 14 virus-host (red edges) physical proteinprotein interactions ( Figure 5 ). Protein network visualization showed that cellular proteins of this pathway are highly inter-connected in contrast to the classical representation given by the KEGG pathway, underlying the extreme complexity and regulation of this pathway. Moreover, graph visualization allows identifying viral proteins targeting multiple cellular proteins (e.g. NS5A protein interacting with AKT1, PDPK1 and PIK3CB) and reciprocally cellular proteins interacting with multiple viral proteins (e.g. HIF1A interacting with LANA of Human Herpes Virus 8 type P and X protein of Hepatitis B Virus). Hence, the VirHostNet interface allows users to visualize protein interaction networks associated to any kind of GO term, KEGG pathway, list of proteins or keywords and to analyse how they interplay with viruses.
VirHostNet provides now a public access to the largest known resource of integrated virus-virus, virus-host and host-host protein interaction networks. Literature-and database-curated interactions have led to the definition of an original and high-confidence protein-protein interactions dataset. We have briefly illustrated the need of this high-confidence dataset for the characterization of cellular functions targeted by viruses. This resource may also be crucial for network-based analysis of molecular mechanisms involved during viral infections, such as cellular network properties disturbed after the connection of viral proteins. VirHostNet will also provide a backbone for automatic screening of specific protein domains or peptides motifs associated to virus-host interactions and hence may help to delineate at the proteome-wide scale footprints in both viral and host proteins sequences. VirHostNet will allow systematic prediction of virushost protein-protein interologs based on sequence homology criteria between closely related viral proteins. The knowledge-based system is also intended to integrate virus-host protein-protein interactions data derived by our team from high-throughput yeast-two hybrids experiments (Orthomyxovirus, Paramyxovirus, Flavivirus . . .). Thus, the availability of virus-virus and virus-host networks for a broad range of viruses will encourage comparative analysis and will be very helpful for the identification of molecular interactions associated to viral pathogenesis or virulence. As virus-host and virusvirus protein-protein interactions curation is one of the central features of the VirHostNet knowledge base, one of our missions is to keep these data up to date Users can select one or more proteins from the list of proteins (by default, all proteins are selected). Then, from the preferences panel, they have to choose the kind of interaction to retrieve (virus-virus, virus-host or host-host) or the database origin. Finally, they have to choose an operation ('neighbours' or 'sub-graph'). The 'neighbours' button allows users to retrieve all direct protein-protein interactions from a single protein or a list of selected proteins. The 'sub-graph' button allows users to retrieve only protein-protein interactions occurring between selected proteins (see result in Figure 4D ). (D) List of the 89 protein-protein interactions occurring between proteins of the mTOR pathway. For the interacting proteins, NCBI taxonomy name, ENSEMBL gene acc (host)-NCBI protein acc (viruses) and official gene name (host)-product name (viruses) are given. The '?' link at the end of each interaction line allows users to access interaction annotations ( Figure 4E ). In the protein-protein interactions research panel, in addition to 'neighbours' and 'sub-graph' buttons, the 'visualize' button allows from a list of interactions the graphical visualization of the resulting network (see result in Figure 5 ). (E) More detailed information concerning protein-protein interactions are available. PMID, PSI-MI method accession number and database origin of the selected interaction are given.
continuously from data published in scientific journals. The update of public databases will occur at least once or twice a year in order to keep the data as current as possible. In the next future, integration of other host species, such as mammals or insects, is envisaged. This will facilitate comparison of interaction profiles among different hosts and thus may help to elucidate the molecular basis underlying the ability of some viruses to overcome the inter-species barrier. Efforts will be made to facilitate data exchange with other generalist databases (MINT, INTACT) and to add Web2.0 capabilities to the Web interface (save, comparison and analysis of user customized networks). Altogether, VirHostNet provides an entry gate for proteome wide analysis of the virus-host system and will greatly help scientists willing to take advantage of functional genomic and systems biology to decipher viral infection, evolution and pathogenesis mechanisms and/or to rationalize anti-viral drug design.

VirHostNet Visualisator. Graph representation of the mTOR-infection network is drawn (right of the applet). Only interacting proteins of the mTOR pathway are represented (cellular proteins = blue nodes; host-host protein-protein interactions = blue edges). Viral interacting proteins are also added to define the infection network (viral proteins = coloured nodes according to viral taxonomy; virus-host protein-protein interactions = red edges). Cellular proteins of the network targeted by at least one viral protein (red stroke) are highlighted. The width of the edges is roughly proportional to the number of PMIDs used to describe the interaction. The width of the nodes is roughly proportional to the cellular degree, i.e. the number of cellular partners in the whole network. The taxonomical classification of viral proteins interacting with the mTOR network is given (left panel of the applet). The menu of the applet (top of the applet) allows users to define nodes and edges preferences (width, colour, labelling), interaction filtering (according to the number of methods, number of PMIDs or both), network navigation (expand viral or host neighbours) and graph layout. To obtain this figure, from the list of the 89 selected protein-protein interactions obtained in Figure 4E , users have to click on 'visualize' button. Then from the applet, in picking mode, they have to select all proteins and ask for viral proteins neighbours (in expand menu).",VirHostNet: a knowledge base for the management and the analysis of proteome-wide virus–host interaction networks,"Navratil, Vincent; de Chassey, Benoît; Meyniel, Laurène; Delmotte, Stéphane; Gautier, Christian; André, Patrice; Lotteau, Vincent; Rabourdin-Combe, Chantal",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686459/,194,3378,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
164,6b399b83db192f4d005e6950ca0e7b77060500a7,"Camels have cultural value in the Arab society and are considered one of the most important animals in the Arabian Peninsula and arid environments, due to the distinct characteristics of their meat and milk. Moreover, there is a great interest in camel racing and beauty shows. Therefore, treatment of elite animals, increasing the number of camels as well as genetic improvement is an essential demand. Because there are unique camels for milk production, meat, or in racing, the need to propagate genetically superior camels is urgent. Recent biotechnological approaches such as stem cells hold great promise for biomedical research, genetic engineering, and as a model for studying early mammalian developmental biology. Establishment of stem cells lines from camels would tremendously facilitate regenerative medicine for genetically superior camels, permit the gene targeting of the camel genome and the generation of genetically modified animal and be a mean for genome conservation for the elite breeds. In this mini-review, we show the current research, future horizons and potential applications for camel stem cells.","The Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a unique species and can be a better provider of meat and milk in desert areas than other farm animals, which are severely affected by heat and scare feed and water [1] . Camels occupy a special niche in the Arabian agricultural production system. The total population of dromedary is estimated to be about 25 million heads all over the world [updated according [2, 3] ].
Camel racing is a highly lucrative and well-organized sport and considered an important traditional and animal agribusiness activity in the Arabian Gulf states [2] . Since the major injuries in racing are fractures and because camels are often nervous, camel orthopedics is poorly understood because of a lack of comprehensive studies on fracture healing [4] . Moreover, there are numerous constraints of camel orthopedics; hence, the principles of bovine and equine orthopedics cannot be applied on camels in absolute terms [5] . Therefore, a basic understanding of bone and cartilage repair is essential to save the lives of thousands of camels used for this agribusiness throughout the world. The bone tissue engineering concept is a relatively new method for repairing damaged bones and involves the regeneration of tissues using stem cells, scaffolds, and growth factors, with stem cells playing a leading role in tissue repair and regeneration [6] [7] [8] .
Additionally, industry has attracted investments in camel dairy byproducts, as 16.9% of milk consumed by humans comes from species other than cattle [9, 10] . However, there is a significant variability in the milk yield among individuals (i.e. high milk producing camels can produce 12-fold more milk than low-producing ones) [2, 11] . Camels can produce milk and sustain its productivity in harsh and hostile conditions where other animals may not survive [12] . Camel milk is a rich source of proteins with potential antimicrobial and protective activities compared to cow's milk. In many countries, camel milk is given to babies suffering from malnutrition or milk sensitivity [13] . Compared to cow, buffalo, and ewe milk fat, camel milk fat contains fewer short-chained fatty acids, but the same long-chained fatty acids can be found. Some researchers claim that the value of camel milk is found in the high concentrations of volatile acids especially linoleic and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for human nutrition [14] . Camel milk has a high vitamin (especially C, B1), minerals and immunoglobulin content. Additionally, camel milk is low in lactose and cholesterol compared to cow's milk [15] . However, the levels of potassium, magnesium, iron, copper, manganese, sodium and zinc are higher than in cow's milk [13, 16] . Therefore, it is necessary to treat injuries and propagate the numbers of high-value milk producers through cloning technology to conserve the genetic merits of these camels, especially when traditional breeding practices are difficult and of low efficiency [17, 18] .
Nanobodies are unique compounds secreted by members of the camelids family [19] . According to Muyldermans et al., heavy chainonly antibodies (HCAbs) that circulate in the blood of camels are different from the antibodies produced by other species [20] . These antibodies lack the light chains and are composed of a heavy-chain homodimer. They are termed as variable domain of heavy chain of HCAb (VHH) or nanobody and have various therapeutic advantages. Nanobodies are single domain antibodies derived from heavy chainonly antibodies (HCAbs) produced naturally by camelids [21] . They are considered a new generation of active proteins with unique properties. Nanobodies show excellent tissue distribution, high temperature and pH stability, are easy to produce with recombinant technology and can readily be converted into different formats such as Fc-fusion proteins or heterodimers. Moreover, nanobodies have the unique ability to bind molecular clefts, such as the active site of enzymes, thereby interfering with the function of the target protein [22] . Over the last decade, numerous nanobodies have been developed against proteins involved in inflammation, with the aim to modulate their immune functions [23] [24] [25] . Recently, nanobodies have emerged as potential candidates for targeting cancer. Owing to their very small size, they are able to penetrate the typically inaccessible parts of the solid tumors with low immunogenicity [26] . Nanobodies are also considered as a significant tool in various therapeutic disciplines due to their unique ability to bind or attach to other proteins and nanoparticles by using noncomplex chemical treatments. Furthermore, cell permeable nanobodies have been recently discovered that could permit the co-transport of therapeutically relevant proteins into target cells [27] . This technology constitutes a major step in the labelling, delivery and targeted manipulation of intracellular protein antigens. Ultimately, this approach could open the door towards targeting the intracytoplasmic pathways of living cells and the expansion of immunotherapies to intracellular antigen targets.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells and have the ability to differentiate into all tissues and cells comprising the human and animal tissues, such as muscle, liver, brain, bone and cartilage tissues. ESCs are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) at the early stage of embryo development, the blastocyst. They can differentiate into three germ layers; the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, which give rise to all the tissues constituting the body [28, 29] .
Cells can be transformed into a pluripotent state through cocktail of defined factors such as Oct4 and Sox2 in conjunction with Myc and Klf4 or Nanog and Lin28 as reported recently. The resultant cells were termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and this achievement was awarded Nobel Prize in 2012. The camel is a unique species with high endurance to life in desert conditions; however, little information are known about camels' early embryonic development and the genes responsible for pluripotency. iPSCs can be generated from differentiated cells by the retrovirus-mediated transfection of four transcription factors, namely Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 [30, 31] . On the other hand, Thomson's team generated iPSCs using another cocktail of transcription factors which are Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28 [31] . Interestingly, iPSCs show a great deal of potential for stem cell therapies and clinical applications particularly for elite animals [32] , could generate patientor disease-specific stem cells, which are required for their effective biomedical applications, such as regenerative medicine [33] . Consequently, iPSCs could be used for regenerative medicine in precious genetically superior camels used for racing and beauty shows. The pioneering technology of iPSCs made reprogramming much easier than it had been with early reprogramming technologies, such as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), as well as avoided the ethical issues such as the embryo or fetus' destruction that was necessary for harvesting ESCs. Importantly, the generation of patient-specific iPSCs could be used to improve and test new drugs in vitro [34] .
Despite their applicative potential, it seems that iPSCs in farm animals have not received the attention they deserve [15, 35, 36] . Few studies have shown the derivation of iPSCs from farm animals such as cattle [37] , horses [38] , sheep [39] , goats [40] and pigs [23, 41] . However, there is no report on the generation of iPSCs from camels.
There are very few studies covered the camel stem cells and this field still in its early infancy. Recently, for the first time, we have isolated ESCs and trophectoderm stem cells from camel embryos on feeder-free conditions and showed the expression of all pluripotency genes (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc) in the established cell lines through the conventional and real-time relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR and RQ-PCR) [42] . The isolated ESCs were successfully differentiated into neuron-like cells. Moreover, we found a differential expression of certain genes such as Klf4, which showed significant increase in trophoblasts when compared with the ESCs which raises the question as to whether Klf4 or other transcripts are essential for pluripotency in camels. These results motivated our team to sequence and identify the whole genes' sequences responsible for the pluripotency in camels and clone these genes to be easily used for transforming the differentiated somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells following the transfection of the cells with pluripotency transcription factors. Interestingly, BLAST analysis (The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) for the predicted camel genes showed ∼90% matching with those known in humans (Table 1) .
This preliminary result motivated us to specifically isolate and identify pluripotency genes and used them for generating iPSCs from camels, instead of using commercially available factors designed for human or mouse cells. The best source for isolating the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of these genes are the blastocyst stage of in vivo or in vitro produced embryos. Fortunately, our team has successfully established system for in vitro production of camel embryos either through in vitro techniques [43, 44] or through the flushing of in vivo fertilized ones.
Another team has isolated the mesenchymal stem cells from camel adipose tissue and showed its differentiation capabilities into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic cells [45] .
Our current work focuses on utilizing novel and easy sources for isolating pluripotent or multipotent stem cells from the camels such as the ovarian follicular cells [35, 46, 47] . These cells could be obtained either from slaughter house or by follicle aspiration from live animals. Our ongoing experiments and results are encouraging and showed that camel follicular cells can be differentiated easily into adipocytes, osteoblasts and neurons. 
Pluripotent stem cells are promising not only for medical applications, but could also have numerous uses in biotechnology and agriculture. Advanced reproduction techniques in farm animals could enable the development of genetically modified animals from engineered pluripotent stem cells; SCNT is a method of choice when producing transgenic farm animals [48] and the use of genetically engineered pluripotent stem cells (i.e. ESCs or iPSCs capable of generating offspring through nuclear transfer) as donor cells could efficiently improve the procedure's success, as already shown in mice [49] .
Since the birth of Dolly the sheep [50] , the first cloned mammal, an ever-growing number of studies worldwide have helped to substantiate the potential applications of somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning) to overcome several problems in various biology fields, such as generating copies of particular species including camels [51] and extinct or endangered species and for the propagation of the livestock and elite animals [5, 10, 52, 53] . This technology can be used to propagate camels with the highest potential for milk production, beauty contests or racing champions. However, the use of this technique is limited owing to its low efficiency particularly in camels [52] and several trials have attempted to improve the cloning efficiencies [24] . Moreover, reports have showed the advantageous effects of using iPSCs as donor cells for SCNT [49, 54, 55] to improve the cloning efficiency and to generate genetically modified organisms for therapeutic cloning [53, 56] and transgenesis to generate genetically engineered camels which would be acting as bioreactors to produce specific nanobodies for therapeutic purposes [30, 44, 51, 57, 58] . Production of antibodies from genetically engineered cattle [56, 57, [59] [60] [61] paved the way for the application in the camelids, which are the source of nanobodies.
The potential applications of using both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for camel agribusiness can be summarized as following (see also Fig. 1 ):
1. Regenerative medicine and personalized cell therapy for traumatic, injured, or fractured elite and genetically superior camels used for show, racing or milking. 2. Camel iPSCs will be used for the genome conservation of elite genetically valuable animals, such as high milk producers, racing champions, and males of high genetic merit. 3. Understanding the functions of individual pluripotency gene overexpression on early embryonic development in camels. 4. Improving the cloning efficiency of camels through using pluripotency genes' over-expressed cell lines, either individual or combined. 5. Generating bioreactors capable of producing therapeutic targeted nanobodies for human diseases. 6.

We report the first application to our knowledge of this technology to the analysis of RNA from a CD4 ؉ T cell line infected with intact HIV. We sequenced the total mRNA from infected cells and detected differences in the expression of both host and viral mRNA. Viral reads represented a large portion of the total mapped sequencing reads: approximately 20% at 12 h postinfection (hpi) and 40% at 24 hpi. We also detected a small but significant suppression of T cell activation-related genes at 12 hpi. This suppression persisted and expanded by 24 hpi, providing new possible markers of virus-induced T cell cytopathology. By 24 hpi, the expression of over 50% of detectable host loci was also altered, indicating widespread alteration of host processes, including RNA processing, splicing, and transport to an extent not previously reported. In addition, next-generation sequencing provided insights into alternative viral RNA splice events and the expression of noncoding RNAs, including microRNA host genes.

Next-generation sequencing reveals HIV-1-mediated suppression of T cell activation and RNA processing and regulation of noncoding RNA expression in a CD4 ϩ T cell line. mBio 2(5):e00134-11.","T he hallmark of AIDS is the loss of CD4 ϩ T cells, the primary target of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Infected CD4 ϩ T cells undergo fundamental changes that eventually result in cell death and the release of new virus particles (reviewed in references 1 and 2). Following the uptake of virus, the viral genome is reverse transcribed and integrated into the host genome. The host machinery is then used to produce viral transcripts that are either spliced into smaller transcripts that serve as the template for viral proteins or left unspliced to be incorporated into new virus particles. Microarray analyses have shown that infected cells respond to these assaults with gene expression changes in a number of pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle, cholesterol biosynthesis, and inflammation (3) (4) (5) ; reference 1 and references therein).
Many of these cellular responses are also reflected at the level of the host organism. For example, gene expression in the lymph nodes of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected Asian pig-tailed macaques (a model of pathogenic HIV infection) reflects strong and sustained type I interferon responses (6) . A sim-ilar initial interferon response is seen in the natural host, African green monkeys, but it eventually subsides and the infection resolves (6) . Despite intense investigation into the molecular events following infection in these and other studies, fundamental gaps in knowledge still remain. For instance, the extent to which host and viral gene expression respond to each other is still poorly understood. New technologies enabling the measurement of both host and viral RNA may help to address such shortcomings.
In this study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to examine changes in the transcriptome of T cells infected with replication-competent HIV. NGS offers a number of benefits for the study of host-pathogen interactions. Increased sensitivity and accuracy over microarrays allow important events such as the initial host response to viral replication to be studied in greater detail (7) . Also, host and viral RNA transcripts can be assayed simultaneously, rather than on separate technical platforms, allowing greater reproducibility and increased confidence in the results. Finally, because NGS allows total RNA to be assayed, insights are not limited to annotated transcripts or even protein-coding genes.
Indeed, previous work in our group has shown that many noncoding RNA species are differentially expressed in virus-infected cells (8) .
We report here the effects of HIV-1 infection on the expression of polyadenylated RNAs in a CD4 ϩ T cell line. Using NGS, we detected small but significant changes in host gene expression affecting T cell function that coincided with the initiation of viral RNA production at 12 h postinfection (hpi). These changes intensified near peak viral replication at 24 hpi when a multitude of other host processes were disrupted as well. In addition, by using NGS, we observed the dramatic expansion of viral mRNA expression and detected new viral splice events occurring during viral replication and differential expression of noncoding RNA species, including microRNA host genes. These findings provide an unprecedented and comprehensive view into the transcriptomelevel changes that occur within T cells infected with replicating HIV.
In this study, we investigated changes in host and viral transcription occurring in a T lymphoblast-based model of HIV infection. SUP-T1 cells (5 ϫ 10 6 ) were infected in triplicate with HIV-1 strain LAI at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 which resulted in near-complete infection at 24 hours postinfection (hpi). The phenotype of infected cells (including appearance, viability, and the amount of viral mRNA and protein) was used to guide the selection of samples for NGS. At 12 hpi, viral mRNA could be detected in infected cells at appreciable levels (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Few cells expressed the viral antigen p24 Gag, and visually, the cells appeared to be intact. By 24 hpi, high copy numbers of viral mRNA were present (Fig. S1 ). Nearly all cells showed the presence of p24 Gag antigen, syncytia were observed, and nonsyncytial cells had increased in volume. By 28 hpi, the effects of viral infection were more pronounced. The amount of viral RNA peaked (Fig. S1 ), and cell viability decreased. The bulk of cell death occurred between 32 and 48 hpi.
On the basis of these observations, we selected two time points to analyze by NGS: 12 and 24 hpi concurrent with the beginning of viral RNA accumulation and the occurrence of near-peak RNA levels prior to cell death, respectively. We isolated RNA from infected and mock-infected replicate cell samples at these two time points, created cDNA libraries from polyadenylated RNA, and subjected the libraries to analysis by NGS. For each sample, we obtained on average over 21 million 75-nucleotide (nt) reads mapping to either HIV or human genomes. A large number of reads mapped to the viral genome (2.5 to 8 million depending on the time point, see Table S1 in the supplemental material). By 12 hpi, viral reads constituted~18% of the total mapped reads, and by 24 hpi, this proportion increased to~38%. Reads mapping to the viral genome indicated the presence of RNA splicing events. In addition to splicing events involving known splice sites, we also observed evidence of five splicing events involving one or more previously unobserved splice sites (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). We tested the presence of one of these sites (located 3= of the annotated splice acceptor site 2) by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and observed an amplicon size consistent with the usage of the site (Fig. S2A to S2C) .
HIV-1 infection results in a small set of differentially expressed host genes at 12 hpi. To characterize the host response to HIV infection, we mapped the remaining nonviral reads to RefSeq-annotated human gene loci and quantified them as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments). We selected a set of 34 host genes whose expression spanned a range of values and measured the expression levels directly by qPCR (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Measurements by NGS showed a high degree of correlation with qPCR results at both time points (R ϭ 0.97 and R ϭ 0.98 at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively), indicating a close match between the two methods. We then identified specific host genes that were differentially expressed (DE) during infection. Comparing FPKM for each gene in infected cells to time-matched mock-infected cells, we found that a total of 106 genes were DE at 12 hpi (representing all fold changes with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P values of less than 0.05; Table 1 ). By 24 hpi, the number of DE genes had increased to 5,006 representing over 50% of all 9,992 gene loci detected under stringent criteria (Table 1) . Closer examination of these values showed that a large proportion of DE genes occurred with smallmagnitude changes. In particular, 69% (73 of 106) and 49% (2,465 of 5,006) of the expressed genes exhibited 1-to 1.5-fold changes at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively ( Table 1 ). The observed precision of the sequencing-based measurements (Fig. S3 ) supported the use of low-fold change thresholds. Other values for the statistical threshold were also used, and for all but the most stringent thresholds (when fewer than 10 genes were observed to be up-or downregulated at 12 hpi), a similar predominance of small-magnitude changes was observed (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).
Comparing the directionality of change at both time points, we found that nearly all of the DE genes at 12 hpi continued to be regulated in the same manner (i.e., up-or downregulated) at 24 hpi. Specifically, 97 of the 106 DE genes at 12 hpi were also DE at 24 hpi (with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P Ͻ 0.05), and the majority of these (95 of 97) exhibited the same direction of change relative to mock infection, often with increased degree of change (as indicated by more-intense red or green coloration at 24 hpi than at 12 hpi in a heat map of FPKM fold changes, Fig. 1 ). This indicated that regulation coincident with the beginning of viral replication at 12 hpi largely persisted and intensified near peak viral replication at 24 hpi, even for initially low fold changes.
HIV-1 infection impacts core T cell functionality by 12 hpi. We determined the possible impact of these DE genes by analyzing the corresponding annotations (biological processes, molecular functions, and pathways) using the NIH DAVID resource. We found that T cell activation and differentiation were the most overrepresented annotations among DE host genes at 12 hpi overall ( Fig. 2A) . Other annotations associated with DE genes included protein kinase regulation, DNA recombination, and caspase activity regulation ( Fig. 2A ). In addition, several of the DE genes at 12 hpi encoded transcriptional regulators; these genes include EGR1, KLF13, and MYC. Interestingly, four of the nine genes DE at 12 hpi but not at 24 hpi also encoded transcriptional regulators (CREB3L3, HEXIM1, ZNF660, and ZKSCAN4), indicating regulation specific to early viral replication. Seven genes contributed to the overrepresentation of T cell activation among DE genes at 12 hpi (BCL11B, CD1D, EGR1, IKZF1, IRF1, RAG1, and SOX4), six of which were downregulated, indicating a net suppression of T cell activation (as T cell differentiation in Fig. 2 ). Five T cell activation-related DE genes (BCL11B, EGR1, IRF1, IKZF1, and SOX4) encoded transcription factors, some of which had known relevance to HIV infection. For example, the BCL11B gene product binds directly to the HIV-1 sample relative to averaged time-matched mock-infected cell samples. Genes were segregated by the direction of change relative to mock infection at 12 hpi, and hierarchical clustering was done within each directional group. Genes that were not also DE at 24 hpi (purple type) and genes that were also DE at 24 hpi but with changed directionality (gold type) are indicated. Annotations indicate overrepresented categories in DAVID (Fig. 2 ). Matches to top-scoring categories in each DAVID annotation cluster (matching numbers in Fig. 2 ) (solid black squares) and matches to related categories in the same DAVID cluster as the top-scoring category (solid gray squares) are indicated. reg, regulation. long terminal repeat (LTR) and inhibits LTR expression (9) . BCL11B downregulation may therefore allow more efficient HIV-1 replication. Other DE genes related to T cell activation not encoding transcription factors also had known relevance to HIV infection. For example, the CD1D product presents lipid antigens on the surface and is directed by HIV-1 Nef for internalization and degradation (10) . Downregulation of CD1D at the mRNA level would further reduce surface expression and facilitate immune evasion.
We complemented functional analysis in DAVID by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). This method does not rely on the prior determination of DE genes (e.g., by applying a P value threshold) but instead uses a ranked gene list as input and is therefore well suited for identifying annotations among genes with small-magnitude changes in expression (11) . GSEA identified additional genes that were downregulated and contributed to the suppression of T cell activation; these genes include the CD2, CD4, CD7, CD28, and SIT1 genes encoding T cell-specific surface molecules (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). Many of the genes associated with T cell activation in DAVID and GSEA also had roles in other pathways, indicating possible pleiotropic effects (e.g., ADORA2A and RAG1 which also contribute to caspase activity [ Fig. 1]) .
HIV-1 induces large-scale changes in transcription by 24 hpi. By 24 hpi, large-scale changes in the transcriptomes of HIVinfected cells were evident (Table 1 ; see the heatmap in Fig. S5A in the supplemental material). Consistent with the large number of DE genes at 24 hpi, we found that a wide range of biological processes was affected as determined by further analysis using DAVID ( Fig. 2B ; complete listing in Table S3 in the supplemental material). T cell activation and differentiation continued to be overrepresented and were associated with an increased number of DE genes (as lymphocyte differentiation [ Fig. 2B] ). Other fundamental cellular functions associated with DE genes at 24 hpi included DNA metabolism, transcription, mRNA processing and splicing, translation, protein degradation, and cell cycle control (Fig. 2B ). This breadth of functional regulation suggests that HIV-1 infection resulted in the effective transcriptional reprogramming of SUP-T1 cells by 24 hpi.
Suppression of T cell functionality persists and expands at 24 hpi. As was the case at 12 hpi, genes related to T cell activation and differentiation were predominantly downregulated at 24 hpi. All of the T cell activation-related DE genes at 12 hpi continued to exhibit the same direction of change at 24 hpi (Fig. 1 ). Other T cell activation-related genes DE at 24 hpi included CD3D, CD3Q, and RHOH, all of which encode membrane proteins crucial for T cell receptor function. A network depicting known interactions among proteins encoded by T cell activation-related DE genes at 24 hpi showed two highly connected nodes: LCK (lymphocytespecific protein kinase) and TP53 (p53), both of which were strongly downregulated at 24 hpi (Fig. 3A) . Our observed downregulation of TP53 differed from the upregulation observed in previous microarray studies and may indicate a cell type-specific effect (1) . Genes involved in other core T cell functions, such as proliferation, survival, and antigen presentation, were also downregulated at 24 hpi. These genes included CD1D, CD28, CXCR4, TNFRSF4, and TREML2. TOB1 (transducer of ERBB2), a negative regulator of T cell activation, proliferation, and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, showed increased expression and may contribute to the downregulation observed in other genes (data not shown). A connection between TOB1 expression and HIV-1 infection has not previously been mentioned. Overall, the increased number of DE genes related to T cell activation indicated increased suppression of this pathway by 24 hpi.
Ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis and RNA processing. Gene sets related to ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis were the most overrepresented annotations among DE genes at 24 hpi (Fig. 2B) . Ribonucleoproteins contribute to diverse functions within the cell, including microRNA synthesis, ribosomal assembly, and translation (12) . This overlap was reflected at the gene level as well. In particular, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis shared many DE genes at 24 hpi with another top annotation cluster, RNA processing. This set of genes encoding the ribonucleoprotein component of the RNA processing machinery was almost entirely downregulated and included many members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) families. In a network identifying interactions among the proteins encoded by these genes, a number were found to be highly connected (Fig. 3B ). One of these was HNRNPA1 whose gene product regulates the splicing of eukaryotic and viral mRNA (13) . HNRNPA1 and other hnRNP gene products are known to affect the localization of HIV-1 Gag/Pol mRNA, and their overexpression has previously been shown to reduce HIV-1 replication (Fig. 3B) (14) . Other DE genes at 24 hpi related to ribonucleoprotein biogenesis and RNA processing are also known to affect HIV-1 replication directly; these genes include TARDBP (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) whose protein binds the transactivation response (TAR) element of integrated HIV-1 DNA and represses HIV-1 transcription (15) (16) (17) . Downregulation of HNRNPA1, TARDBP, and other related genes may therefore allow more efficient HIV-1 replication in SUP-T1 cells.
RNA transport. The importance of host regulation of RNA fate was underscored by another cluster of gene sets related to RNA transport (Fig. 2B) . Host factors for RNA transport are known to be coopted by HIV-1 to allow the export of unspliced, partially spliced, or fully spliced viral mRNAs out of the nucleus (18) . In particular, the host factors Crm1 (exportin 1) and Ran GTPase are used for the export of unspliced viral mRNA, while the host factor NXF1 (nuclear RNA export factor 1) facilitates the export of fully spliced viral mRNA in a Ran-independent manner (19) . In our data set, we observed no change in the expression of the Crm1-encoding gene XPO1, but several members of the Ran signaling pathway were downregulated, suggesting that the overall export of unspliced viral RNA was suppressed (see Fig. S5B in the supplemental material; data not shown for XPO1). However, in contrast to other RNA transport-related genes, NXF1 and NXF3 were expressed more highly in infected cells, suggesting that HIV infection may have selectively enhanced the export of fully spliced viral RNA (Fig. S5B) .
Limited upregulation of host processes at 24 hpi. Despite the presence of an almost equal number of up-and downregulated genes at 24 hpi, relatively few gene sets (functions, processes, or pathways) were associated with upregulated genes. When up-and downregulated DE genes at 24 hpi were analyzed separately, more annotation clusters were observed among downregulated genes (70 versus 13 among upregulated genes with significance defined by modified Fisher's exact test as P Ͻ 0.05). A similar result was obtained by GSEA (see Fig. S6A and S6B in the supplemental material). These results suggested that upregulated genes were distributed across many gene sets with few occurring in particular functions or pathways. Among the few upregulated pathways were stress-activated/Jnk cascade signaling and ion transport (Fig. S6C) . Consistent with these observations, HIV-1 Nef has been shown to activate Jnk signaling, ultimately activating the caspase cascade and triggering cell death (20) . The triggering of apoptosis at 24 hpi is consistent with our observation that infected cells began to die following the 24-hpi time point.
HIV-1 infection does not trigger innate sensing at 12 hpi. Notably, innate immunity was absent from the processes associated with DE genes at 12 hpi, suggesting that HIV-1 infection impaired T cell activation while evading virus-sensing mechanisms ( Fig. 2A) . With the exception of IRF1, which was downregulated at 12 hpi (Fig. 1) , interferon response factors (IRFs) (IRF2, IRF3, IRF7, and IRF9) showed no significant change in expression at 12 hpi (data not shown). Furthermore, specific IRF targets, including IRF3 target genes IFI35, IFI44, ISG15, and ISG20, were also not differentially expressed at this time point (21, 22) . IRF3 targets were of particular interest, as intact cytoplasmic HIV-1 DNA has been shown to activate IRF3 in CD4 ϩ T cells (23) . Our observed lack of IRF3 target gene expression is consistent with previous observations that replicating HIV-1 suppressed IRF3 activity (24) . We also examined the levels of inflammationrelated genes previously observed to be differentially regulated in HIV infection studies (1): ANXA1, B2M, and CD69 (generally upregulated) and CD53, CD71, IL-13, and IL-16 (generally downregulated). These genes were also either not expressed at detectable levels or unchanged in expression at 12 hpi (data not shown).
Innate immunity and the inflammatory response continued to be absent from the significantly upregulated gene sets at 24 hpi (by GSEA [see Fig. S6A in the supplemental material]). IRF1 was more strongly downregulated at 24 hpi than at 12 hpi, but other IRF genes (IRF2, IRF3, IRF7, and IRF9) continued to show no significant change in expression ( Fig. 1 ; data not shown). In a separate experiment, we confirmed that IRF1 was downregulated at 24 hpi by qPCR (by an average of 44%; data not shown). Other interferon (IFN)-inducible genes were differentially expressed at this time point but in different directions, such as B2M and IFI16 (both downregulated) and IFI30 and ISG20 (both upregulated). This lack of concerted change may have offset the detection of interferon response gene sets as up-or downregulated at 24 hpi by GSEA. Instead, at 24 hpi, the related gene sets of cellular defense and immune response were found to be primarily downregulated (by GSEA [Fig. S6B] ). Several of the downregulated genes associated with these gene sets were also associated with T cell activation; these genes include CD1D, CD2, CD28, RAG1, and TNFRSF4 (Fig. S6D) . Additional immune response-specific genes downregulated at 24 hpi included IL4 and IL7R, suggesting that HIV-1 may have impaired the ability of infected cells to signal other cells or respond to extracellular cues.
By mapping sequencing reads to RefSeq transcript annotation, we also observed changes in the expression of several non-protein-coding RNA species. Specifically, reads mapping to RefSeq transcripts that began with NR were considered noncoding. As before, expression of these transcripts was compared between infected and mock-infected samples. At 12 hpi, only one annotated noncoding RNA (NR_003697 encoding C7orf40) was found to be differentially expressed (Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P Ͻ 0.05). However, by 24 hpi, 305 annotated noncoding RNAs were found to be differentially expressed by the same criterion, with 73 changed by an average of 2-fold or greater (Fig. 4A) . Several classes of noncoding RNAs were represented, including microRNA host genes, hypothetical genes and open reading frames (ORFs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and pseudogenes (Fig. 4A) . DE pseudogenes often matched their protein-coding counterparts in directionality and degree of regulation, which suggests that regulatory regions were maintained and polyadenylated transcripts were produced (data not shown).
We also observed differential expression of four annotated mi-croRNA host genes in infected cells, three of which were downregulated (MIR17HG, MIR142, and MIR621), while the remaining one was upregulated (MIR518F), all with 2-fold or greater changes. The downregulation of MIR17HG (by 2.25-fold) was of particular interest, as MIR17HG encodes a cluster of microRNAs, including miR-17, -18A, -19A, -19B, -20A, and -92 (Fig. 4B) ; in contrast, the other microRNA host genes encode only single microRNAs. Reads mapped to MIR17HG 3= of the mature microRNA sequences, indicating that the postexcised polyadenylated product may have been detected (Fig. 4B) . We also observed a concurrent upregulation of known targets of MIR17HGencoded microRNAs, including PCAF, a host factor required for Tat-induced HIV-1 gene expression (25) .
HIV infection and host noncoding RNA. In this study, we used NGS to measure all of the polyadenylated RNAs in CD4 ϩ T lymphoblasts infected with intact, replication-competent HIV. NGS offers a number of potential benefits to the study of viral infections; among them is the ability to detect non-protein-coding RNAs expressed during infection. In a previous study, we used NGS to detect long noncoding RNAs in the lungs of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-infected mice (8) . Many of these RNAs were found to be differentially expressed, and unique signatures of infection could be identified (8) .
In this study, we also detected several noncoding RNA species in HIV-infected cells that were differentially expressed (DE). In most cases, the functions of these noncoding RNAs and their relevance to infection remains unknown. One noncoding RNA of interest, the microRNA host gene MIR17HG, encoded a cluster of microRNAs and was strongly downregulated during infection. While our method of RNA library preparation precluded direct detection of mature microRNAs, the NGS data set allowed the expression of both regulators and targets of microRNAs to also be observed. For example, we observed a concurrent upregulation of the known target host gene PCAF, a cellular factor required for HIV replication (25) . In contrast to Triboulet et al. (25) who observed that PCAF was upregulated at the protein level but not the mRNA levels in infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MCs), we found that PCAF was upregulated at the mRNA level in infected SUP-T1 cells. This may indicate alternative modes of PCAF regulation in different cell types. In addition, MIR17HGencoded microRNAs have hundreds of other candidate targets in the TargetScan database (26) . Several of these candidates were found to be coexpressed with PCAF in our data set, including KLF3 (unpublished data). KLF3 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor whose precise function is unknown but whose sequence is located proximally to a single-nucleotide polymorphism strongly associated with HIV-1 plasma levels (27) . We also observed differential expression of factors that may have mediated MIR17HG downregulation. For example, O'Donnell et al. (28) found that c-Myc regulates expression of MIR17HG. Consistent with that study, we observed that MYC and MIR17HG were concordantly expressed, as MYC was downregulated at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig. 1) . MYC suppression by HIV-1 may therefore underlie a number of subsequent of transcriptional events.
Early regulation of host transcription factors. We also observed discordance between the large amount of viral RNA present (~20% of total mappable RNA) and the limited amount of altered host gene expression at 12 hpi (~1% of detectable gene loci). That is, despite the use of host machinery and the presence of foreign mRNA, host transcription remained relatively unchanged. This result suggests that at 12 hpi, viral transcription occurred on top of largely undisturbed transcription of host genes. The host genes that we detected as differentially expressed at 12 hpi showed that T cell activation and differentiation were suppressed in in- fected cells, likely via the downregulation of T cell activationspecific transcription factors (BCL11B, IRF1, IKZF1, and SOX4) . The regulation of these and transcription factors specific for other functions (e.g., EGR1, KLF13, and MYC) may explain how HIV initiated replication with minimal disruption to host gene expression at 12 hpi but elicited larger-scale changes later in infection.
The suppression of T cell activation that we observed was consistent with previous studies on the response of T cells to infection by chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)-tropic versus chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5)-tropic HIV-1 strains (29) (30) (31) . For example, Sirois et al. (31) found that key T cell activation-related genes, including LCK, were downregulated at 24 hpi by a CXCR4-tropic strain, whereas these same genes were upregulated by a CCR5-tropic strain. Our study utilized the CXCR4-tropic strain LAI, and it would be interesting to generate NGS data for a CCR5-tropic virus for comparison. Interestingly, our observations of small-magnitude differences in expression were consistent with those of Sirois et al. (31) , who found the expression of T cell activation-related genes to be changed by 0.5fold or less using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).
Large-scale disruptions to host transcription near peak viral replication. By 24 hpi, extensive reprogramming of the host transcriptome affecting a multitude of pathways had occurred. Remarkably, these large-scale changes occurred without concerted upregulation of innate immunity at the gene set level, suggesting that HIV-1 evaded viral sensing mechanisms. By this time point, the most affected pathways related to RNA fate determination, including RNA processing. While HIV-related RNA processing has been studied intensively, the contribution of most host factors remains incompletely defined (32) . Modulation of this pathway by the virus may allow the proportion of unspliced, partially spliced, and fully spliced HIV RNA to be adjusted depending on the stage of the HIV life cycle. Our finding that over 150 genes related to RNA processing were differentially expressed suggests that HIV-1 infection results in a more complete modulation of RNA processing than previously identified (5, 33) . However, our observed downregulation of RNA processing was consistent with results from an earlier study using NGS to investigate changes in CD4 ϩ T lymphoblasts infected with an HIV-based, nonreplication-competent vector at 24 hpi (34) . Altered regulation of this and other pathways has been observed using microarrays as well, although in general, we observed changes in greater numbers of genes affecting these pathways using NGS (3, 5, 33, 35, 36) .
Finally, we compared our results from NGS to other types of data available regarding HIV-infected cells, including proteinprotein interaction (PPI) data and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screens. In an analysis of HIV-related PPI data, van Dijk et al. (37) identified sets of human proteins highly connected to host and viral proteins (37) . Several proteins related to T cell activation were identified as highly connected; these proteins included CD4, CXCR4, and LCK (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). Downregulation of these members, as we observed, would therefore potentially affect the functions of many other proteins as well. Together, these data emphasize the high degree to which HIV-1 suppressed this pathway. In addition, many of the pathways associated with DE genes were identified as essential for HIV-1 replication in a recent meta-analysis of siRNA-based screen data (38) . These pathways included DNA binding, RNA splicing, RNA export, nuclear transport, and protein complex assembly (Table S3) . While the siRNA data suggest that HIV-1 ini-tially requires these pathways to be active to establish an infection, our data suggest that HIV-1 also later suppresses and inactivates these pathways during active replication.
In conclusion, using NGS, we have reported a number of unique findings in HIV-infected cells: the direct measurement of viral and host RNA, the detection of small changes in the abundance of mRNA transcripts, the identification of novel viral RNA splice events, and the assay of multiple forms of noncoding RNAs, including insights into the regulation of microRNAs. These observations give additional insights into the panoply of changes that occur in host cells infected with HIV and provide the groundwork for using new sequencing technologies in future studies investigating the host response to viral infection.
SUP-T1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1942) and propagated in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and GlutaMAX-I. HIV-1 LAI strain (catalog no. 2522) was obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Germantown, MD) and propagated in SUP-T1 cells. U373-MAGI-CXCR4 CEM cells were obtained from M. Emerman through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, and the virus titer in these cells was measured by the protocol of Deminie and Emerman (39) . Typical titers reached 10 7 infectious units per ml. Infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 and performed in triplicate. Mock-infected samples received SUP-T1 cell conditioned medium and were also performed in triplicate. The infectious dose was optimized to achieve 100% infected cells at 24 hpi with 50% cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. Infected cells were visualized by immunofluorescence assay with rabbit HIV-1 SF2 p24 antiserum kindly provided by BioMolecular Technologies through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.
RNA preparation and next-generation sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from 5 ϫ 10 6 cells per sample using a mirVana kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX), and the quality and concentration of the RNA were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples were submitted for sequencing to IlluminaFastTrack Sequencing Services (Hayward, CA). cDNA libraries were generated using Illumina mRNA-SEQ kit. The quality and concentration of these libraries were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The libraries were clonally amplified on a cluster generation station using Illumina version 4 cluster generation reagents to achieve a target density of approximately 300,000 (300K)/mm 2 in a single channel of a flow cell. The resulting libraries were then sequenced on a Genome Analyzer IIx using Illumina version 4.0 sequencing reagents which generated single reads of 75 nucleotides (nt).

Read mapping and transcript quantification. We mapped the 75-nt reads to human ribosomal sequences using the short-read aligner software Bowtie to remove potential rRNA sequences (40) . We then mapped the remaining unmapped reads to the HIV genome (GenBank accession no. K02013) using the gapped aligner software TopHat, which predicts HIV splicing junctions and maps intron-spanning reads to known splicing junctions (41) . To quantify transcript expression, we mapped all reads that remained unmapped to the human reference genome (hg19, build GRCh37, downloaded from UCSC genome browser, http://genome.ucsc .edu) using the gapped aligner software TopHat. RefSeq transcript annotations were supplied to facilitate the mapping of reads spanning known splicing junctions. On the basis of these human genome mapping results, we then estimated the levels of expression at both the transcript and locus levels for RefSeq-annotated genes using the transcript assembly software Cufflinks (42) . Read sequences that mapped to more than one genomic location were excluded from expression quantification. For visualization, BAM files were generated using TopHat and SAMtools (43) and displayed using the UCSC Genome Browser.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Splice site variant detection and testing. The positions of known viral splice sites were found in the literature (44) , and the corresponding sequences were identified in strain pNL4-3 (GenBank accession no. AF003887). Based on sequence identity to strain LAI, a list of known LAI-specific splice sites was generated and compared to the NGS TopHat output. Splice patterns involving splice sites SD 1 and SA 2/2* were tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using primers PSK027F (5= CAGGGACTTG AAAGCGAAAG 3=; locations 193 to 212 in HIVBRUCG accession no. K02013) and PSK027R (5= TGGGGCTTGTTCCATCTATC 3=; locations 5136 to 5155).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quantitative reverse transcription (RT-PCR). RNA was reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The resulting cDNA samples were diluted 50ϫ. ABI TaqMan assays were run for each sample in triplicate (see Fig. S3C in the supplemental material). Relative expression was calculated using the ⌬⌬C T method with averaged ⌬C T values (where C T stands for threshold cycle) for the OAZ1 gene as a calibrator, as the expression of OAZ1 did not significantly change between 12 and 24 hpi in the NGS data. Intracellular viral RNA load was quantified as previously described (45) . Relative change of IRF1 was determined by qPCR using primers PSK1 (forward primer [5= TCTG GCTTTTTCCTCTGAGC 3=] and reverse primer [5= ATGCTTTTCTGG GGTCACTG 3=]).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Differential expression analysis. To compare transcript expression across different conditions, we first normalized transcript abundances by the following methodology. Transcript abundance was quantified as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments) values estimated by Cufflinks. We chose one sample arbitrarily as a reference. Distributions of log 2 -transformed FPKM values between the reference and remaining samples were compared by quantile-quantile plots. We determined the scaling factor for each sample as the median difference of the corresponding quantile values of the sample and reference. Only genes/transcripts with raw FPKM values of Ն1 in all samples were considered in the estimation of scaling factors. We retained those genes/transcripts with nonzero FPKM values in 100% of the samples of at least one biological condition (our detection criterion). An offset of 1 was added to all normalized values to facilitate the comparisons involving one or more FPKM values of zero and to reduce the variability of the log ratios for low expression values. Transcripts were mapped to RefSeq gene loci, resulting in 9,992 loci with detectable reads. The data are available at http://www .viromics.washington.edu or upon request. The normalized expression data were analyzed for differential expression by using linear model methods as implemented in the R package limma (46) . P values were derived from linear model-based t tests between infected and time-matched mock-infected samples. Unless otherwise noted, we defined differential expression by Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P values of less than 0.05 based on the assumption that a false discovery rate of 5% provided an acceptable balance of false-positive control and statistical power. Fold changes (FC) were derived from comparing the means of these groups, and multiple groupings of fold changes were used (1.0 to 1.5 FC, 1.5 to 2.0 FC, and 2.0ϩ FC) based on previous observed fold change ranges observed in high-throughput and in particular NGS data in virus-infected systems (8) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DAVID and GSEA analyses. To identify annotations among DE genes, we used the NIH DAVID resource (47, 48) . Default settings were used in DAVID with GO_BP_FAT, GO_CC_FAT, GO_MP_FAT, BIO-CARTA, and KEGG_PATHWAY gene set annotations. Complementary analysis was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (11) . Default settings were used in GSEA with Gene Ontology (GO) categories (c5.all.v2.5 gene sets) and Biocarta and KEGG pathways (c2.all.v2.5 gene sets) and 5,000 gene set-based permutations. Leading-edge analysis was performed within GSEA to derive genes for hierarchically clustering upand downregulated gene sets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interactions between DE genes were identified using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). Networks were generated within IPA based on direct, literature-curated interactions. Subsets of genes were selected for input into IPA based on DE gene overlaps with DAVID annotation clusters. Heat maps were generated using the R package gplots. Comparisons to published networks of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data were made using Cytoscape (49) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

166,5072f11488276a2dc8171394942364d59373c743,"Peptides are secreted by different cell types and are trendy therapeutic agents that have attracted attention for the treatment of several diseases such as infections. Antimicrobial peptides exert various mechanisms such as changing cell membrane permeability which leads to inhibition or death of bacterial cells. mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are key to produce antimicrobial peptides and to inhibit the growth of pathogens. These cells have been shown to be capable of producing antimicrobial peptides upon exposure to different bacteria. As a result, antimicrobial peptides can be considered as novel agents for the treatment of infectious diseases. The purpose of this review was to investigate the targets and mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides secreted by MSCs.","Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections through either inhibiting or killing the target bacteria. The first antibiotic was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, called penicillin and saved the lives of millions of people. However, the discovery of penicillin as a modern medication was preceded by the management of microbial infections in Egypt, Greece and ancient China [1] . Shortly after the discovery of penicillin, the bacterial resistance to this antibiotic became one of the challenges in the treatment of bacterial infections. Therefore, new generation of beta-lactam antibiotics was developed to overcome antibiotic resistance and to treat bacterial infections. However, the first case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reported in England in 1962 [2, 3] . The production and discovery of new antibiotics continue to this day and new antibiotics are marketed to counteract the drug resistance problem. Yet, the point should be raised that one day antibiotics can no longer affect bacteria and will no longer be able to control bacterial infections. Consequently, in recent years, researchers have devised other means to treat bacterial infections. One of such approaches is the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) or ""peptide antibiotics"" to kill pathogenic bacteria and to treat bacterial infections [4] . Over the past decades, antimicrobial peptides (peptide antibiotics) have been shown to be effective in innate immunity of various species, such as plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. The intrinsic immune system is the first line of defense against the attack of microorganisms, among which the antimicrobial peptide molecules are the most important ones. The cathelicidin family is important antimicrobial agents in mammals [5, 6] . These peptides are mainly stored in lysosomes of macrophages (MQ) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) [7] . Cathelicidins have been isolated from many cell types including neutrophils to coordinate the immune system, but have been found in other immune cells such as epithelial cells and macrophages and have been shown to combat against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Cathelicidins have a variety of sizes (12-80 amino acids) and also have a wide range of structures [8] . The molecular mechanism of antimicrobial peptides has been investigated [9] . Stem cells have been the focus of research because they have shown good potential in the field of therapy [10] . One of the features of the stem cells referred to in this review is antimicrobial activity of mesenchymal stem cells that perform this action through antimicrobial peptides such as ll-37, Hepcidin and β-Defensin-2 [11] . The purpose of this study is to briefly review mesenchymal stem cells and antimicrobial peptides and how these peptides function.
In recent years, stem cells have been widely used in the treatment of many diseases. One of the most important stem cells is mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have been shown to play a role in regulating the immune system and suppressing deleterious properties. MSCs have the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as cartilage, bone, muscle and fat. MSCs have been obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord, blood, placenta, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Recent studies have found that MSCs play an important role in the treatment of diseases, including infections, by producing antimicrobial peptides [12, 13, 14] .
Cathelicidin is a carrier that has a wide range of functional molecules (i.e. cysteine or non-cysteine). The presence of this peptide has been proven in cattle, rabbits, pigs and humans [15] .
Due to the unique characteristics of antimicrobial peptides, these peptides are one of the main candidates in the treatment of bacterial diseases and are effective on antibiotic resistant strains and even cancer cells. These properties include rapid killing and a wide range of activity that perform antimicrobial action by pore-forming the cell membrane [16] . But these peptides can also be toxic to the cells of the body, so using peptides with a wide range of lethality and low side effects can help cure bacterial infections [17] .
In 1995, Agerberth et al [18] based on the protected section of cathepsin, derived human bone marrow cDNA clones from an unspecified antibacterial peptide named FA-LL-37. The peptide constitutes of 39 Monocyte [28] amino acids whose N-terminal is FALL and the name of the peptide was coined for FALL. The helical structure of this peptide was investigated in a saline environment containing vitamin E upon synthesis and antibacterial activity was investigated [9] . The peptide is specifically secreted in the secondary granules of neutrophils. It is also produced by many types of cells, including macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, epithelial cells of the skin, airways, eyes and intestinal tract. Also, the expression of the peptide LL-37 is controlled by inflammatory pathways, similar to the pathway of vitamin D [19] . In addition to antimicrobial activity, this peptide has immunomodulatory roles. For example, exposure to 10 μg/ml of LL-37 peptide during a monocyte-macrophage differentiation leads to a positive inflammatory response, resulting in a decrease in the level of interleukin 10 and an adjustment of 12p40. In addition, the peptide LL-37 leads to the phenotype M1, which suggests that this peptide has an important role in the development of macrophages and cytokine production [20] .
Other chemical properties of LL-37 is as follows: migration of neutrophils and eosinophils through the formyl-peptide receptor; transactivation of the epidermis growth factors by the peptide causes the migration of keratinocytes, which results in wound healing; MCP-1CCL-2 is a monocyte extraction factor that is secreted by LL-37 after stimulation. In addition, transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) released from the epithelial cells of the intestine after exposure to LL-37 has an effect on the migration of epithelial cells and improved response. It is concluded that the peptide LL-37 is spread at the site of the infection, causing inflammatory response and wound healing [20, 21, 22] . LL-37 peptide has different activities, all of which lead to antimicrobial activity. These include regeneration and angiogenesis, which is done by the formyl-peptide receptor-like 1 expressed on the endothelial cells [23] . Chemotaxis is also one of the activities of this peptide, which causes the migration of mast cells to the environment [24] . In addition, degranulation of mast cells and the release of inflammatory mediators takes place by the LL-37 peptide [25] . LL-37 peptide, on the other hand, induces many cytokines and induces the production of antibodies [26] . LL-37 peptide from primary human keratinocytes and human keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells protect from apoptosis [27] . The results have shown that fluid membrane-associated peptides increases the plasma membrane of the subcutaneous glandular cells [28] . This peptide also considered as an endotoxin, which inhibits the responses of inflammatory proteins to the bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in human cells (Fig. 1) [29].
This peptide performs its actions by connecting to cell receptors ( Table 1) . As previously mentioned, LL-37 is actively involved in physiological responses to eukaryotic cells, which is essentially an antimicrobial peptide. This peptide is effective in people whose immune system is low, so that through transactivation of EGFR and angiogenesis by FPRL1 receptor and chemotaxis causes cell migration [30] .
In addition, the expression of transgenic LL-37 leads to a significant increase in proliferation of corpuscular cells in HaCaT and HEK 293 [33] .
With the presence of lymph node metastases in estrogen-receptor positive or ER positive cancer, clinical trials have shown an increase in Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB 2 ) signaling, indicating an increase in peptide LL-37 activity, which plays an important role in the treatment of cancer [34] .
This peptide also interacts with P 2 X7 purinoceptor, which is expressed mainly in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and stimulates and releases cytokine IL-1β in human gingival fibroblasts (Fig. 2) [35]). 
Another antimicrobial peptide produced by MSCs is called hepcidin, which plays an important role in the clearance of pathogens. This antimicrobial peptide is rich in cysteine, the precursor of which is secreted by the liver (Fig. 3) . Hepcidin is present in three forms of prehormone (84 amino acids), prohormone (60 amino acids) and hormones (25 amino acids) [36] . This peptide was discovered in 2000 and was called LEAP 1, but after a while due to presence in the liver, the peptide was named ""hepcidin"". This peptide is effective on a wide range of fungi, bacteria and viruses. One of the most important effects of hepcidin in the body is the regulation of iron hemostasis. This peptide prevents iron absorption from the small intestine and releases iron from reticuloendothelial cells. In infectious diseases, macrophages and bacteria compete to absorb iron [37] . Macrophages interfere with the absorption of iron by bacteria. Eventually, the pathogen does not grow and replenish. Factors that cause hepcidin production are increased in bone marrow and anemia. Other factors that increase the production of hepcidin are iron accumulation and inflammation [38] .
Hepcidin is effective on iron transfer from macrophages. In the presence of hepcidin, ferritin is transmitted into the macrophage and is destroyed by lysosomes, resulting in storage of iron inside the cell. In low concentrations of hepcidin, ferritin is present in the cell membrane, allowing the release of iron. After leaving the cell, iron oxide is rapidly oxidized by ceruloplasmin, a copper-rich ferroxidase and converted into ferric iron and then bound to transferrin [39] .
Hepcidin is bound to plasma alpha-2 macroglobulin (alpha 2M). Evidence suggests that other cells may express the hepcidin mRNA at a much lower level than the hepatocytes; the biological significance of the extra hepatic production of hepcidin remains uncertain. Plasma hepcidin is freely treated through glomeruli and in animals with normal kidney activity it quickly passes through the urine. In addition, a part of hepcidin is cleansed through degradation along with ferritin [40] (Fig. 4 ).
Cysteine-rich cationic proteins are found in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, which range from 18 to 145 amino acids [41] . The role of these peptides is to defend the host against bacteria, fungi and viruses. These peptides play a role in destroying the bacterial cell membrane. Defensins were discovered for the first time in 1980. The basic genes produced by these peptides are highly polymorphic. Generally, defensins are classified in three main groups of alpha, beta and theta, each of which has different genetic symbols and is produced from different cells [42] , as shown in Table 2 .
In immature individuals, defensins (present in breast milk) play a very important role in protecting the disease due to the weak immune system. The Defensin is produced by epithelial cells and leukocytes, as indicated in Table 2 . Alpha defensin exists only in mammals, while beta defensin exists in many vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, but theta Table 2 Defensin types [43, 44, 45] . Defensin-5 alpha 6
Defensin-6 β -Defensin β 1 β-Defensin 1 Secreted by leukocytes and epithelial cells of many kinds.
Have been found only in the leukocytes of the rhesus macaque and the olive baboon, Papio anubis, being vestigial in humans and other primates. Fig. 5 . MSCs produce microbial peptides including hepcidin, LL-37 and β-defensin to fight against bacteria. As shown in the figure above, the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria, while the effect of β-defensin peptide on the bacteria of Escherichia coli has been proven [14] . defensin has been found in several species of ancient monkeys, but not in humans and other primates. The important point is that the mRNA manages to denote the theta defensin, but the mutations cause the end codon to stop peptide production. One of the key characteristics of defensins is their antimicrobial activity, which is active against Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and viruses [46] .
In addition to antimicrobial activity, defensin exerts other functions that includes chemical absorption for monocytes, cytokines production by monocytes and epithelial cells, angiogenesis activity and response to hormones. Antimicrobial effect on Gram-positives is different from Gram-negative bacteria. The reason is that, first, the cell wall structure of Gram-positive bacteria is different from Gram-negatives (the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is rich in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which has a negative charge, while in Gram-positive bacteria the cell wall have teichoic acids (TA) with less negative charge. Secondly, the peptidoglycan layer is thick in Gram-positive bacteria and the formation of pores by defensin on the surface of the Gram-positive cells requires more time. Therefore, defensin has weaker anti-microbial activity in Gram-positive bacteria [46] .
Defensin functions on the bacterial cells via the L-arginine cationic chain that are attached by electrostatic absorption to the membrane's anionic structure, then defensin is introduced into the membrane by using the electromotive force of the membrane, creating channels inside the membrane. Ultimately, materials that are surrounded by membranes are leaked outside or inside the cell and causes bacterial cell lysis [46] .
Attempts to design novel treatment strategies as alternatives for the current treatment of diseases such as sepsis, bacteremia, bloodstream infections and other bacterial infections have become a major challenge. One of the most important treatments used to kill pathogenic bacteria is the use of antibiotics, which has some disadvantages in addition to its benefits. Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest treatment problems with antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is on the rise and the number of resistant are constantly circulating in the communities and it can be said that it will not last long as antibiotics will no longer be effective against bacteria [47, 48] . An emerging approach to treat infections is the use of antimicrobial peptides produced from various cells, including MSCs. Research has shown that MSCs have antimicrobial properties and this property is related to the production of antimicrobial peptides (Fig. 5 ) [14] .
There are several barriers to using stem cells in treatment, such as the immune response to stem cells that can reduce the function of these cells, as well as their use may cause infection, poisoning, cancer and even death [49] . As a result, it is better to use mesenchymal stem cells in treatment if the treatments that have been used so far are no longer effective. On the other hand, the use of mesenchymal stem cells as a treatment has many benefits, one of which is the lack of damage that is usually caused by chemical treatments on the body. The use of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of bacterial infections can reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance [50] .
In conclusion, MSCs are very capable of eliminating bacterial infections. The use of these cells and their antimicrobial products can be a potential alternative to current treatments, while bacterial resistance can be avoided.

An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was distributed among HCWs and trainees who worked or volunteered at the Hajj 2015-2017 through their line managers, or by visiting their hospitals and healthcare centres in Makkah and Mina. Overseas HCWs who accompanied the pilgrims or those who work in foreign Hajj medical missions were excluded. Pearson's χ 2 test was used to compare categorical variables and odds ratio (OR) was calculated by ""risk estimate"" statistics along with 95% confidence interval (95%CI).
A total of 138 respondents aged 20 to 59 (median 25.6) years with a male to female ratio of 2.5:1 participated in the survey. Only 11.6% (16/138) participants reported receiving all three vaccines, 15.2% (21/138) did not receive any vaccine, 76.1% (105/138) received meningococcal, 68.1% (94/138) influenza and 13.8% (19/138) pneumococcal vaccine. Females were more likely to receive a vaccine than males (OR 3.6, 95%CI: 1.0-12.7, P < 0.05). Willingness to follow health authority's recommendation was the main reason for receipt of vaccine (78.8%) while believing that they were up-to-date with vaccination (39.8%) was the prime reason for non-receipt.
Some HCWs at Hajj miss out the compulsory and highly recommended vaccines; lack of awareness is a key barrier and authority's advice is an important motivator. Health education followed by stringent measures may be required to improve their vaccination rate.","Hajj is the largest annual mass gathering event that takes place in designated areas in Makkah, Saudi Arabia where two to three million people assemble from all corners of the world on specific dates of the last month of the lunar calendar. Establishing a healthy environment during Hajj is one of the strategic objectives of the host country [1, 2] . Intense congestion during Hajj along with compromised hygiene, shared accommodation and air pollution amplify the risk of meningococcal and other air-borne diseases including influenza and pneumonia [3] .
In the last few decades, meningococcal outbreaks from Hajj gathering have been a major global public health concern [4] [5] [6] . Two major intercontinental outbreaks of meningococcal disease occurred during Hajj seasons of 1987 (caused by serogroup A) and again during 2000-01 seasons (caused by serogroup W) affected thousands of individuals globally [6] [7] [8] [9] . Currently, it is compulsory for anyone, including health care workers (HCWs) who are going to attend congregation, serve pilgrims or reside in Hajj zones whether as pilgrims or seasonal workers to be vaccinated with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (against serogroups A, C, W and Y) [3] .
Lately seasonal influenza and pneumonia have been major morbidities among Hajj pilgrims [10] [11] [12] .
More than 90% of pilgrims develop at least one respiratory symptom while at Hajj [13] . Respiratory viruses, especially influenza, are the most common causes of acute respiratory infections among pilgrims [10, [14] [15] [16] .
The attack rate of influenza among pilgrims ranges from 4% to 15% [17, 18] . Currently, influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for Hajj pilgrims and their carers, especially for individuals at higher risk of severe influenza [19] . Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care units, and severe sepsis and septic shock during Hajj [12, [20] [21] [22] . The point prevalence of pneumonia has risen substantially during Hajj, as it reached up to 340/100000 pilgrims among Iranian in 2005 compared to 4.8/100000 reported in 1986 [23] [24] [25] .
Studies revealed an increase of the pneumococcal nasal carriage up to 2.7-fold before and after Hajj [26, 27] . The Saudi Thoracic Society and independent experts also recommend pneumococcal vaccines especially for those at higher risk of complications [28, 29] . An estimated 70000 emergency room visits and 12000 hospitalisations occur during a typical Hajj season, and a physician needs to see over 600 patients and a nurse looks after about 400 patients per day during Hajj [30] . To cater for such a large number of pilgrims each year about 30000 HCWs are mobilised from across Saudi Arabia to the Hajj sites in Makkah and Madinah; also, many trainee medics wilfully volunteer at Hajj.
Unvaccinated personnel who have contact with patients put themselves, their colleagues and patients at risk of preventable diseases. Coexistence of Hajj setting as well as excessive workload environment may double these risks. For instance, Al-Asmary et al [31] found that a quarter of HCW in Hajj medical admission developed acute respiratory infections, contact with pilgrims was a significant risk factor for acquisition of this infection. Thus, ensuring vaccination of HCWs at Hajj is very important to protect themselves and their patients. These include mandatory meningococcal vaccine, and highly recommended influenza vaccine; both are funded for HCWs who care for Hajj pilgrims. Yet, the uptake of these vaccines among HCWs at Hajj has been suboptimal [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , there is no data on pneumococcal vaccine uptake among HCWs at Hajj. In previous reports non-availability of vaccine and lack of time were key barriers to vaccination among HCWs at Hajj [34, 35] , however the latest data are not known, and no data on facilitators of vaccination.
To this end, we have conducted a survey to evaluate the uptake of meningococcal, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines among HCWs at Hajj, and explored the key factors that affected vaccine uptake including facilitators of vaccination.
An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was conducted among HCWs and trainees who were employed in Saudi Arabia and worked or volunteered during the Hajj 2015-2017. The survey was distributed among HCWs, including trainees and students who volunteered at Hajj, through their line managers, or by visiting their hospitals and healthcare centres in Makkah and Mina, a major Hajj spot at the outskirt of Makkah. The survey link was sent to the potential participants via short message service, WhatsApp Messenger or email. Overseas HCWs who accompanied the pilgrims or those who work in foreign Hajj medical missions were excluded. Following invitation, the potential respondents acknowledged their acceptance to participate electronically before starting to fill the e-form. The questionnaire included questions about their demographics such as age, gender, current employment, presence or absence of chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, bronchial asthma, other lung or heart diseases, and malignancies. Any participant reporting at least one of these underlying medical conditions and/or aged ≥ 65 years was considered ""at increased risk"". The questionnaire then asked if the HCWs received meningococcal, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines as a part of their preparation for secondment at Hajj. It also asked about the reasons for receipt or non-receipt of vaccines. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 25 .0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). Pearson's χ 2 test was used to compare categorical variables and ""risk estimate"" statistics was used to calculate odds ratio (OR). A two-tailed P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
This study was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of King Abdullah Medical City, Saudi Arabia (Ref: . Respondents' completion of the survey was considered as their implied consent, so signed informed consent was not obtained, and no identifiable personal data were collected.
A total of 138 respondents participated in the survey. Among participants who declared their age (3 did not declare age) the age ranged from 20 to 59 (median 25.6) years with a male to female ratio of 2.5:1. Students/trainee HCWs formed the largest group (41%) followed by nurses (28%) and physicians (16%). Eight per cent (n = 11) respondents were ""at increased risk"" either because of age or having a pre-existing medical condition. Sixty six per cent (91/138) of the respondents attended Hajj at least once in the past (Table 1) .
Of all respondents, 11.6% (16/138) reported receiving all three (meningococcal, influenza, pneumococcal) vaccines, 15.2% (21/138) did not receive any of the vaccines, another 2.9% (4/138) were unsure of their vaccination status. Females were more likely to receive a vaccine than males [OR 3.6, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): (1.0-12.7), P < 0.05].
As The reasons for receipt and non-receipt of vaccines are listed in Figures 1 and 2 respectively, willingness to follow health authority's recommendation was the main reason for receipt of vaccine (78.8%) while believing that they were up-to-date with vaccination and hence did not need any more vaccines (39.8%), and unawareness of Hajj vaccines (31.9%) were the prime reasons for non-receipt.
This survey aimed to assess the uptake of the three (meningococcal, influenza, pneumococcal) vaccines among HCWs, a key working group during Hajj, and to explore the important barriers and facilitators. The key findings of this study are that some HCWs at Hajj, mostly males, failed to receive the key Hajj vaccines including the compulsory meningococcal vaccine. Health authority's recommendation was the main motivator. Lack of awareness about vaccines and a false perception that the respondents were up-to-date with all vaccinations were the two single most important barriers.
Despite the historical importance of meningococcal disease and mandatory requirement of vaccination against it for attending Hajj, at least 9% HCWs and trainees failed to receive the freely available compulsory meningococcal vaccine. In fact, such a poor vaccine uptake was reported in surveys conducted among HCWs in 2003, 2009 and 2014 with the respective uptake of 82.4%, 67.1% and 69.1% [32, 33, 35] . Non vaccination against a fatal disease among HCWs, who often provide intensive medical care to ill pilgrims, is a grave concern.
Meningococcal vaccination is a visa requirement for international pilgrims, so the vaccine coverage is essentially 100% [36, 37] , however domestic pilgrims and 
HCWs evade such requirement leading to suboptimal vaccination rate as low as 64% among domestic pilgrims compared to 100% vaccination rate among UK pilgrims [37] . However, achieving optimum vaccination by the appropriate vaccine is still challenge even among the overseas pilgrims. For instance, a minority of Nigerian pilgrims were found to be vaccinated with the monovalent meningococcal serogroup A vaccine whereas the policy was to use the quadrivalent ACWY vaccine [38] . Occasional use of fake vaccination certificate was another challenge in some countries [39] . Influenza vaccination of HCWs during Hajj is highly recommended [19] , yet 29% participants in this study reported not receiving it before attending Hajj. Four previous studies evaluated the coverage of influenza vaccination among HCWs in Hajj with the uptake ranged from as low as 5.9% in 2003, to 61.6% in 2005, 50.9% in 2009 and 52.7% in 2013-15 [31] [32] [33] 40] . Even the uptake of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic vaccine remained between 22% and 47% [33, 34] . The uptake rate in non-Hajj setting is almost similar, ranging from 21% to 51% in several surveys conducted between 2003 and 2014 [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] , and among Saudi medical students it reached 57.2% in 2017 [46] . Furthermore, a strong vaccine hesitancy was revealed in a recent study where 13% of HCWs reported not taking influenza vaccine in the past, and would not receive it in the future [47] .
Although recent increase in influenza vaccination rate is promising, the suboptimal uptake in this important occupational group, who are expected to be vaccinated even when not serving at Hajj, is a concern. Recently, Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MoH) have made the Basic Infection Control Skills License (BICSL), mandatory for all HCWs. BICSL licensure includes, among others, receiving meningococcal and influenza vaccines and the measure is expected to enhance the coverage of both vaccines among HCWs.
The lower uptake rate of meningococcal and influenza vaccines among males could be due to their lower preventative sense, notably towards preemptive and pre-travel advices, or could be a chance finding seeing that most of the survey participants were male [48] . A Dutch study involving Hajj pilgrims showed that being a female was an independent predictor for accepting dTP vaccine [49] . Although no official recommendation for routine pneumococcal vaccination for HCWs exists, experts have recommended it for Hajj attendees considered to be ""at increased risk"" [28, 29] . Our findings showed suboptimal vaccination rate (13.8%) even among ""at increased risk"" group (27.3%). Previously, a much lower vaccination rate (1.5%) was reported among ""at increased risk"" international pilgrims, however, much higher uptake (29%-48%) among ""at increased risk"" pilgrims from developed countries is reported [50] . Promisingly, the main reason for receipt of vaccines was to follow the health authority's recommendation but there were several key misperceptions. A false belief among HCWs that they were up-to-date with their vaccinations and that they did not need any more vaccines for Hajj attendance was a key barrier. This belief may have stemmed from their lack of awareness about the requirement and the availability of Hajj vaccines, and their presumption that just for joining the congregation they may not need the vaccinations since they were local residents. HCWs' reliance on other preventive measures and their claimed ability to know how to ward off an infection without vaccination were other important barriers. Some of these barriers were previously reported among HCWs serving at Hajj [34, 35] . Workplace vaccination campaigns could make a difference and was found to be successful in Saudi Arabia. For instance, assigning a dedicated nurse in each department to conduct vaccinations during an annual in-hospital campaign increased staff influenza vaccination up to three folds at a tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia (from 29% to 77%, 81% and 67%) [45] . The strength of this survey is that it gives a very quick snapshot about Hajj HCWs' uptake of three vaccines: a mandatory vaccine (meningococcal), a highly desirable vaccine (influenza), and an optional vaccine (pneumococcal), and for the first time provides insight on motivators of vaccination. However, this study is fraught with limitations. Small sample size is a key limitation of this survey, HCWs are too busy to complete a survey form, hence like most other surveys involving HCWs at Hajj it has a small sample size. Also, the data are self-reported, and we had no way to validate their vaccination histories but since HCWs are expected to have sufficient health literacy the information are considered to be reliable. The survey did not distinguish between polysaccharide and conjugate meningococcal vaccines, and both vaccines were used in Saudi Arabia during the survey period. Furthermore, the questionnaire did not distinguish those who received the meningococcal vaccine in the previous years versus the current year. Finally, since the survey was online and because we wanted to make it simple for the busy HCWs, we did not ask about reasons for receipt or nonreceipt of individual vaccines, so the responses received could be meant for any one or all the three vaccines.
In conclusion, this survey shows that many HCWs at Hajj miss out the compulsory and highly recommended vaccines; lack of awareness is a key barrier and authority's advice is an important motivator. Health education followed by stringent measures may be required to improve their vaccination rate. Evaluation of the role of on-going measures such as workplace vaccination campaigns and the BICSL is needed to better understand the uptake of vaccination among HCWs at Hajj.
In the last few decades, meningococcal outbreaks from Hajj gathering have been a major global public health concern. It is now compulsory for anyone who is going to attend Hajj congregation or serve the pilgrims to be vaccinated with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (against serogroups A, C, W and Y). Seasonal influenza vaccine is also highly advised for all Hajj attendees, and pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for pilgrims with co-morbidities.
The uptake of these vaccines among health care workers (HCWs) at Hajj has been suboptimal and there is no data on pneumococcal vaccine uptake. In previous reports non-availability of vaccine and lack of time were key barriers to vaccination among HCWs at Hajj, however there is no data on facilitators of vaccination.
The objectives are to evaluate the uptake of meningococcal, influenza, pneumococcal vaccines among HCWs who serve at Hajj, and to explore the key factors, including facilitators, affecting their vaccination rate.
An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was conducted among HCWs and trainees who worked or volunteered at the Hajj 2015-2017 in Makkah and Mina. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables; and odds ratio (OR) was calculated by ""risk estimate"" statistics along with 95% confidence interval (95%CI).
A total of 138 respondents aged 20 to 59 (median 25.6) years with a male to female ratio of 2.5 participated in the survey. Only 11.6% (16/138) participants reported receiving all three vaccines, 15.2% (21/138) did not receive any vaccine; 76.1% (105/138) received meningococcal, 68.1% (94/138) influenza and 13.8% (19/138) pneumococcal vaccine. Females were more likely to receive a vaccine than males (OR 3.6, 95%CI: 1.0-12.7, P < 0.05). Willingness to follow health authority's recommendation was the main reason for receipt of vaccine (78.8%) while believing that they were up-to-date with vaccination (39.8%) was the prime reason for non-receipt.
This survey shows that many HCWs at Hajj miss out the compulsory and highly recommended vaccines; lack of awareness is a key barrier and authority's advice is an important motivator.
Achieving satisfactory vaccination coverage among local HCWs at Hajj remains a challenge. Health education followed by stringent measures may be required to improve their vaccination rate. Evaluation of the role of workplace vaccination campaigns and the ""Basic Infection Control Skills License"" should be considered to better understand the uptake of vaccination among HCWs at Hajj.","Mandatory meningococcal vaccine, and other recommended immunisations: Uptake, barriers, and facilitators among health care workers and trainees at Hajj","Badahdah, Al-Mamoon; Alfelali, Mohammad; Alqahtani, Amani S; Alsharif, Saeed; Barasheed, Osamah; Rashid, Harunor",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6306626/,251,2658,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peak bone mass (PBM) is a significant determinant of osteoporosis. To gain insights into the indicating effect of PBM to osteoporosis, this study focused on characterizing the PBM networks and identifying key genes. One biological data set with 12 monocyte low PBM samples and 11 high PBM samples was derived to construct protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs). Based on clique-merging, module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs. The systematic calculation and comparison were performed to test whether the network entropy can discriminate the low PBM network from high PBM network. We constructed 32 destination networks with 66 modules divided from monocyte low and high PBM networks. Among them, network 11 was the only significantly differential one (P<0.05) with 8 nodes and 28 edges. All genes belonged to precursors of osteoclasts, which were related to calcium transport as well as blood monocytes. In conclusion, based on the entropy in PBM PPINs, the differential network appears to be a novel therapeutic indicator for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte progression; these findings are helpful in disclosing the pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis.","Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disorder characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density, which results in an increased risk of fractures among the elderly (1) . Women, especially postmenopausal women, are more susceptible to osteoporosis comparad to other groups. Bone mass and strength achieved at the end of the growth period is defined as peak bone mass (PBM), which is a significant determinant of osteoporosis (2, 3) . It is regarded that an increase of PBM by one standard deviation would reduce the fracture risk by 50% (4) .
Peripheral blood monocytes can serve as early precursors of osteoclasts (5) (6) (7) . A growing body of literature has explored that blood monocytes deliver many kinds of factors for bone metabolism, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (8) . Osteoclasts in peripheral skeleton (9) and the central skeleton come from circulating monocytes (10) . Substantial research has focused on the effect of circulating monocytes on pathogenesis of osteoporosis in young and middle aged adults.
Research in systems biology has shown that variety in the activity of gene network and frame structure play an important role in the disease progression (11, 12) . Network-based systems biology approaches have emerged as powerful tools for analysis of molecular mechanisms of diseases (13) (14) (15) (16) . An integrated network method was applied to predict conserved regulators related to high and low viral pathogenicity, leading to therapeutic targets for intervention (17) . In addition, recent study confirmed that signaling entropy computable from integrating a gene expression profile with a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN), correlate with phenotypic plasticity and is increased in disease compared to normal controls (18) . Based on information theory, entropy opens new perspectives for gene inference methods and increases the accuracy of PPINs (19) . Jin et al (20) compared the IAV-induced inflammatory regulatory networks and normal cellular networks by integrating the data from the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and the pandemic H1N1 with PPINs, and these findings provide significant hypotheses for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of infectious diseases and developing control strategies.
To gain insights into the indicating effect of PBM to osteoporosis, this study focused on characterizing the PBM networks and identifying key genes by combining high-throughput data and computational techniques. In PPINs, we searched for genes functionally significant for PBM variation, which might were related to circulating monocytes in human premenopausal subjects. The findings are expected to provide effective insights for further exploring the pathology mechanisms of osteoporosis and obtaining better treatment strategies.
Datasets and construction of PPINs. One biological data set E-GEOD-7158 of osteoporosis was derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/geo/) (3). There were 12 monocyte low PBM samples and 11 high PBM samples in the total 23 samples. The platform is A-AFFY-44-Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 (HG-U133 Plus 2.0). The Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) was then used to preprocess data. After quantile data normalization performed by robust multi-array average (RMA) (21), 20,545 genes were obtained.
The human PPIN was collected from the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING; version 9.0) (22) . Only edges whose correlations are greater than the threshold δ were chosen, and set at 0.8. A total of 8,590 nodes and 53,975 protein-protein interaction (PPI) sets remained. Then we constructed anosteoporosis PPI subnet after getting intersection with expression profiles and the PPIN, which contained 7,953 genes and 48,778 PPI sets.
Identification of modules and paired comparison. Using the human subnet as a backbone, we infer a re-weighted PPIN with expression and mutation profiles of monocyte low PBM and high PBM in osteoporosis. Every side of the constructed PPIN was assigned with absolute value of Spearman correlation coefficient of every interaction according to gene expression data.
Based on clique-merging, module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs (23) (24) (25) . We found all maximal cliques from low and high PBM PPIN, and the nodes <4 or >20 were filtered out. Then 8,002 maximal cliques in osteoporosis were obtained.
We identified the set C of all maximal cliques of size at least k in the two groups using a fast depth-first search with pruning-based algorithm (CLIQUES). Next, we calculated its weighted interaction density score (C) as (equation 1):
We ranked these cliques in descending order of their score (C) (23) . A predefined overlap-threshold t 0 =0.5 was set to go through the list repeatedly. The modules were gathered by merging highly overlapping cliques. Accordingly, we captured the effect of differences in interaction weights between monocyte low and high PBM group via the weighted density-based ranking of cliques.
The set of disrupted or altered module pairs were identified by modeling it as a maximum weight bipartite matching. The module correlation density was calculated between low and high PBM group as follows (equation 2):
Characterizing networks from network entropy. Destination networks were constructed with modules of common genes of monocyte low and high PBM groups.
Network entropy, one of metrics of the inflammatory network, was detected in osteoporosis (20) . The local network entropy of a node i, denoted S i , is defined as (equation 3):
In which, k j is the degree of node j, N(i) is the set of neighbor nodes of node i and p ij defines a stochastic probability matrix on the PBM network, which is defined by (equation 4): c ij is the PCC between protein i and j.
The global entropy of destination networks, denoted S, is defined as follows (equation 5): n is the total number of nodes in the destination networks, and C i is the degree centrality of node i, which is defined by (equation 6):
The differential network entropy, denoted ΔS i , is defined as follows (equation 7):
i is the local network entropy of node i in low and high PBM networks.
Significance test. The non-parametric one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test was explored to judge whether the distributions of the global entropy of low and high PBM networks were significantly different (20) . We first permutated sample labels and recalculated the global entropy of the low PBM network, which was repeated L times. The significance level (P-value) of the tests was calculated by {#l|S I l ≤S N o bs for l =l,...,L}/L. S I l and S N o bs are the global entropy of the low PBM network at the 1st time-point and of the high PBM network before this test, respectively. A P-value <0.05 was used to define significantly differential network in this study.
Animals and modeling. A total of 60 female SD rats were purchased from Hebei Medical University Animal Center. All rats were housed at room temperature with 12 h light-dark cycle, and fed with normal chow diet and free access to water. The rat ovariectomy experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hebei Cangzhou Central Hospital, (Cangzhou, China).
After a week of feeding, all rats were randomly and on average separated into 2 groups in which rats were ovariectomized and sham operated at the age of 6 months. Three months after surgery, bone mineral density examination was used to verify if the model was successfully established. All rats in ovariectomized and sham groups were euthanized via exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of isoflurane and carbon dioxide gas (30% gradual-fill chamber vol/min), blood was drawn from the abdominal aorta of rats in each group after the blood pressure and the right femur and then the right femur and third lumbar spine were quickly removed. The number of animals used and their suffering was minimized. Surfaceattached soft tissue were removed, eardrums, vertebral bows and other accessories were retained. The obtained bone tissue was packaged by gauze soaked with saline, and kept at -80˚C in a refrigerator. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar-DPX-IQ; GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI, USA) was used to detect bone density of right femur and third lumbar vertebra.
Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Venous blood sample of models were collected and total RNA was extract by TRIzol RNA kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and purity of total RNA were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. Reverse transcription into cDNA was then conducted by a reverse cDNA transcription kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan). SYBR Ex Script RT-PCR kit (Takara Bio, Inc.) was used to detect the expression of target genes and the primers used in this study is shown in Table I .
Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism version 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistical analyses. All data were shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). For experiments with two groups, t-test was performed. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Experiments were repeated with a minimum of 3 times for each condition.
We used the expression profile data to construct PPINs for the low and high PBM group, respectively. Based on merging highly overlapping cliques, we captured the effect of differences in interaction weights between monocyte low and high PBM group via the weighted density-based ranking of cliques. After the simplification of the modules, 19 modules in low PBM network and 38 in high PBM network were obtained. Then module correlation density was calculated to identify sets of disrupting or altering module pairs between the two networks. A total of 66 modules were identified by modeling it as a maximum weight bipartite matching.
Characterizing differential networks from network entropy. We constructed 32 destination networks with modules divided from monocyte low and high PBM networks. The characteristics of 32 networks are shown in Table Ⅱ . The network entropy was ranged from -3.09 to 0.87 and the max value of network entropy of PBM was 0.87 in network 11. Among them, network 11 was the only significantly differential one with P-value of 0.047 (P<0.05). Fig. 1 shows the differential PBM network with 8 nodes and 28 edges. All genes belonged to precursors of osteoclasts, which were related to calcium transport as well as blood monocytes. It indicated that the network was a novel therapeutic indicator for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte processes.
Bone density of osteoporosis models. As shown in Fig. 2 , 3 months after operation, bone density of right femur and third lumbar vertebra in the osteoporosis group was significant Figure 1. The significantly differential network divided from PBM PPI. The differential PBM network with 8 nodes and 28 edges, a total of 8 genes, PSMA2, PSMB1, PSMC1, PSMC4, PSMD5, PSMD7, PSMD8 and PSMD11, were identified in both monocyte low and high PBM networks. They belonged to precursors of macropain, which were related to calcium transport as well as blood monocytes. PBM, peak bone mass; PPI, protein-protein interaction. Genes Sequences
lower than that in the sham operated group (P<0.05). The result showed that the model was successfully established.
Expression of target genes in osteoporosis models. The results of RT-qPCR showed that compared with sham controls, the expression of target genes in osteoporosis was obviously increased (Fig. 3) . The results indicated that these precursors of osteoclasts, such as PSMD7, PSMC1, PSMA2 and PSMB1, are novel therapeutic indicators for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte progression.
Recently genome-wide gene expression profiles and PPIs hold the major promise to uncover the biological progression, which are subsequently pivotal in getting across molecular mechanisms of diseases (26) . Based on the landscape, functional network entropy can be readily detected to facilitate the valuable application of PPIs on disease research. Previous studies have revealed that increased entropy appears to be a hallmark of cancer systems (27, 28) . Thus we utilized the previous hypothesis that the network entropy could discriminate the inflammatory network from the normal network (20) . The systematic calculation and comparison were performed to test whether the network entropy can also discriminate the low PBM network from high PBM network. By applying a significance test for the difference in global network entropy of low and high PBM networks, we found the global network entropy of PBM networks is significantly differential (P<0.05). The result claimed that the network entropy provided good discrimination between low and high PBM networks. Moreover, this method can serve as a significant foundation for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of other diseases and developing control strategies. One unique advantage of the present method compared with custom networks identifying analysis is that the entropy performs better than other topological metrics of the network in characterizing the inflammatory disease, which was detected by the Network Analyzer plug-in in Cytoscape (20, 29) . Thereby, the significantly different network we captured was more valuable and promising in understanding molecular mechanisms of diseases and reliable in therapeutic options.
Identifying key genes and modules from PPINs is of great help for uncovering the biological functions of genes in networks (30, 31) . In the present study, a total of 8 genes, PSMA2, PSMB1, PSMC1, PSMC4, PSMD5, PSMD7, PSMD8 and PSMD11, were identified in both monocyte low and high PBM networks. They belonged to precursors of macropain, which were related to calcium transport as well as blood monocytes. In a previous study, the surplus/PSMD5 was found to inhibit the assembly and activity of 26S proteasome in human disease (32) . Importantly, neuronal activity and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II could regulate the expression of proteasome (33) . Intracellular calcium mobilization regulates the activity of 26S proteasome during the metaphase-anaphase transition in meiotic cell cycle (34) . At the same time, proteasome inhibitor lactacystin hinders the calcium homeostasis of dopamine neurons (35) . Similar results were also obtained in this study, the results of RT-qPCR in this study showed that compared with sham controls, the expression of target genes in osteoporosis were obviously increased. In other words, the method of network entropy could be used to detect differential networks as indicator of disease. These 8 genes may play important roles in controlling inflammation of the osteoporosis. It suggested that the network is a novel therapeutic indicator for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte progression. These findings are helpful in disclosing the pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis.

169,025ed2caa0ae1ab7f04d3479116e6ed2a334938d,"Background: Cholesterol deficiency (CD), a newly identified autosomal recessive genetic defect in Holstein cattle, is associated with clinical signs of diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypocholesterolemia.
Hypothesis/Objectives: The objective is to describe the clinicopathological phenotype of affected Holstein cattle homozygous for the causative apolipoprotein B gene (APOB) mutation.
Animals: Six Holstein cattle, 5 calves with a clinical history of chronic diarrhea, and 1 heifer with erosions in the buccal cavity and neurologic symptoms were admitted to the Clinic for Ruminants.
Methods: This case review included a full clinical examination, a complete blood count, blood chemistry, and measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides. The animals were euthanized and necropsied. A PCR-based direct gene test was applied to determine the APOB genotype.
Results: All 6 animals were inbred, could be traced back to the sire Maughlin Storm, and were confirmed homozygous for the APOB mutation. The clinical phenotype included poor development, underweight, and intermittent diarrhea in the calves, and neurologic signs in the heifer included hypermetria and pacing. Hypocholesterolemia and low triglycerides concentrations were present in all animals. The pathological phenotype of all animals was steatorrhea with enterocytes of the small intestine containing intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles. The peripheral nervous system of the heifer displayed degenerative changes.
Conclusions and clinical importance: Suspicion of CD in Holstein cattle is based on the presence of chronic diarrhea with no evidence of primary infections. Confirmation of the associated APOB gene mutation is needed. Additionally, the heifer demonstrated primarily signs of neurologic disease providing an unexpected phenotype of CD.","A n inherited autosomal recessive genetic defect in Holstein calves, named cholesterol deficiency (CD), was reported for the first time in the summer of 2015 in Germany. 1, 2 Homozygous calves demonstrate clinical signs of diarrhea unresponsive to treatment and failure to thrive. 1 They suffer marked hypocholesterolemia and hypolipidemia, indicating an inherited fat metabolism disorder. These animals usually die within the first 6 months of life, and it has been assumed that about 80% of homozygous affected calves do not survive more than 1 year. 1 Heterozygous carrier animals do not show any clinical signs but have reduced levels of blood cholesterol and triglycerides. 1 Breeding organizations in Switzerland and other countries have reported an increasing occurrence of cases in Holstein cattle. The causal mutation has recently been identified in the apolipoprotein B gene (APOB). 3 A 1,299-bp insertion of a transposable element located in exon 5 of bovine APOB was shown to be perfectly associated with the disease and leads to truncated transcripts and aberrant splicing. 3 The Canadian artificial insemination Holstein sire Maughlin Storm, born in 1991, has been identified genetically to be the first carrier bull. 2 A significant recent advancement has been the development of a PCR-based direct gene test, allowing the detection of animals with CD without pedigree information. 3 In human patients, truncating mutations in APOB give rise to familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL). The APOB encodes 2 proteins via a mRNA-editing process: the APOB-48 protein is required for chylomicron production in the small intestine, and the APOB-100 protein is expressed in the liver. The APOB-100 protein is a structural component of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its metabolic products and serves as the ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipid particles. 4 The clinical consequences of the mutation are well described in human medicine, but have not been described to date in cattle. The aim of this report is to describe the clinical and pathological phenotype associated with the genetic defect of APOB causing this new disease entity in Holstein cattle.
Five Holstein calves (3 females, 2 males) and a 2.5-year-old heifer were referred to the Clinic for Ruminants of the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Switzerland. The calves had a history of failure to thrive and intermittent diarrhea unresponsive to treatment since birth. The mean age of the calves was 86 days (min-max: 18-224 days), and the mean weight was 69 kg (min-max: 41-153 kg), as shown in Table 1 . The heifer (472 kg) had shown poor development and intermittent diarrhea in the first months of life, but had no longer shown diarrhea later on; it was presented to the Clinic with a primary complaint of lesions in the buccal cavity. A complete clinical examination of all animals was performed, and a CBC and blood chemistry profile was performed for calves numbered (no.) 1, 2, and 3. In addition, cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in all animals and were compared to a group of 5 healthy Holstein calves and a group of 5 inappetent Holstein calves with other diseases than diarrhea (Table 1) . Fecal samples were sent for routine viral, bacterial, and parasitological analyses to exclude the most common pathogens causing calf diarrhea (rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidia, coccidia, E. coli, and Salmonella spp.). Dietetic causes for diarrhea were excluded by clinical history. The animals were tested for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) using an antigen-ELISA a on a skin biopsy (≤180 days in life) or an EDTA blood sample (>180 days in life). All animals were euthanized (Phenobarbitalum natricum, 100 mg/ kg i.v.) b 1-14 days after admission to the Clinic, based on the poor prognosis and suspicion of CD. A complete necropsy was performed on all animals. Fresh tissue samples were immediately fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut at 4 lm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). As lipids are removed from tissues during routine histological processing, for the visualization of lipids, optimal cutting temperature compound (O.C.T.) (Tissue-Tek) c -embedded frozen sections of small and large intestine and liver were stained with Sudan stain. Selected brain, spinal cord, and nerve sections of the heifer were stained with Luxol fast blue and Bielschowsky, respectively. Electron microscopical analysis was performed on small intestinal villi and liver of animals no. 5 and 6. Formalin-fixed tissue samples were postfixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 hour at 4°C and embedded in Epon. d Semi-thin sections were stained with toluidine blue and used to narrow down further regions of interest. Sections were collected on collodion-coated 200 mesh copper grids. e Sections were double stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate f for 30 minutes at 40°C and 3% lead citrate g for 10 minutes at 20°C in an Ultrastain h and examined in a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope i at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Micrographs were captured with a Mega View III camera using the iTEM software. j The presence of the APOB mutation was demonstrated by a PCR-based direct gene test described elsewhere. 3 
The physical examination of the 5 calves revealed a slightly reduced general condition. The calves were severely emaciated with normal appetite (Fig 1) . The weight of the affected animals and of healthy Holstein cattle at the same age is shown in detail in Table 2 . Examination of the digestive system revealed normal activity of the gastrointestinal tract, and percussion and succession auscultation were negative in both flanks. The feces had a yellow to olive-green color, normal smell, and, at variable intervals over an observation period of up to 14 days, a fecal consistency which changed between soft (normal) and liquid (intermittent diarrhea). In addition, the feces of calf no. 1 contained undigested fibers (>2 cm in length). Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems showed no abnormalities. The calves' gait was normal. The blood concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides were distinctly below the values obtained from the 5 healthy control calves and from 5 calves affected with diseases other than diarrhea (Table 1) . No abnormalities were detected in the CBC and chemistry profiles performed for 3 calves. A moderate amount of acanthocytes was observed in the blood smear of calf no. 2. Calf no. 3 showed a slight anemia with a hematocrit of 17% (norm: 19-34%) and a low selenium concentration (47 lg/L, norm: >50 lg/L). Coprological examinations revealed the presence of few Eimeria bovis oocysts in calf no. 1 and Cryptosporidium parvum in calf no. 2. All calves tested negative for BVDV, rotavirus, and coronavirus, and bacterial cultures for E. coli and Salmonella spp. were also negative.
The 2.5-year-old and 4-month pregnant heifer (no. 6) presented with a complaint of anorexia and buccal lesions. Infectious causes were excluded, and the stomatitis was treated symptomatically. In addition, the animal was in a moderately reduced general condition and slightly emaciated ( Table 2 ). Despite resolution of the digestive problem, restored appetite and activity of the gastrointestinal tract, hypermetria, and pacing, suggestive of a diffuse cortical lesion, remained apparent upon neurologic examination. The cerebrospinal fluid showed a slight pleocytosis (9.7 cells/lL, norm: 3 cells/lL) with 39% monocytes and 61% lymphocytes. The pandy test for proteins was slightly positive. The blood concentrations of cholesterol (0.11 mmol/L, norm: 1.20-3.84 mmol/L) and triglycerides (0.03 mmol/L, norm: 0.19-0.51 mmol/L) were similar to those of the affected calves ( Table 1 ). The heifer tested negative for BVDV. Coprological examination revealed the presence of a few Trichuris spp. eggs. Diarrhea was not observed in this animal.
Macroscopical examination showed that all animals were emaciated. The anus and perianal region of calves no. 1-5 were soiled with feces, which was interpreted as a sign of diarrhea. Calf no. 1 and the heifer (no. 6) had a moderate amount of fat reserves, whereas calves no. 2-5 were cachectic.
The small intestine of all animals was diffusely filled with a moderate amount of bright yellow, beige to limegreen, liquid, and partially foamy to fatty content (Fig 2A) . The mucosa of the distal two thirds of the small intestine was severely edematous and appeared whitish (Fig 2A) . The large intestine was filled with a yellow to green liquid with a partially foamy to fatty content, consistent with steatorrhea. The rectal contents of calf no. 1 and the heifer (no. 6) appeared less liquid than those from calves no. 2-5. Histological changes were most prominent in the small intestine and accentuated in the jejunum in all animals. The enterocytes covering the tips of the villi contained large amounts of optically empty, round to oval vacuoles, ranging from 2 to 20 lm in diameter ( Fig 2B) . Multifocally, the nuclei of the affected enterocytes were displaced to the basal cell borders. In frozen sections, these intracytoplasmic vacuoles and large parts of the intestinal content were positively stained by Sudan stain indicating lipid origin (Fig 2B) . Furthermore, multiple lacteals were moderately to severely dilated, correlating with the macroscopically visible edema. No pathomorphological or pathohistological lesions were observed in the liver. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) corroborated the presence of large intracytoplasmic lipid droplets in the small intestinal enterocytes. The droplets filled most of the supranuclear cytoplasm but also occurred in an infranuclear position ( Fig 2C) . In other respects, organelles and intercellular spaces were typical. Furthermore, isolated lipid droplets were seen in hepatocytes but to a minor extent as compared with the enterocytes, excluding a hepatic steatosis on TEM level. Histologically, single dilated myelin sheaths containing fragmented axons and macrophages without any particular distribution pattern were observed in the central nervous system (CNS) of the heifer. The variation of nerve fiber size and the proportion of small nerve fibers appeared to be increased in the sciatic nerve of the heifer, compared to a control animal of the same age (Fig 2D) . Myelin sheaths of numerous axons were decreased in thickness and, multifocally, hypertrophied Schwann cells enclosed the myelin sheaths. In the eyes, no retinal degeneration was present.
Pedigree analysis indicated familial relationships among affected animals, and the distribution of affected animals in both genders was suggestive of an autosomal recessive genetic defect (Fig 3) . Analysis of the genealogy of all 6 affected animals revealed a relation to the sire Maughlin Storm on the maternal and on the paternal side (Fig 3) . This Holstein sire has been reported as the possible founder of the inherited CD disorder in previous investigations. 1 months. Most of these calves died within a couple of days or weeks. An APOB mutation causing CD was recently identified partially based on the data provided in this investigation. 3 The homozygous presence of the APOB insertion was subsequently confirmed in all 6 affected animals. The 4-month-old fetus of the heifer was tested heterozygous for the APOB insertion.
The most consistent clinical features in the CD calves were intermittent diarrhea and failure to thrive associated with hypocholesterolemia and low triglyceride concentrations. While the clinical signs were unspecific and of moderate intensity, the CD-affected animals had distinctly lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride values than the control calves. The 2.5year-old heifer showed similarly low values in cholesterol and triglycerides, but the most prominent clinical features (after resolution of the stomatitis) were the neurologic symptoms. However, this animal had also shown intermittent diarrhea as a calf, based on which the pedigree of the heifer was reviewed, and it was subjected to a genetic test. Indeed, the pathological phenotype of the homozygous APOB mutant heifer was comparable to the phenotype of the 5 affected calves. Taking the pathological findings of steatorrhea, the histological and TEM phenotype of lipid vacuole accumulation within the enterocytes of the tips of the villi in the small intestine and the clinical symptoms of hypocholesterolemia, low triglyceride concentration, and the neurologic symptoms into account, bovine CD is highly similar to human FHBL. 4, 5 Acanthocytosis, described as one of the earliest laboratory features of FHBL in humans, was present in one calf. 5, 6 Over 60 truncating APOB mutations have been identified as causes for FHBL. 5 We previously demonstrated that the mutant proteins in the liver do not fulfill any physiological function in cattle homozygous for the bovine APOB mutation. 3 Therefore, it is highly probable that both physiological APOB protein isoforms are missing. Currently, it is not known if mutant APOB proteins are expressed in CD-affected cattle or not, and this should be subject to further investigation. 3 Impaired function of human APOB-100 protein results in decreased triglyceride export (by LDL receptormediated endocytosis) from the liver, which in turn leads to the development of fatty liver. 7 None of the investigated cattle had signs of fatty liver (hepatic steatosis), leading to the assumption that hepatic steatosis due to APOB-100 protein dysfunction is not a feature of CD in cattle. Alternatively, the absence of hepatic steatosis in our CD calves and heifer might be explained by the differences in fat metabolism between ruminants and humans. In humans, most of the de novo fatty acid synthesis takes place in the liver with glucose as a basic substrate. 8, 9 In ruminating animals, acetate absorbed from the rumen is the substrate for direct de novo synthesis of fatty acids. 8 Acetate is produced by microbial fermentation of cellulose in the rumen and stored in adipose tissue as well as used for milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland of lactating animals. 8, 10 Thus, the main site of fatty acid synthesis in ruminants is the adipose tissue and the mammary gland, not the liver. 8, 11 However, this applies to ruminating animals, ie, in our case animals no. 1 and 6, as calves no. 2-5 were still mostly fed with milk. Therefore, intestinal absorption may still have played a more important role in lipid intake and digestive processes in these calves may have been more comparable to the human fat metabolism. This explanation is supported by the fact that the calves on a diet milk based were cachectic, whereas the 2 ruminating animals had still some abdominal fat reserves. This might suggest that the specific metabolism of ruminants allows for the accumulation of some fat reserves in CD animals as soon as they start ruminating. In humans, truncation mutations in APOB affecting the APOB-48 protein were shown to result in defective chylomicron formation in the small intestine. 4, 5 This protein is exclusively synthesized in enterocytes of the small intestine. 12 The histologically visible accumulation of lipid vacuoles within the enterocytes in the CD-affected cattle indicates that the enterocytes of these animals are capable of resorbing fat from the ingesta. The hypocholesterolemia and low triglycerides concentrations, however, demonstrate that the transfer of these lipids from the enterocytes into the blood is impaired or even absent. Thus, these histological findings further support a chylomicron formation defect due to the lack of the APOB-48 protein, as it has been described in FHBL. 4, 12 In human patients, FHBL is additionally characterized by malabsorption of lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), leading to retinal degeneration, neuropathy, and coagulopathy. 6 These neurologic disorders are associated with cerebellar dysfunction and compromising of the posterior column function with demyelination in the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS). 5, 6 We assume that the examined calves were too young to present clinical and pathological signs of chronic cholesterol and lipid deficiency and/or chronic lipid-soluble vitamin deficiencies. In contrast, the hypermetria observed in the heifer, which was first interpreted as a sign of cortical dysfunction in combination with abnormal gait (pacing), might also have been due to cerebellar dysfunction. 13 In the heifer, the histological lesions were mild in general, but were most prominent in the PNS and only minimal in the CNS. Peripheral neuropathy has been described in humans in association with abetalipoproteinemia (ABL), a similar genetic fat metabolism disorder. 14 However, this needs further study of additional older affected animals, including examination of semithin sections and ultrastructural studies. We assume that the mild changes in the sciatic nerve observed in the heifer might be a consequence of APOB mutation. Therefore, it represents a possible further histological feature of APOBassociated CD in cattle. Because no clinical PNS symptoms were present, the question whether the histological lesions are of clinical relevance remains open. Severe demyelination within the CNS as described in FHBL in humans 5, 6 was not visible by light microscopy in the heifer. Therefore, we cannot exclude a functional cause of the clinical CNS symptoms. Calves with CD are described to usually die within the first 6 months of life. 1 Thus, the case of the 2.5-yearold heifer is a rare example of an adult animal surviving the initial phase of CD. The heifer may have established chronic cholesterol and lipid deficiency and/or chronic lipid-soluble vitamin deficiencies as described in FHBL. Upon treatment, young human patients with FHBL can expect to return to a normal growth rate, although they may not reach their full growth potential. 4 In fact, it is proposed that FHBL might be a longevity syndrome, as a result of low LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream, 15 leading to absence of atherosclerosis. 16 The treatment described for humans, ie, total fat restriction and lipid-soluble vitamin supplementation, 5, 6 is not applicable in cattle. Exceptionally older CD cattle, like the heifer in our study, are particularly interesting animals for further investigation concerning the pathogenesis of the disease. The possibility of a natural large animal model for human FHBL could be explored with further investigations.
The main limitations for the diagnosis of CD in cattle are the unspecific clinical symptoms of diarrhea and failure to thrive in young calves. It is important, as demonstrated by the affected animals described here which belong to an age group most susceptible for various diarrhea-causing pathogens, to first exclude common agents causing diarrhea. However, as shown by the findings of 2 calves excreting oocysts of Eimeria bovis and Cryptosporidium parvum and, in the case of the heifer, Trichuris spp., CD can be present concomitantly with pathogens causing diarrhea. In case of intermittent diarrhea resistant to treatment in young Holstein cattle, analysis of total cholesterol and triglycerides can lead to a suspicion of CD. Pathological investigations are only diagnostic, if samples of the small intestine are immediately fixed in formalin (within minutes after euthanasia). Otherwise, the lipid vacuoles in the enterocytes of the villi tips are lost due to immediate autolytic changes in the small intestine. A clinical or pathological suspicion of CD should be confirmed using the gene test detecting the APOB mutation after consideration of pedigree information indicating inbreeding linked to the founder sire Maughlin Storm. 3 This newly developed diagnostic tool will allow a reduction in unnecessary treatment costs, use of antibiotics, and time-consuming care of affected animals. The early diagnosis of CD will enable targeted eradication of the APOB mutation from the Holstein population and thus prevent economical losses in the future.

In eukaryotes and viruses that infect them, the 5 0 end of mRNA molecules, and also many other functionally important RNAs, are modified to form a so-called cap structure that is important for interactions of these RNAs with many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The RNA cap has multiple roles in gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and translation initiation. Apart from guanosine addition to the 5 0 end in the most typical cap structure common to transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (in particular mRNA), essentially all cap modifications are due to methylation. The complexity of the cap structure and its formation can range from just a single methylation of the unprocessed 5 0 end of the primary transcript, as in mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2, and plant U3 RNAs, to an elaborate m 7 Gpppm 6,6 AmpAmpCmpm 3 Um structure at the 5 0 end of processed RNA in trypanosomes, which are formed by as many as 8 methylation reactions. While all enzymes responsible for methylation of the cap structure characterized to date were found to belong to the same evolutionarily related and structurally similar Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase superfamily, that uses the same methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine; the enzymes also exhibit interesting differences that are responsible for their distinct functions. This review focuses on the evolutionary classification of enzymes responsible for cap methylation in RNA, with a focus on the sequence relationships and structural similarities and dissimilarities that provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis of different caps in cellular and viral RNAs. Particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between methyltransferases from human cells and from human pathogens that may be helpful in the development of antiviral and antiparasitic drugs.","Nascent transcripts produced by RNA polymerases universally carry a 5 0 triphosphate (5 0 ppp). Processed RNA molecules, such as rRNAs and tRNAs, generated from precursors whose 5 0 segments were removed by nucleolytic cleavage, carry a 5 0 monophosphate (5 0 p). In several types of cellular and viral RNAs, the 5 0 end is further modified enzymatically, by a variety of modification enzymes, to introduce various chemical structures that are collectively dubbed as the ""5 0 caps"". This cap is absent in bacterial and archaeal transcripts.
The most typical and widely studied cap modification comprises the addition of an N 7 -methylguanosine (m 7 G) linked via an inverted 5 0 -5 0 triphosphate bridge to the 5 0 -terminal nucleoside of the transcript. 1 This structure termed cap0 is a characteristic feature of transcripts that are produced by RNA polymerase II, such as messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of all eukaryotic organisms and many viral RNAs. It is typically introduced in sequential steps: (1) hydrolysis of 5 0 g-phosphate of a nascent pre-mRNA to generate a 5 0 diphosphate mRNA end; (2) transfer of a guanine monophosphate nucleoside; and (3) methylation of the guanine at the N 7 position. The cap0 structure was shown to be essential for cell growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2 and survival of mammalian cells; 3 it is critical for mRNA interactions with many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins and has multiple important roles in gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and translation initiation. 4, 5 Enzymes responsible for cap0 formation have been well characterized in many organisms and viruses.
In many instances, m 7 G-capped RNAs are modified further, in particular by additional methylation steps at the cap0 guanosine or methylation of the first few transcribed nucleoside residues. For instance, the cap0 guanosine is modified by addition of 2 methyl groups at the N 2 position, yielding a trimethylguanosine (m 2,2,7 G or TMG) cap, in some small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) required for pre-mRNA splicing (e.g., U1, U2, U4, and U5), pre-rRNA processing (U3 and U8), and telomere addition (telomerase RNA), as well as in several selenoprotein mRNAs. 6 In higher eukaryotes, the 5 0 ends of mRNA and snRNA are modified further by ribose 2 0 -O-methylation on the first and second transcribed nucleosides, yielding cap1 and cap2 modifications, respectively. 7 In humans, cap0 and cap1 methylations are found on all mRNA molecules, while about half of the capped and polyadenylated RNA molecules contain a 2 0 -O-methylated residue at the second transcribed position. 8 The U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs are methylated at both the first 2 positions. 9 Cap1 and cap2 methylations in U2 snRNA are required for the formation of spliceosomal E-complex and, as a consequence, for efficient pre-mRNA splicing. 10 In some organisms, such as in Trypanosomes, as many as 4 first residues of the nascent transcript undergo ribose methylation, to generate the cap4 structure. 11 These additional methylation steps are often important for RNA processing, translation and stability, although their role has not been fully elucidated.
Alternative capping pathways have been invented by certain viruses. For instance, in Alphaviruses, the precursor of cap0 is first methylated to a m 7 G triphosphate and only then connected to the 5 0 end of the RNA. 12 Nonsegmented negative-sense (nsNS) RNA viruses have evolved a different mechanism for mRNA cap formation in that the guanylyltransferase transfers GDP rather than GMP onto the 5 0 end of the RNA and the resulting cap structure is first monomethylated on the ribose of the first transcribed residue (yielding GpppAm structure), and only later the guanosine is methylated to m 7 G. [13] [14] [15] In addition to ribose 2 0 -O-methylation, base moieties of the first transcribed nucleosides may be methylated, thereby increasing the catalog of 5 0 cap structures. In particular, the first adenine nucleoside of the transcript is often methylated at the N 6 position. 16 In Trypanosomes, the fourth uridine residue is also methylated at the N 3 position. The role of these base methylations is unclear, and the enzymes responsible for these modifications remain to be characterized.
Some small RNAs, including mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2, and plant U3, present a completely different 5 0 cap structure, which is chemically minimalistic compared to the elaborate guanosine cap. This alternative cap is generated by methylation of a g-phosphate oxygen at the unprocessed 5 0 end of the primary transcript. 17 It is clear that apart from guanosine addition to the 5 0 end, essentially all cap modifications are due to methylations. The cap structure of mRNAs in trypanosomes, m 7 Gpppm 6,6 Am-pAmpCmpm 3 Um, is formed with as many as 8 methylation steps. In all cases that have been experimentally characterized to date, methylations of caps in all organisms and viruses are catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases ( Table 1) . For the most common types of methylation reactions implicated in cap modification, the crystal structures of the representative proteins have been determined ( Table 2) . All cap methyltransferases characterized structurally belong to the Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase (RFM) superfamily. 18 The topology of the RFM fold is very similar to the typical Rossmann fold (#6-#5-#4-#1-#2-#3), with an additional, 7 th ß-strand inserted into the sheet in an antiparallel manner (#6-""7-#5-#4-#1-#2-#3) (Fig. 1) . 18, 19 The methyl group donor (SAM) binding site is formed by loops following strands 1, 2, and 3, while the substrate to be methylated is typically bound by loops following strands 4, 5, and 6. Various families of RFM enzymes exhibit fusions with other domains, extensions of termini, and insertions within the conserved RFM domain, in particular following strand 5. These elaborations of the common fold are often involved in substrate binding or in oligomerization. 20, 21 In this review, we discuss cellular and viral methyltransferases involved in 5 0 cap RNA biosynthesis, with emphasis on the sequence structure relationships in the light of the experimentally determined structures of enzymes complexed with their ligands. We focus on comparison of enzymes with similar activities that generate products with chemically similar structures.
Throughout the article, we follow the nomenclature of cap modifying enzymes and their products commonly used in the literature. We use terms ""capX methylation"" and ""capX methyltransferase"" (where X is a number) to refer to some enzymatic activity or its product at a particular position X. On the other hand, the term ""capX structure"" is used to refer to a fully modified cap structure. For instance ""cap2 structure"" indicates a cap methylated on the inverted guanosine and the first 2 ribose sugars in the nucleotide sequence; i.e., m 7 GpppN 1 mN 2 m. It should be emphasized that some of the cap methyltranserases discussed here have not yet been fully characterized and it cannot be ruled out that they act at multiple positions.
Cap-specific m 7 G methyltransferases Cellular and viral RNA cap guanine-N 7 -methyltrasferases methylate RNA with the GpppN 5 0 terminus to form an m 7 GpppN (cap0) structure. Eukaryotic enzymes catalyze this reaction in the nucleus. Many viruses, however, replicate in the cytoplasm of their eukaryotic host, and the cellular capping machinery is not accessible for their RNAs; hence, these viruses have evolved their own capping enzymes to form a cap structure that can be recognized by the cellular translation machinery for gene expression. Examples include Flaviviridae, Nidovirales, Mononegavirales and Poxviridae (reviewed in ref. 12) . While the cellular and viral mRNA capping apparatus is functionally similar, the enzyme organization differs greatly across evolution.
The Abd1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a monofunctional cap0 methyltransferase, and biochemically has been one of the best studied methyltransferases involved in cap structure biosynthesis. 2, 22, 23 Its enzymatic activity is critical for yeast cell growth and the gene ABD1 that encodes the Abd1 protein is essential. Abd1 is a founding member of a protein family that is strongly conserved in eukaryotes as well as in viruses. 24 The crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Abd1 itself could not be determined, but eventually it was solved for its homolog, the Ecm1 protein from E. cuniculi (Fig. 2) . 25 Purified Ecm1 is a monomeric protein that catalyzes methyl transfer to GpppRNA to form cap0, but also to free mononucleotides GTP, GDP or dGTP (deoxy-GTP). The methyltransferase domain in Ecm1, and by inference also in other homologous cap0 methyltransferases, exhibits the RFM fold with a characteristic insertion that forms a characteristic b-meander structure involved in the formation of the capbinding site. This insertion is common between methyltransferases that methylate G to m 7 G in the RNA cap, and methyltransferases that N-methylate the amino acid glycine. This relationship between 2 different types of methyltransferases, as well as the cap0 methyltransferase structure, were correctly predicted using bioinformatics 24 before the first structure of the cap0 methyltransferase was determined.
In the human capping system, the cap0 methyltransferase (RNMT) consists of a catalytic subunit related to Abd1 and an obligate activating subunit, RAM (RNMT-activating miniprotein). 26 The C-terminal catalytic domain of RNMT has essentially the same structure as Abd1. RNMT also has an N-terminal domain that is conserved in mammals, but not required for catalytic activity. However, it contains 2 nuclear localization signal motifs and the nuclear localization of RNMT is essential for cell viability. The cap0 methyltransferases, members of the abovementioned family, were also identified and chartacterized in other eukaryotes, including TbCmt1 in Trypanosoma brucei, for example. 27 As mentioned above, the viral cap0 methyltransferases possess a catalytic domain that is closely related to the eukaryotic cap0 methyltransferases, but it often functions in the context of other domains. For instance, the vaccinia virus possesses an enzyme that is composed of D1 and D12 polypeptides that execute all 3 steps in cap0 biosynthesis. The D1 subunit contains triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities in the N-terminal domain, and a cap0 methyltransferase domain that forms a heterodimer with the D12 subunit. 28, 29 The methyltransferase active site is located entirely in the D1 subunit and has a weak cap0 modification activity that is stimulated allosterically by D12. [30] [31] [32] Interestingly, the D12 structure resembles a degenerate cap 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase domain (see below), but it lacks a proper SAM binding site and does not show any methyltransferase activity on its own. 33 In the SARS-coronavirus, a nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) was initially identified as an exoribonuclease (and termed ExoN). Later, it was shown that it also exhibits cap0 methyltransferase activity. Analysis of protein variants with substitutions of conserved residues in the ExoN (N-terminal) and methyltransferase (C-terminal) domains revealed that both active sites are functionally distinct; however, the integrity of the ExoN domain turned out to be essential for the function of the cap0 methyltransferase domain. 34 Nsp14 shows little sequence similarity to known methyltransferases; however, its structure has not been determined experimentally, hence its phylogenetic relationships to other enzymes remain unclear.
Cap-specific 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases A poxvirus cap1-forming enzyme (VP39 protein from vaccinia virus), was the first methyltransferase involved in the cap structure formation, for which a crystal structure was determined 35 and also the first one for which a structure of a ternary complex of an enzyme with the cofactor and RNA substrate was determined. 36 It has become one of the best studied members of a large family of methyltransferases that act on the 2 0 -OH-ribose group in RNA, which includes also enzymes such as RrmJ and fibrillarin. 37 Although they share little sequence identity with each other, these 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases are characterized by the presence of a conserved tertiary fold characteristic for all RFM enzymes and a conserved K-D-K catalytic triad between the methyl group donor binding site, and the cap binding site. VP39 is a single-domain protein with additional structural elements at both the N-and C-termini, which wrap around the RFM core and form a binding pocket for the cap. In the ternary complex, the m 7 G base of the cap is bound sandwiched between 2 aromatic side chains, and oriented in such a way that the Hoogsteen edge modified by addition of the methyl group on N 7 faces the protein, thus explaining the ability of VP39 to sense the methylation status of the substrate, which is the basis of its preference for substrates that already have an N 7 -methylated cap.
In humans, cap1 formation is catalyzed by the CMTr1 enzyme. 38 It is composed of several domains, including the Nterminal catalytic RMF domain with a conserved K-D-K triad characteristic for 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases and a guanylyltransferase-like domain that lacks catalytic residues. 39 The N-terminal domain of CMTr1 shares a global architecture with the VP39 protein and is sufficient for cap1 activity in vitro. Interestingly, while the cofactor-binding sites, active sites, and the sites of binding of the nascent RNA chain exhibits similarities with the VP39 and CMTr1 enzymes (and likewise the conformations of the respective ligands), their cap-binding sites exhibit large differences in the shape of the m 7 G-binding pocket. As a result, CMTr1 binds m 7 G in a different way, in which the sugar edge of the cap guanosine faces the protein, and the methyl group on N7 faces the solvent (Fig. 3) . These structural differences explain why CMTr1 is relatively insensitive to the absence of cap0 methylation and therefore is able to act, at least in vitro, on substrates with unmethylated guanosine. Proteins with cap1 methyltransferase activities were also characterized in the alfalfa looper moth Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (orf69 40 ) and in T. brucei (TbMTr1 41, 42 ). Both of these enzymes are relatively closely related to the human CMTr1 enzyme.
In the SARS virus, cap1 methylation is catalyzed by a complex comprised of 2 partners: the nsp16 protein that is clearly related to the above-mentioned cap1 methyltransferases, but is inactive on its own, and a small regulatory protein nsp10 that is required for nsp16 to bind both the SAM methyl group donor and the RNA substrate. The crystal structure of the snp10-nsp16 complex showed that, in nsp16, the SAM-binding region is partially degenerated compared to ""partner-independent"" ribose methyltransferases, and nsp10 stabilizes the SAM binding pocket and extends the RNA-binding groove of nsp16. 43 Apart from the enzymes responsible for cap1 methylation, methyltransferases have been characterized that act on additional residues in the nascent RNA chain. Many eukaryotic organisms possess a 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase that methylates the 2 nd residue in mRNA and in other RNA molecules. The cap2 methyltransferase has been characterized in T. brucei (TbMTr2 44, 45 ) and in humans (CMTr2 46 ). Interestingly, while CMTr2 appears to be closely related to its human paralog CMTr1 as well as to TbMTr1, TbMTr2 is more closely related to the vaccinia virus cap1 methyltransferase. 44 In trypanosomes, a third 2 0 -O-ribose cap methyltransferase was identified and termed TbMTr3, which is responsible for the methylation of the third residue of the cap and is required for the methylation of the fourth residue. 47, 48 TbMTr3 is a close relative of TbMTr2 and of VP39, and is only remotely related to other eukaryotic cap 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases, which suggests that trypanosomes acquired enzymes for ""additional"" methylation by adapting proteins from viruses. A phylogenetic study of 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases revealed that the relationships between cellular and viral enzymes are quite complex, and that these proteins can vary greatly in number even in closely-related organisms. Furthermore, alveolate species were identified that possessed as many as 4 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases, suggesting that certain enzymes of this group may act with different substrate specificities or that new cap structures with additional methylation sites remain to be discovered. 46 Proteins with cap0 and cap1 methyltransferase activities A number of viral proteins were reported to possess both cap0 and cap1 methyltransferase activities. In most of them, this is due to the presence of multiple domains. For instance, in the human reovirus (a virus with a dsRNA genome), the cap structure formation is catalyzed by a large multidomain protein lambda 2, which in turn is a part of the reovirus core: an assembly with a relative molecular mass of 52 MDa that synthesizes, modifies and exports viral mRNA. The structure of the human reovirus core has been solved at low resolution, revealing a series of domains that include a putative guanylyltransferase domain and 2 putative methyltransferase (RFM) domains. 49 It has been suggested that the order of the domains in the lambda 2 protein corresponds to the order of the capping reactions: guanosine transfer followed by cap0 and cap1 methylation. However, comparison of domain structures suggested that the functional assignments may be different, as the RFM domain 1 shared a putative active site with the corresponding structurally characterized 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases, including the cap1 methyltransferase, whereas the RFM domain 2 exhibited structural similarity to the cap0 methyltransferases. 50 It should be noted that the putative cap1 methyltransferase domain of reovirus exhibits a similar cap-binding platform formed by N-and C-terminal extensions, as in VP39 and human CMTr1 enzymes; however, its putative m 7 G-binding site is more open.
In bluetongue virus, another member of the reoviruses, the structure of the VP4 protein revealed a multi-domain protein with an N-terminal guanylyltransferase domain and 2 RFM domains, of which one was inserted into another. The inserted RFM domain exhibited clear similarities to the cap1 methyltransferases and in 3 crystal forms had GpppG, m 7 GDP, or GTP bound in the position of the cap-binding site, while the other RFM domain exhibited low but significant similarity to known cap0 methyltransferase structures. 51 In the non-segmented, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses [order Mononegavirales (MNV)] that include pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus, measles, mumps, rabies, parainfluenza, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Marburg and Ebola viruses, one of the common components of the viral ribonucleoprotein core is the large (L) protein, which encodes multiple functions such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and activities responsible for mRNA capping, cap0 and cap1 methylation, poly(A) polymerase and protein kinase. 52, 53 Using bioinformatics methods, we and others predicted that the C-terminal region of that protein (conserved region VI) encodes a domain homologous to 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases and is likely to function as a cap1 methyltransferase. 54, 55 Later it was found that, in VSV, this region is essential not only for cap1, but also for cap0 methyltransferase activity and that the same SAM-binding site and part of the K-D-K triad is used for both reactions. 15, 56 The structural basis of this phenomenon remains to be determined.
In Flaviviruses (positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses), an RFM domain with a similar dual methyltransferase function was identified. In a non-structural protein 5, the N-terminus was first unambiguously characterized as a cap1 (2 0 -O-ribose) methyltransferase. Later, it was shown that this domain takes part also in cap0 (m 7 G) methylation using the same SAM-binding site during cap synthesis. 57, 58 Interestingly, in these viruses, the order of methylation is different than in Mononegavirales, as cap0 methylation precedes cap1 methylation. Several structures were determined for the flavivirus cap methyltransferases known or predicted to be bifunctional, including Dengue, 59 West Nile, 60 Wesselbron, 61 Meaban, 62 and Murray Valley encephalitis 63 viruses and they all revealed high similarity to the cap1 methyltransferases, and little if any similarity to the classical cap0 methyltransferases. It should be noted that these methyltransferases share a similar cap-binding platform structure with VP39 and human CMTr1 enzymes (a platform formed by N-and C-terminal extensions); however, the orientation of the bound guanosine residue suggests that their mode of cap-recognition is different from both poxvirus and human enzymes (Fig. 3) .
The enzyme responsible for the trimethylguanosine (m 2,2,7 G, TMG) synthesis was first identified in yeast and named yTgs1. 64 The Tgs enzymes of budding and fission yeast and Giardia are relatively small polypeptides (239-315 amino acids) consisting of little more than an RFM methyltransferase catalytic domain (Fig. 4) , whereas metazoan Tgs1 proteins are much larger, because they include an N-terminal extension not found in lower eukaryotes. 65, 66 Tgs1 activity is strictly dependent on prior cap0 (m 7 G) methylation, thereby restricting its activity to RNAs that were already methylated by cap0 methyltransferase. 67 Similar substrate requirements are characteristic for the Giardia Tgs2 enzyme. 68 Interestingly, in contrast to Tgs1 methyltransferases able to catalyze 2 sequential N2 methylation steps leading to TMG cap formation, Tgs2 activity is apparently limited to a single round of N2 methylation, resulting in the synthesis of a 2,7dimethylguanosine (m 2,7 G) product. Bioinformatics analyses predicted that the Tgs enzymes are related to a large group of RFM enzymes that act on exocyclic amine groups in nucleic acid bases, including m 6 A, m 4 C, and m 2 G and have a characteristic NPPY-like motif at the active site. 66 The crystal structure of the active C-terminal methyltransferase domain of the human TGS enzyme bound to a minimal substrate m 7 GTP as well as the reaction product SAH has been reported, confirming these predictions and revealing the atomic details of these protein-ligand interactions. 69, 70 Other methyltransferases involved in cap-specific base modifications
Studies of cap composition of human mRNAs conducted in mid-70s revealed that when the first nucleotide of the transcript is an adenosine, this base can be methylated to m 6 A. 8, 71 The enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of m 7 GpppAm ends of mRNA to m 7 Gpppm 6 Am has been isolated from a cytoplasmic fraction of HeLa cells. The isolated enzyme showed no activity toward internal adenosines. 72 Recently, Schwartz and coworkers studied the m 6 A mRNA methylome following depletion of multiprotein methyltransferase complex components METTL3, METTL14, KIAA1429, and WTAP, and implicated the involvement of the METTL3, METTL14, and KIAA1429 proteins in m 6 A formation at the internal sites but not at the 5 0 sites. 73 The full characterization of the cap-specific m 6 A methyltransferase activity requires further studies in vitro.
In trypanosomes, the first adenine of the hypermethylated cap4 structure is not only methylated at the ribose, but also dimethylated at the N 6 position, to form m 6, 6 Am. The methyltransferase responsible for the latter reaction remains unknown. 11 Further, the fourth uracil in that structure is modified to m 3 U, and the enzyme responsible for this modification also remains unknown.
The g-methylphosphate cap structure is unique in that it is an alternative to the guanosine-containing cap. It is formed by a single methyltransfer reaction to a g -phosphate oxygen at the 5 0 end of the primary transcripts of certain small RNA molecules such as mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2 and plant U3. 74 The enzyme responsible for this reaction, Bicoid-interacting protein 3 (Bin3), is a methyltransferase conserved in eukaryotes. It is, however, absent from S. cerevisiae. 75, 76 A structure of the human Bin3 homolog (BCDIN3) was determined, revealing a conserved RFM core (Fig. 5 ). An enzyme-substrate complex is not yet available, and the details of protein-RNA recognition and the mechanism of discrimination between Bin3 substrates and non-substrates remain to be determined. Trimethylguanosine synthase catalyzes hypermethylation of cap0 structure. In a 2step reaction, 2 methyl groups are transferred to the amine group of m 7 G and, as a result, the m 2,2,7 G structure is formed. The crystal structure of human TGS1 methyltransferase in complex with m 7 Gppp and SAH (shown in stick representation) is deposited in the PDB as 3GDH. Secondary structure elements that correspond to elements of the conserved RFM core are labeled. Secondary structure elements outside of the conserved core are not labeled.
In recent years significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of formation of different RNA cap structures. This progress has been driven in particular by the identification and characterization of novel methyltransferases that take part in cap biosynthesis, and by the determination of their crystal structures. This knowledge also has a practical dimension, as the capping process is essential for eukaryotic cells as well as for the life cycle of viruses that infect them. In this context, the difference between the structures of the human enzymes and the enzymes from human pathogens could be exploited to develop new drugs. In particular, viruses that evolved alternative enzymes to synthesize the same cap structures as are synthesized by human cellular machinery are attractive targets for the development of inhibitors that could specifically block viral methyltransferases.
To date, numerous high-resolution structures of viral RNA capping enzymes have been determined, in particular for cap methyltransferases from various flaviviruses, which have been considered an attractive new antiviral target. 77 Based on knowledge of structures, efforts have been made toward the identification of specific inhibitors of these enzymes. For instance, a structure-based search for new inhibitors was performed for the dengue virus methyltransferase. [78] [79] [80] [81] The development of compounds that specifically inhibit viral methyltransferases will be aided by the recent structure determination of the catalytic domain of the human cap1 methyltransferase, which shares the global architecture, but exhibits a different cap-binding site compared to the viral enzymes. 39 The human cap1 methyltransferase appears to be essential and cannot be knocked out in human cells (our unpublished data), therefore the development of inhibitors specific against that human enzyme could be also useful as tools to study the cellular function of cap1 methylation.
The study on the process of SL RNA maturation in trypanosomal parasites could benefit from structure analysis of trypanosomal methyltransferases. While the cap0 and cap1 methyltransferases in trypanosomes are relatively closely related to their human counterparts, bioinformatics analyses identified cap2 and cap3/4 methyltransferases as close homologs of the vaccinia virus cap1 methyltransferase. While the analysis of protein-RNA interactions and search for potential regulatory molecules (e.g., inhibitors) could be guided by homology models developed so far, 47 experimental determination of high resolution structures for cap methyltransferases in trypanosomes would be definitely useful.
A complete understanding of RNA cap biosynthesis requires not only structure determination of the enzymes that are well characterized biochemically, but also the identification of the genes and proteins that encode the cap methylation machinery. Some of the prominent enzymatic activities known to exist that are still awaiting unequivocal identification of the corresponding proteins include m 6 A methylation of the first transcribed nucleoside of capped RNAs in humans, and m 6,6 A and m 3 U methylation of the first and the fourth residues in the cap4 structure in capped RNAs in trypanosomes. A comprehensive biochemical and structural characterization of these enzymes could further contribute to the possibility of developing new drugs against trypanosomal parasites and new tools to study RNA metabolism in human cells.

171,51485c1b5e3ce7050422a81c6a16ed00faa768fd,"Introduction: Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte imbalance seen in clinical practice, and a common laboratory finding in children with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). This study aimed to identify the incidence of hyponatraemia in cases of CAP, to find predictive tools in order to classify the severity and outcome of CAP and to explore possible differences of clinical importance between the two sexes. Material and methods: The medical files of 54 children (66.4% males), 4.67 ±2.88 years old, were retro-prospectively reviewed. Results: 35/54 (64.8%) children with pneumonia had normal values of sodium at admission, 18/54 (33.3%) had mild hyponatraemia and 1 child (1.9%) moderate hyponatraemia. Increased heart rhythm and tachypnoea at admission were correlated with lower values of sodium (z = -2.664, p = 0.007 and z = -1.705, p = 0.089 respectively). No differences were found between the two sexes concerning the characteristics of pneumonia or the range of sodium in serum at admission. A correlation was found between sodium admission values and: a) C-reactive protein (p = 0.000), and b) leukocyte count (p = 0.006). Sedimentation rate (p = 0.021) was also considered as a possible risk factor affecting the value of sodium at admission to hospital. Finally, a negative association was also observed between the degree of hyponatraemia and the duration of hospitalization (z = -3.398, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Although studies in larger population groups are needed, in our study increased heart rhythm, tachypnoea, leucocyte count, C-reactive protein, and also erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be considered as possible risk factors influencing the degree of hyponatraemia, and thus the outcome of hospitalized children with CAP.","Hyponatraemia (HN, serum sodium < 135 mEq/l) is the most common electrolyte imbalance seen in clinical practice, and also in critically ill children [1] . It is present in approximately 3% of hospitalized patients [2] . Mild to moderate HN and severe hyponatraemia are found in 15-30% and 1-4% of hospitalized patients, respectively [3] .
Pathophysiologically, HNs are classified into two groups: HN due to nonosmotic hyper-secretion of vasopressin (hypovolaemic, hypervolaemic, euvolaemic) and HN of non-hypervasopressinaemic origin (pseudohyponatraemia, water intoxication, cerebral salt wasting syndrome) [3] .
First, in 1920 it was shown that many children with pneumonia retain water [4] , which has been found to be associated with an increased blood volume and a low plasma chloride value [5] . These findings are explained by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH), which has been described in children with pneumonia [6] , and meningitis [7] . It was found that HN frequently accompanies pulmonary diseases, infectious and also neoplastic [8] .
Hyponatraemia is considered a common laboratory finding in children with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), which can be defined clinically as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child due to an infection which has been acquired outside hospital [9] . Few studies, though, explore the correlation of HN and pneumonia in children [10] . Based on the published studies, the severity of CAP and HN due to CAP are associated with the need of hospitalization, the presence of prolonged and high fever, and elevated serum non-specific inflammatory markers, such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum procalcitonin [9] .
Moreover, lower respiratory infections (LRIs), including acute lower respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), continue to threaten the health of children worldwide and especially in developing countries, where poor nutrition prevails and access to health care is scarce [11] .
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of hyponatraemia in children with CAP, to find predictive tools in order to classify the severity and outcome of CAP and also to explore possible differences of clinical importance between the two sexes.
The files of children hospitalized due to pneumonia in the 2 nd Department of Paediatrics, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, were retroprospectively reviewed. Participants in the study were chosen randomly from those that were hospitalized from January 2008 to May 2009. Information on sociodemographic variables including child's age and gender, and also clinical features of pneumonia, such as the presence and duration of fever, cough, nasal congestion, thoracic or abdominal pain and the duration of hospitalization were also recorded. Moreover, laboratory examinations, including nonspecific markers of inflammation, such as white blood cells (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP, and also biochemical exa minations (including electrolytes, liver and kidney function) were performed in order to find possible predictors of pneumonia's severity and outcome. In order to be more specific sodium (Na), potassium (K), urea (Ur), creatinine (Cr), glucose (Glu), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transa minase (SGPT) were measured. Moreover, laboratory examinations were done at the admission of the child to the hospital, irrespective of the time of admission.
Since there was no control group to correlate our findings, the study group was subdivided into two groups based on patients' gender.
Hyponatraemia was defined as a sodium level of < 135 mmol/l in serum [12, 13] . The severity of HN was determined by the reports of Ellison and Berl [8] . Serum concentration of 131-135 mmol/l means mild HN, 126-130 mmol/l means moderate HN, and ≤ 125 mmol/l means severe HN [2] . Hypernatraemia was defined as a serum sodium concentration > 145 mmol/l [2] .
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 12.00 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL). Frequencies and descriptive statistics were used primarily in order to describe the sample's overall attitudes. The distribution of the population in various groups was described by mean value ± standard error (SE). χ 2 test and Fisher's exact test were used for qualitative variables in order to calculate p values, while regression analysis was used for quantitative variables.
Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for normally distributed variables, while the Mann-Whitney test was used for variables not normally distributed. Values of p < 0.05 were considered as significant.
The study population consisted of 54 children, 0.20-12.0 years old (mean ± SE: 4.67 ±0.39 years). There were 32 males (59.25%) and 22 females (40.75%). The duration of their hospitalization was 2.0-15.0 days (mean ± SE: 5.42 ±0.42 days). The majority of them presented cough (44/54, 81.50%), and fever (53/54, 98.15%). Admission body temperature was variable, ranging between 36.2°C and 41.0°C (mean ± SE: 37.96 ±0.17°C). Fever was present for 0-15 days (4.24 ±0.43 days) before entrance to the hospital, and lasted for 0.0-11.0 days (2.75 ±0.27 days) after admission day. Moreover, cough was present 0.0-10.0 days before hospitalization (mean ± SE: 4.10 ±0.43 days) in children with pneumonia. Nasal congestion and abdominal pain were described in about one third of them (16/54, 29.60% and 17/54, 31.50% respectively). Thoracic pain and vomiting were recorded only in 9/54 (16.70%) and 5/54 (9.25%) of them respectively. One third of the children with pneumonia had previously received antibiotics (18/54, 33.33%). Seven children developed pleural effusion. The outcome of all patients was favourable. Laboratory values of both sexes are presented in Table I. There were no statistically significant differences between age of hospitalized children with pneumonia and their sex (p = 0.25) or the presence of abdominal pain (p = 0.27). However, older children (mean age ± SE: 6.93 ±1.11 years) more often (p = 0.01) present thoracic pain compared with younger ones (mean age ± SE: 4.22 ±0.38 years). Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between the duration of hospitalization and the presence of thoracic (r = -0.96, p = 0.33) or abdominal pain (z = -1.04, p = 0.29).
A correlation was found between the duration of hospitalization: a) and the duration of fever after admission (p = 0.004), and b) the value of CRP at admission (p = 0.00). There was also a correlation between the value of serum sodium at admission and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.02).
Furthermore, CRP value and leukocyte count were correlated with admission value of sodium in serum (p = 0.00 and p = 0.006 respectively). Finally, there was a negative association between the degree of hyponatraemia and the length of hospitalization (z = -3.39, p = 0.001).
Correlations were also performed between the two sexes concerning their age, days of hospitalization, body temperature at admission (°C), duration of fever before and after admission, duration of cough, respiratory and heart rate at admission, SatO 2 (%) and the value of serum sodium at admission. No statistically significant differences between the two groups were found (Table II) .
Hyponatraemia could result from a sodium deficit, or surplus of water. Primary illness, impaired water excretion, ""inappropriate"" release of vasopressin, use of hypotonic fluids, redistribution of sodium and water, sickle cell syndrome, and several drugs may contribute to hyponatraemia [3, 14] .
Hyponatraemia is a frequent finding in children with pneumonia. Usually, it comprises part of the syndrome of inappropriate SIADH [10, 15, 16] . Secretion of anti-diuretic hormone typically results in water retention with minimal weight gain, usually with no oedema formation, and normal blood pressure [10] . According to studies, SIADH occurs in about one third of children hospitalized for pneumonia, and was associated with a more severe disease and a poorer outcome [10] . Few studies exist concerning the correlation of HN and pneumonia in children. It was first described by Stormont and Waterhouse in 1962 [17] . Since then and during the past 35 years, only case reports and a few relevant studies on the association between HN and pneumonia have been published, of which only three concern children [10, 18, 19] . Community-acquired (CAP) and nosocomial pneumonias contribute substantially to morbidity and hospital resource utilization [20, 21] . Hyponatraemia, occurring in more than 1/4 of patients with CAP, is associated with greater disease severity and worsened outcomes [20] .
In the present study, only 33.33% of children had mild hyponatraemia and 1 child (1.90%) moderate HN. Moreover, children with more severe HN had a longer duration of hospitalization (z = -3.40, p = 0.001), findings that are consistent with previously published data [20] .
Hyponatraemia is usually mild in children with CAP [9] . It seems that high atrial natriuretic peptide levels (ANP) may play a role [15] . Atrial natriuretic peptide is a member of the family of natriuretic peptides, and regulates a variety of physiological parameters, such as diuresis and natriuresis, and reduces systemic blood pressure. It is synthesized and secreted from cardiac atria [15] . Increased levels of ANP were found in diseases affecting the lungs. Over-secretion of ANP is correlated with hypoxia, which leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary hypertension, and right-heart overload [22, 23] .
Severe HN is rare in children with CAP, as in our study where only one child presented a moderate degree of HN (1%). This can be explained by the observations of Haviv et al. [15] . According to them, the ANP through its natriuretic, diuretic and vasodilatatory effects may contribute in maintaining water and electrolyte balance in children with pneumonia and SIADH. Gerigk et al. [24] found that ADH may cause HN that may originate by a nonosmotic, cardiovascular mechanism in acutely ill children, including children with pneumonia.
Based on studies, symptoms and signs indicative of severe pneumonia were two to three times more frequent and the mean duration of tachypnoea, chest wall retraction and hospital stay about 50% longer in children with HN [10] . In the present study, children with increased heart rhythm and tachypnoea at admission presented lower values of sodium (z = -2.66, p = 0.007 and z = -1.70, p = 0.089 respectively).
The analysis of non-specific inflammatory markers (CRP, WBC, ESR) has shown a significant association between the presence of HN and elevated levels of WBC [9] . A significant association also exists between HN and fever, increased WBC count and CRP levels and the need for hospital treatment. All these parameters reflect the severity of pneumonia, but without taking into consideration the radiological pattern of pneumonia or the length of hospital stay and the aetiological agent [9, 25] .
In our study there was also a correlation between leukocyte count (z = -2.010, p = 0.04), sedimentation rate (z = -2.42, p = 0.01), CRP (z = -3.76, p = 0.00), and levels of sodium at admission to hospital. It should be pointed out that no statistical associations were analysed between PCT and other factors/markers, since only in a few children with pneumonia (fewer than ten) was PCT measured at admission to the hospital.
Hyponatraemia, the most common frequent electrolyte derangement identified among hospitalized patients, is associated with worsened outcomes in patients with pneumonia, heart failure and other disorders [26] . Hyponatraemia is common among hospitalized patients with pneumonia and is associated with worsened clinical and economic outcomes and indicates a poor prognosis [20, 25] . A recent single-centre cohort study found the incidence of HN at hospital admission among CAP patients to be 28% [26] . It is important to emphasize that the presence of HN was associated with not only prolongation of hospitalization (HLOS), but also with an increase in hospital mortality [20] . In our study, children with HN at admission had longer hos pitalization times and a prolonged duration of fever, although their final outcome was favourable, including cases that developed pleural effusion.
Although no differences were found in our study between the two sexes concerning the characteristics of pneumonia or the range of serum sodium at admission (Table II) , it is important to emphasize the originality of our study since no data exist as far as we could find by checking electronic resources on this topic.
In conclusion, our findings further confirm the fact that mild HN is common among hospitalized patients with pneumonia and influences hospital length of stay. Thus, it contributes to increased morbidity rates and probably adds to the costs of care. However, a limitation of the study was the relatively small size of our study group, since only one child with pneumonia had moderate HN. Thus, studies in larger population groups are needed in order to evaluate whether the degree of HN could impact the outcome of hospitalized children with CAP and whether sex is a risk factor for the development of HN in cases of children with pneumonia.
The evaluation of the severity of CAP should include clinical markers, such as heart rate and respiratory rate, and also biochemical indexes, such as leukocyte count, ESR, CRP and serum levels of sodium.

172,4b34166a75b4835a2743fabba60bf7ff23cf0087,"Rationale: Denatonium benzoate is a useful indicator to ensure that the respirator being used by an individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect against unwanted airborne exposure. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable.
Patient concerns: A 34-year-old female nurse rapidly developed shortness of breath, cough, and agitation after denatonium benzoate fit testing. She had a history of allergy to shrimp, crab, mite, and disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium).
Diagnoses: Due to typical symptoms of asthma after exposure to denatonium benzoate aerosol without any other apparent cause, serial pulmonary function tests indicating obstructive lung function and a higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E, she was diagnosed with allergic asthma.
Interventions: This patient was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, b 2 agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler.
Outcomes: The patient showed quick responses after treatment with diphenhydramine (intramuscularly), fenoterol HBr (inhalation), and prednisolone (oral). Approximately 2 weeks later, she suffered from difficulty breathing and asthmatic symptoms again when she was exposed to polished wax and disinfectant. She was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, b 2 agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. The patient was in stable condition with improvement in symptoms during follow-up.
Lessons: There may be potentially important health risks when healthcare workers are exposed to denatonium benzoate. Individuals who have a history of allergy to disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium) should avoid exposure of denatonium benzoate. More advanced research is needed in the future.
Abbreviations: ASM = airway smooth muscle, HCWs = healthcare workers, IgE = immunoglobulin antibody E, SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome.","Denatonium benzoate is a useful indicator to ensure that the respirator being used by an individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect against unwanted airborne exposure. [1] During the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan in 2003, [2] a significant number of the infected subjects were healthcare workers (HCWs) who contracted the SARS infection from their patients. For the prevention of airborne infections, many HCWs in hospitals have been fit tested for respirator use as a part of respiratory protection programs since 2003. [2, 3] The main purpose of fit testing is to ensure that the respirator being used by the individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect the person from unwanted airborne hazard exposures. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable. [3] Under these circumstances, the health consequences for individuals given denatonium benzoate become an important issue. We report a case that required hospitalization for a severe asthmatic reaction related to denatonium benzoate fit testing.
A 34-year-old female nurse worked at a regional hospital for 3 years before hospitalization with severe asthma. She was healthy prior to the assignment to join the respirator fit testing program at 5 PM on October 13, 2017. She had a history of allergy to shrimp, crab, mite, and disinfecting products (contain quaternary ammonium). Skin rash and itching were noted when she contacted disinfectants (containing quaternary ammonium). She had no family history of asthma. She denied previous major illness or abuse of alcohol and drugs, including over-the-counter medications. She rapidly developed shortness of breath, cough, and agitation after the 1st part of the respirator fit test. Respirator fit testing was performed using the 3M Fit Test Kit FT-31 (3M Canada Company, Ontario, Canada) (denatonium benzoate solution). [4] In the procedure for the respirator fit testing program, [5] the 1st part of the test is to screen the ability of the examinee to detect (taste) aerosolized droplets of a dilute solution of denatonium benzoate; then the examinee wears the respirator for the 2nd part of the test, and a more concentrated solution of the denatonium benzoate is sprayed into the hood while the individual performs a set of actions. The test criterion of the respirator fit test is the failure to taste the denatonium benzoate by the examinee. [4, 6] Upon physical examination, she appeared dyspneic. A few scattered rales and wheezing sounds were heard upon examination of the lungs. The heart was of normal size with a heart rate of 119 beats/min and a regular sinus rhythm, her blood pressure was 167/110 mm Hg, her respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min and her temperature was 36.6°C. The abdomen was soft. The liver and spleen were not palpable. An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 78 beats/min. The echocardiogram showed fatty liver and gallstones, with no heart dysfunction. A chest roentgenogram revealed negative findings: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ; observed/predicted = 1.60/2.64 L), forced vital capacity (FVC; observed/predicted = 2.34/3.00 L), FEV 1 /FVC (68%), and FVC (78%), indicating obstructive lung function. Multiple blood cultures were negative. No parasite ova were found in stool specimens. Other relevant laboratory investigations are summarized in Table 1 . Serial spirometry tests were conducted on December 11, 2017 (FEV 1 = 2.11/2.64 L, FVC = 2.34/3.02 L, FEV 1 /FVC = 91%) and January 15, 2018 (FEV 1 = 2.12/2.65 L, FVC = 2.34/3.00 L, FEV 1 /FVC = 91%).
On October 13, 2017, she was hospitalized and initially treated with diphenhydramine 30 mg st (intramuscularly), fenoterol HBr 100 mg st and prn (inhalation), and prednisolone 10 mg/daily (oral) for 7 days. The symptoms of dyspnea improved. She was discharged in stable condition and sent to rest at home with continuous treatment of Symbicort turbuhaler 140/4.5 mg prn on October 19, 2017.
At 8 AM on October 31, 2017, she returned to the hospital for duty when her condition was stable. At 11 AM, the cleaners performed a cleaning task in the nurse station with disinfectant (active ingredients: isopropanol, disbutylphenoxyethyl dimethethy benzyl ammonium chloride, and inert ingredient) and waxed the floor. At 12 AM, she suffered from difficulty breathing and asthmatic symptoms again when she was exposed to the polished wax and disinfectant. She was rushed to the emergency room and treated with prednisolone 10 mg daily, fenoterol HBr 100 mg (inhalation), and montelukast 10 mg daily. Unfortunately, the asthmatic symptoms persisted. She was referred to a medical center hospital in southern Taiwan for further outpatient management. Omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid and b 2 agonist, and montelukast were administered in the hospital outpatient department. Amelioration of dyspnea was noted in the following days.
Being a case report, our institution does not require formal ethical approval. Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying image.
In this case, asthma related to denatonium benzoate was diagnosed for several reasons: the patient exhibited typical symptoms of asthma without any other apparent cause, the spectrum of symptoms was consistent with previous clinical descriptions of asthma and rapid onset of asthmatic symptoms after exposure of denatonium benzoate aerosol, [7] the results of serial pulmonary function tests showed obstructive lung function, and a higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E (IgE) (516.3 IU/mL) was noted (Table 1) .
Taste is one of the senses through which humans and other animals perceive their environment. [6] The taste function is multidimensional. Qualitatively, the primary taste is bitter, a sensation that comes from specific chemicals that are detected by specialized receptors in the tongue, as well as other parts of the oral cavity. However, when most people refer to taste, they actually imply flavor. [6, 8] Flavors can be considered the perceptual integration of signals from the gustatory, olfactory, and trigeminal systems. [8] Denatonium benzoate is a quaternary ammonium compound that has been used as a denaturant since 1960. [9, 10] Denatonium benzoate is a very bitter substance and is detected by taste at a dilution of 1 part per 20 million parts water. [9, 10] The expression of the bitter taste receptor (TAS2Rs) on human airway smooth muscle (ASM) is considered an avoidance receptor for inhalants that, when activated, leads to ASM contraction and bronchospasm. [11] Adverse reactions related to denatonium benzoate are rare. A previous report [10] revealed a case with a severe allergic reaction, Table 1 Findings of the laboratory investigation of the asthma patient. including urticaria and asthma, resulting from exposure to denatonium benzoate. Another study [3] in Canada presented several cases related to the use of denatonium benzoate for respirator fit testing. Among them, the reactions of several cases were likely due to an irritant effect; others were more consistent with angioedema and asthmatic episodes; and some of the adverse effects may have been more psychologic than toxicologic in nature. Individual susceptibility to denatonium benzoate may play a role in adverse reactions. [3, 11] Previous studies have shown an association between disinfectants and asthma. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The disinfectants, quaternary ammonium compounds (such as benzalkonium chloride), amine compounds, and fragrances are the main sensitizers presented in cleaning products. Bleach (sodium hypochlorite), hydrochloric acid, and alkaline agents (ammonia and sodium hydroxide), which are commonly mixed together, are considered the strongest airway irritants in cleaning products. [11, 12, 13, 15] Exposure to the ingredients of cleaning products may give rise to both new-onset asthma, with or without a latency period, and workexacerbated asthma. [12, 13] Although it has been indicated that in many workers, respiratory tract symptoms induced by chemicals and fragrances cannot be explained by allergic or asthmatic reactions, these patients may have hyperactivity to inhaled irritants, which is known to reflect sensory reactivity. [12] [13] [14] Our case had a higher level of IgE (516.3 IU/mL). It is likely a reflection of atopic features that already result from a known history of allergy to disinfectants. Similar to previous studies, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] the clinical presentations of this case may be due to an asthma exacerbation through exposure to irritants or sensitization to denatonium benzoate.
The limitation of this study was that there was no specific patch testing, specific inhalation challenge, and specific IgE measurements with the ingredient of denatonium benzoate because the survival of this patient was the priority. However, the temporal relationship between the patient with asthmatic symptoms and exposure to denatonium benzoate is quite clear. It might be deduced that the patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing began when she was exposed to denatonium benzoate.
In summary, this case indicates that there may be potentially significant health risks associated with denatonium benzoatebased fit testing, at least for a specific group of susceptible individuals. Individuals who have a history of allergy to disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium) should avoid exposure of denatonium benzoate. More advanced research is required in the future.",Asthma associated with denatonium benzoate in a healthcare worker in Taiwan: A case report,"Chen, Kou-Huang; Chung, Kuo-Mou; Chung, Ju-Hui; Chen, Kow-Tong",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6571374/,276,1492,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
175,d2685fbd92927824244e9d90a145f59f44317db0,"The SNP rs12252-C allele alters the function of interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 increasing the disease severity of influenza virus infection in Caucasians, but the allele is rare. However, rs12252-C is much more common in Han Chinese. Here we report that the CC genotype is found in 69% of Chinese patients with severe pandemic influenza A H1N1/09 virus infection compared with 25% in those with mild infection. Specifically, the CC genotype was estimated to confer a sixfold greater risk for severe infection than the CT and TT genotypes. More importantly, because the risk genotype occurs with such a high frequency, its effect translates to a large population-attributable risk of 54.3% for severe infection in the Chinese population studied compared with 5.4% in Northern Europeans. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 genetic variants could, therefore, have a strong effect of the epidemiology of influenza in China and in people of Chinese descent.","T here is strong evidence that the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) protein is a virus restriction factor mediating cellular resistance to influenza viruses and other viruses that enter cells via the acidic endosome [1] [2] [3] . The importance of IFITM3 in influenza virus infection was determined by Everitt et al. 4 who showed that severity of influenza virus infection was greatly increased in IFITM3 knockout mice compared with wild-type animals. In humans, the rare SNP rs12252-C allele of IFITM3 truncates the protein, leading to reduced restriction of virus replication in vitro 4, 5 . In Northern European patients infected and hospitalized with seasonal influenza or pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09 (pH1N1/09) virus, there was an increased homozygosity of the minor C allele of SNP rs12252 in IFITM3 (5.7 versus 0.3%, n ¼ 53). This was the first direct evidence for a host genetic influence on influenza severity in humans. However, because of the rarity of the susceptibility allele (minor allele frequency ¼ 0.034) in people of Northern European descent, the overall effect on the severity of pandemic or seasonal influenza virus in the population is likely to be small. However, the frequency of the IFITM3 rs12252 susceptibility allele is known to be much higher in Han Chinese (minor allele frequency ¼ 0.5).
Here we examine the influence of this polymorphism on severity of influenza A virus infection in Chinese patients. We found a striking high frequency of the CC genotype among patients in China infected by the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus with severe illness compared with mild infection and the healthy Han Chinese. This implies that the presence of the variant IFITM3 gene influences disease severity rather than susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, using statistic analysis tools, we estimated that patients with the CC genotype have a sixfold greater risk of severe infection compared with those with the CT and TT genotype. The much higher level of CC allele at population level in Han Chinese compared with Caucasians may place the Chinese at a higher risk for developing severe illness upon influenza virus infection.
Clinical and laboratory characteristics of study subjects. During the 2009 pandemic, hospitals in China admitted patients with severe infection, but also, unusually, patients with mild infection, who under normal circumstances would not require hospitalization. This 'open-door' policy provided a unique opportunity to capture a relatively unselected group of patients with divergent outcomes, observed and managed under similar clinical conditions. In this cohort, 83 patients fulfilled the criteria for inclusion (influenza pdmH1N1/09 infection confirmed by viral genome PCR assay, able to give informed consent) and exclusion (use of corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressants for 1 month before or during sampling, coexisting illnesses, pregnancy, positive bacterial cultures from respiratory tract secretions/sputum or blood at any point during hospital admission). Blood was obtained 2 or 3 days after admission and the progress of patients was observed throughout the duration of their hospital stay. At the point of discharge, patients were divided into those with 'mild' and 'severe' disease by perusal of the clinical data over the entire course of their stay. Mild disease (n ¼ 51) was defined as those who reported symptoms (fever, cough, headache and lethargy) only, and whose circulating leukocyte profile (total leukocyte, lymphocytes and neutrophils) was normal throughout the hospital stay. Patients with severe disease (n ¼ 32) were those who reported the symptoms described above, but deteriorated and developed pneumonic consolidation and/or bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph with or without respiratory failure (defined as PaO 2 /FiO 2 o200 mm Hg), or respiratory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or renal failure (only 1 of the 32 patients). All the patients (32/32) in severe group used Oseltamivir, and 38/51 of patients in mild group were given Oseltamivir. No patients developed pleural effusion or empyema. Six patients were mechanically ventilated and all of these were among the thirteen severely infected patients who died. Demographic data are shown in Table 1 .
The C allele at SNP 12252 was associated with disease severity. We sequenced 300 base pairs of the IFITM3 locus encompassing SNP rs12252 in these 83 pH1N1/09 infected individuals. Of these, 42.17% carried the CC genotype, a higher frequency than in the Han Chinese in the 1,000 genomes sequence database (25.38% CC genotype; (P ¼ 0.0001, w 2 -test)) ( Table 2 , Fig. 1a and b). We then stratified hospitalized patients into mild and severe, based on clinical assessment (Table 1) . Mildly ill individuals did not have significantly different allele frequencies compared with the Fig.  1b and c). Ten of the thirteen patients who died carried the CC genotype.
The recessive model has the largest odds ratio. We analysed the association of rs12252 with severe infection by comparing against the mildly infected individuals assuming different genetic models (Table 3) . We could explicitly assess whether one (dominant) or two copies (recessive) of the C allele increase risk of severe infection, as well as whether the risk increase is significant assuming multiplicative (r-fold increase for CT, r 2 for CC genotype) or additive models (r-fold increase for CT, 2r-fold for CC genotype). All models apart from the dominant model show significant association to severe infection with the recessive model having the largest odds ratio. In particular, under the multiplicative model, the carriers of the C allele showed a threefold increase in risk for severe infection compared with carriers of the T allele (multiplicative model P-value ¼ 7.936 Â 10 À 4 , odds ratio ¼ 3.42, 95% confidence interval 1.63-7.17). Under the recessive model, homozygotes for the C allele were estimated to have a larger, sixfold greater risk for severe infection compared with heterozygotes and homozygotes for the T allele (recessive Elevated serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in patients with CC genotype. Together these analyses suggest that the CC variant does not increase the chance of initial virus infection but is associated with severity of the illness, although a larger study including another population is required to prove this definitively. The cytokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is elevated in several viral infections and levels were raised in the lungs of IFTIM3 knockout mice after influenza virus infection 4 . When we grouped the patients by IFTIM3 genotype, we found significantly elevated serum levels of MCP-1 in the patients with the CC genotype compared with patients with CT or TT genotype (P ¼ 0.002) (Fig. 2a) . We also found a higher level of influenza A pH1N1/09-specific antibodies in patients with the CC genotype (P ¼ 0.04) (Fig. 2b) . These data indicate that the CC genotype is associated with a more overt immune response possibly due to higher viral (antigen) load. We did not observe any significant differences in T-cell responses, measured by interferon-gamma ELISpot assays with peptides spanning the whole virus proteome, between patients with and without the CC genotype (Fig. 2c ).
Our data show that the IFITM3-SNP, rs12252 is associated with disease severity following influenza virus infection in the Chinese population. IFITM3 restricts the replication of influenza virus infection in humans and mice; however, IFITM3 CC homozygotes are more likely to suffer severe respiratory pathology in both UK Caucasians and Han Chinese. Larger scale studies are urgently required to determine whether genotyping for IFITM3-sn12252 in Han Chinese and other Asian patients infected with influenza virus can predict those who might progress to severe disease early in their infection. In these it might be possible to improve their prognosis by early intensification of their treatment. In addition, genotyping should be considered when selecting patients for clinical trials and for studies of influenza virus infection, especially those involving virus challenges with a low pathogenic virus. SNP typing in China costs BUS$8 per sample, and this could be done in most large hospital laboratories.
The IFITM3 effect is not dependent on influenza virus subtype, restricting both influenza A and B viruses 4 . In this study, we showed an effect on severity of a low pathogenic influenza A virus in humans. For a more pathogenic virus such as the avian H5N1 influenza virus that has a high fatality rate (59%) 6 , it is possible that the CC genotype could enhance the disease or that the virulent virus overrides the usual protective effects of the CT and TT genotypes. This will need further study. Future studies will also ask whether the disease course differs between severely infected patients who have the CC genotype and those with the CT or TT genotypes.
It is intriguing that the CC genotype 4 is rare in Northern Europeans and common in Asian populations. As many other viral infections are restricted by IFITM3 in vitro, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Dengue virus and West Nile virus 1,7 the high population allele frequencies may have been influenced by complex virus exposures.
An estimate of how many individuals would develop severe infection specifically due to their CC genotype is given by the population-attributable risk (PAR). This largely depends on the frequency of the risk genotype in the population. As the risk genotype occurs at high frequency in the Chinese population, its effect translates into a large PAR, accounting for 54.25% of severe infection. This is much larger than the corresponding PAR of 5.39% in Northern Europeans, and implies that the incidence of severe influenza infection might be higher in Chinese than in Northern Europeans. This should be explored in future epidemiological studies.
In conclusion, our data clearly extend the earlier observation in a European cohort that the IFTM3-rs12252CC genotype is significantly associated with influenza severity. The association is primarily with severity of disease rather than susceptibility to infection, although larger studies are required to prove this specific association. IFITM3 may have an important role in virus replication and dissemination following the initial infection. The much higher level of the CC genotype in the Han Chinese population compared with Caucasians may place the Chinese at a higher risk for developing severe illness upon influenza infection. It is not known whether those who are more severely infected with influenza virus are more likely to spread the infection. If this is the case, the high frequency of the C allele in Asian populations may influence the epidemiology of influenza. Sequencing and genotyping of rs12252. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cell using the PureGene DNA Isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The region encompassing the human IFITM3 rs12252 sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The amplification was performed using the following forward and reverse primers: 5 0 -GGAAACTG TTGAGAAACCGAA-3 0 and 5 0 -CATACGCACCTTCACGGAGT-3 0 (Beijing Institute of Genomics(BGI),Shenzhen, China). The PCR products were purified and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyser (GATC Biotech). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified using Chromas (Technelysium Pty Ltd) at the BGI, Shenzhen, China.
MCP-1 quantification. EDTA-separated serum was stored at À 80 1C until analysis. MCP-1 was analysed using a Human Cytokine multiplex assay (Bio-Rad, USA) and Luminex multi-analytic profiling technology (Bio-Rad, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously 8 . In brief, serum samples were diluted 1 in 4 with sample diluent, while standards were reconstituted in standard diluent. Standards and samples were incubated with the magnetic beads in a 96-well plate for 30 min at room temperature. After this, detection antibody was added to each well, and incubated at room temperature for a further 30 min. Streptavidin-PE was used as the fluorochrome for antibody detection. Using Bio-Plex Manager software version 6.0, standard Luminex maintenance procedures were performed, and Bio-Plex CAL1 and CAL2 beads were used to calibrate the system.
Haemagglutination inhibition assay. Antibody titres in the serum samples were determined by haemagglutination inhibition assay as described previously 9 . In brief, the serum samples were treated with receptor destroying enzyme from Vibrio cholerae by diluting one part serum with three parts enzyme and were incubated overnight in a 37 1C water bath and then were heat-inactivated at 56 Ex vivo interferon-c ELISpot assay. 12-16 h interferon-g ELISpot assays were performed using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as described previously 10 . Two lakh fifty thousand PBMCs were used in each ELISpot well in the final volume of 100 ml. The end concentration of peptide in each well was 2-3.5 mM when testing peptide pools and 2 mM when testing individual peptides. For negative and positive controls, PBMCs were incubated with media alone and with phytohemagglutinin (Wellcome), respectively. Spot forming units (SFU) were counted using an automated ELISpot reader (AID). Responses were considered positive when the number of SFU per well was greater than three times the average negative control value for the given assay, and four times the mean negative control value obtained from the peptide pool screening of all participants. Adjusted SFU after subtracting average negative values were expressed as SFUs per 1,000,000 PBMCs.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of genetic data was performed using the w 2 -test and the R-stats library in the R-Statistical package 11 . For association testing under different genetic models, Fisher's exact test was additionally used since the w 2 approximation might not hold for small samples. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to test for association under the additive genetic model. Association of rs12252 to severe infection was assessed by analysing the severe infected individuals against the mildly infected individuals. The latter do not show significant differences with the Han population from 1,000 Genomes project and represent a better population-matched group for the severe infected samples. The odd ratios calculated for the association of a specific risk allele (or genotype) reflects the relative risks of the risk allele given that the incidence of severe infection is observed to be sufficiently low. PAR was estimated under the assumption that the frequency of the risk genotype (CC) in the mildly infected individuals reflected the genotype population frequency. The formula used for the PAR calculation is: PAR% ¼ 100 Â p (RR À 1)/ [p (RR À 1) þ 1], where p represents the risk genotype frequency in the population and RR represents the relative risk of the risk genotype (CC). For the calculation of the PAR for the Northern Europeans, the genotype counts of hospitalized patients and North European populations from 1,000 Genomes project were used as given in Everitt et al. 4 All other statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism v 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Independent samples t-test were used where data were normally distributed (evaluated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), to compare haemagglutination inhibition levels, age, white blood cells, neutrophil counts and so on between mild and severe disease; Mann-Whitney test was used where the data were not normally distributed (MCP-1). Chi-square tests were employed to analyse the difference of gender, comorbidities, pneumonia and respiratory failure between mild and severe groups.

Co-regulation is a basic mechanism to coordinately control expression of genes in modules, biochemical pathways and protein complexes (1) (2) (3) . In eukaryotes, expression is most often mediated by transcription factors (TFs) that bind upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and recruit the polymerase assembly (4) . TFs bind, with varying affinity, to a set of similar, short (6-20 nt) sequences (5) . Computational binding site discovery focuses on finding significantly overrepresented sequences in upstream regions of co-regulated genes (6) (7) (8) . Thus, computational TFBS prediction algorithms must begin with an input set of promoters from genes hypothetically co-regulated by a shared TF. The algorithms aim to predict the binding positions and consequently the nucleotide specificity of the TF (9) (10) (11) .
The first part of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) discovery, the input set, can be identified using either computational or experimental methods. Experimental techniques, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (12) , have been successfully used to generate a genome scale mapping of approximate TF-binding positions (10, 13, 14) . Computational techniques, such as phylogenetic profiling (15, 16) and artificial neural networks, can also be used to identify sets of co-regulated genes. Both experimental and computational approaches, however, suffer from a significant false positive (FP) prediction rate. Inclusion of extraneous promoters in the input sets dilutes the enrichment of the shared TFBS sequences making computational TFBS discovery significantly more challenging (17) . We term such erroneously included promoters decoy sequences (DSs).
After receiving a set of upstream regions co-regulated by a shared TF as input, computational methods aim to predict the binding positions of that TF (6) (7) (8) 18) . Given a set of input promoters, motif detection algorithms identify a set of short, oligonucleotide segments hypothesized to bind to the TF of interest. The predicted sequences can be used to construct a position weight matrix (PWM) representing the average nucleotide frequencies for each position in the site (19) . Ideally, computational detection will return all sequences that bind to every TF with biologically relevant function in those upstream regions. However, since the source of binding specificity for TFs is not well understood (20) , heuristic approaches and ad hoc multiple alignment based scoring schemes are used to identify locally optimal solutions (17) . Each local optimum that exists in a given set of promoters may correspond to distinctly different motifs, and may score differently relative to each other according to different scoring schemes.
Binding site prediction algorithms are generally confounded by several factors: degeneracy in the binding site; the unknown length of the binding site; the relatively large length of promoters; and the inclusion of DSs in the input sets (17, 21, 22) . As a result as few as 10% of predicted positions correspond to biologically functional binding sites (23) . Due, in part, to the low accuracy rate, computational binding site identification has been of limited use (23) . Problems identifying binding sites are further exacerbated in mammalian genomes by larger promoter regions (24) and scarcity of reliable information on co-regulation of genes. Thus, the most demanding test of efficacy for TFBS identification approaches lies in their application to mammalian systems and subsequent validation of predictions.
Because of computational complexity of the problem, Gibbs sampling is often used to identify binding positions (18) . In this paper, we present a new strategy that clusters Gibbs sampling results at each input nucleotide-a technique we term positional clustering-to improve accuracy of predicted TF binding. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach using known examples of binding and regulation in yeast and experimentally testing predicted TF-binding sites upstream of the subunit genes coding for the heteromeric mammalian neurotransmitter receptor system, the type A g-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA A R).
The GABA A R is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in the central nervous system (CNS) (25, 26) with important roles in development (27, 28) and disease (29) (30) (31) . The receptor is believed to be a pentamer made up of multiple subunits that come from at least four different subunit classes (a, b, g and d) (32) . At least 19 genes code for the various subunits that differentially combine to form numerous pharmacologically distinct GABA A receptor isoforms (29, 30) . Isoform utilization depends in part on the relative abundance of the subunits, which may change under various conditions (33) (34) (35) . Understanding subunit regulatory mechanisms may provide insight into GABA A receptor isoform usage and related phenotypes (36) .
In the current study, we test the ability of positional clustering to detect known TF-binding sites in a series of increasingly noisy sets of yeast promoters, and found marked improvement in the percentage of correct predictions over Gibbs sampling alone. We also present de novo predictions of TF-binding sites in promoter regions of GABA A receptor subunit genes (GABRs) whose expression is altered (either up-regulated or down-regulated) in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy (35) . Positional clustering identified a number of putative cis-regulatory sites, many of which correspond to known binding elements for TFs found in the CNS. Mobility shift assays showed several predicted GABR-binding sequences specifically bind nuclear proteins derived from primary neocortical neurons kept in culture. Furthermore, a particular non-consensus GABR putative regulatory sequence was shown to have a functional role in cultured cortical neurons demonstrating the efficacy of positional clustering in detecting functional regulatory elements in mammals.
We identified S.cerevisiae genes predicted at high confidence (P < 0.001) to be regulated by the TF STE12 in YPD growth media, according to whole-genome TF location data (14) . For the 51 identified genes, we collected upstream intergenic promoters. Intergenic regions were truncated at 1 kb upstream of the gene's TSS.
We selected for study a set of six GABRs: GABRA1, GABRA4, GABRB1, GABRB3, GABRD and GABRE. Promoters were extracted for each gene, including two alternative first exons of the GABRB3 (37), giving a set of seven promoters. The length of each promoter was: GABRA1, 3733 bp; GABRA4, 1546 bp; GABRB1, 1353 bp; GABRB3 (exon 1), 1310 bp; GABRB3 (exon 1A), 2080 bp; GABRD, 6625 bp; and GABRE, 5278 bp. We augmented the input set with orthologous promoters from rat, with the exception of GABRB3 for which an orthologous gene from mouse was used. In total, 14 promoters upstream of six GABRs were selected for analysis.
For a given input set of promoters, we ran the Gibbs sampler BioProspector (8) 400-550 times, evenly distributed across all motifs widths from 6-15 bp. We used a third-order background model derived from appropriate genomic promoters. We collected the best three results from each BioProspector run. We counted the number of times BioProspector identified each nucleotide in the input set. For each promoter, we identified the maximally occurring nucleotide, and extracted all positions identified by BioProspector >35% of the maximum. We clustered together neighboring positions into putative TFBS. As a dust filter, we removed all putative TFBSs <6 bp long ( Figure 1 ).
For sets of S.cerevisiae promoters, we used 1200 results from 400 BioProspector runs in our evaluation. For GABRps, we considered all 127 non-empty subsets of the seven promoters (orthologous sequences were always considered together). We used results from 70 000 BioProspector runs, evenly distributed across all promoter subsets, in our analysis. In addition to dust filtering, we required putative TFBSs to occur both in the human and in the orthologous rodent promoter.
We used positive predictive value,
to evaluate STE12-binding site predictions. We classified predictions as true positive (TP) or false positive (FP) by comparison to the STE12-binding motif, TGAAACA, as determined by (14) . For each sequence, we calculated distance from the known STE12 PWM using a modified local ungapped sequence alignment similar to that in (38) . Alignments were scored as the sum of Pearson's correlation coefficient,
between prediction X and the STE12 PWM across all aligned positions. Thus, scores ranged from zero, with no positions aligned, to seven, the length of the STE12 PWM. We observed a bimodal distribution of scores (Supplementary Figure S1) , and chose the alignment score corresponding to the minima of the distribution (alignment score ¼ 4.5) as the threshold to classify predictions as TP or FP.
We complemented the seed set of 51 STE12-bound promoters with 1-50 randomly chosen yeast promoters. We performed our motif detection procedure on each input set, and compared the PPV of putative TFBS with that of raw BioProspector results ( Figure 2 , solid lines).
To evaluate the background rate of STE12-binding site recovery, we created a seed set of 51 randomly chosen S.cerevisiae promoters. We evaluated the percentage of STE12-like binding sites identified in the random seed set, as well as in versions of the seed set augmented with 1-50 randomly chosen yeast promoters (Figure 2, dashed lines) .
For additional yeast evaluations (HAP4, TEC1, YAP1 and YDR026C), we substituted for BioProspector an in-house implementation of the BioProspector algorithm. Comparisons of results from each implementation show the two implementations to be approximately equivalent.
We ran MotifScanner (39) to search GABR promoters for all vertebrate TF-binding motifs found in TRANSFAC (40) . For each promoter analyzed, we used a prior probability of 0.1 and the corresponding organism specific third-order promoter background model from Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) (41) .We considered positional overlap between Motif-Scanner predictions and putative TFBSs indicative of known binding motifs in our predictions.
Double-stranded oligonucleotides for EMSA contained the following sequences: Nuclear extracts were prepared (42) and used for gel shift analysis after concentration (Microcon no. 10 columns, Amicon, MA). Quantification was performed on EMSAs under conditions that yield a standard curve for band intensity.
Single-stranded sense and antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides for the predicted GGCGGCGTGCACACACACGC-CCACCGCGG binding site are annealed by boiling sense and antisense oligonucleotides for 5 min at equal molar ratios in dH 2 O. Oligos are then cooled to room temperature and placed on ice. Transfections using DOTAP (Roche)/HEPES solutions are performed with oligonucleotides corresponding to wildtype, mutant or with DOTAP (Roche)/HEPES solution lacking oligonucleotides (MOCK) as described in (29) . Effects of oligonucleotide application to neurons are assessed by real-time RT-PCR.
Since TFBS are predicted computationally by local optimization strategies, we evaluate the extent to which one of these strategies, Gibbs sampling, identifies the same set of segments in repeated runs using the same input data. Identifying stably recurring motifs requires clustering of related results which, in turn, requires definition of 'related'. Sequence similarity based clustering is impaired by the combination of sequence variation within motifs, the short length of TF-binding sites, and aligning motifs of different lengths. Instead of using sequence based clustering, we chose to cluster results by position, counting the number of times Gibbs sampling identifies each nucleotide in the promoter (Figure 1 ). We find that Gibbs sampling predictions, generated using BioProspector (8) are power-law distributed over nucleotide position (Supplementary Figure S2) . Gibbs sampling converges on the majority of nucleotides very infrequently, and a small number of nucleotides very frequently. Thus, the most frequently recurring nucleotides appear in as few as 10% of results. Moreover, we find the power-law distribution of results is robust to Gibbs sampling algorithm and scoring scheme (data not shown). We can hypothesize that the most frequently occurring positions are the most biologically significant. Thus, discarding the least frequent Gibbs sampling results may yield higher accuracy and robust identification of biologically insignificant positions.
As a preliminary test of the above hypothesis, we applied repeated runs of Gibbs sampling to a set of 51 S.cerevisiae promoters enriched in STE12 binding as identified by wholegenome ChIP-chip experiments (10) . We used positional clustering of 1200 results to identify the most frequently recurring positions (see Methods). Incorporation of additional results did not significantly alter the distribution of results (data not shown). We chose STE12 because it is one of the best studied TFs, with a well known, highly conserved and experimentally well-defined binding motif (10, 43) . The most frequently recurring positions were compared with the known STE12binding motif (40) . We classified predictions into two categories: true positive (TP) if they resemble the experimentally identified STE12-binding motif, and false positive (FP) otherwise (see Methods). Finally, we calculated the positive predictive value PPV as PPV ¼ TP/(TP + FP).
We find that positional clustering and subsequent selection of frequently recurring nucleotides improved the PPV of the STE12 binding site by at least 37% over Gibbs sampling alone (Figure 2 ). To validate that the above results were not specific to the number of input promoters, the STE12-binding motif, or the particular Gibbs sampling implementation, we repeated the above prediction process for promoters predicted to bind to YAP1, TEC1, HAP4 and YDR026C. We also repeated the analysis replacing the original Gibbs sampling procedure with our own implementation and MotifSampler (44) . In all cases, we found positional clustering significantly improves on results over local optimization procedures alone ( Figure 3 ).
Computational discovery of TFBS can have two types of FP predictions. One type is the identification of an incorrect motif from a set of upstream regions known to bind to a TF of interest as described above (see Methods). The second type of FP error is the background discovery rate of the correct motif using upstream regions that do not bind to the TF. To simulate this rate for STE12-like binding site recovery we repeated the analysis as described above starting with 51 randomly chosen yeast promoters. We find that positional clustering identifies STE12-like sites in <5% of results, compared with 10-15% for Gibbs sampling alone. Thus, using positional clustering, the performance of computational motif discovery is enhanced not only by improving the positive predictive value in promoters of genes co-regulated by STE12, but also by decreasing the false discovery of STE12-like sites by 10%.
Next, we evaluated the effect of adding DSs on the performance of Gibbs sampling with and without positional clustering. Addition of DSs dilutes enrichment of the TF-binding site in the input set, making motif detection more challenging (17, 22) . Modeling DSs, we repeated our estimate of PPV of TFBS detection with the addition of 1-50 random yeast promoters (DSs) to the original set of 51 STE12-bound promoters. We found that positional clustering improves the PPV of Gibbs sampling by >20% through the addition of up to 80% noise or 40 DSs (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S3 ). Additionally, results of Gibbs sampling both with and without positional clustering decay linearly with the addition of decoys [R 2 ¼ 0.81 and 0.95, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4) ]. Extrapolating, we predict positional clustering will maintain an improved PPV through the addition of >100% noise or 70 DSs.
To address issues of generality, we repeated the procedure on additional sets of S.cerevisiae promoters (YAP1, TEC1, HAP4 and YDR026C). An added benefit is that we can evaluate the effect of information content of the binding motif and number of promoters on the improvement from positional clustering (22) . Repeating the analysis, we again find that independently of the set or sampling procedure, positional clustering improves accuracy through a broad range of random DSs (Figure 3 ). Improvement appears to be limited and unreliable only when sampling alone correctly identifies the binding site in fewer than 20% of results. This result is consistent with our analysis of STE12-bound promoters (Figure 2) , and may correspond to a lower limit for the efficacy of positional clustering.
Recently, researchers have noted that complementary motif detection approaches can be used together to predict binding sites more effectively than either method alone (23) . With this in mind, we evaluated positional clustering in terms of its ability to combine results from two different sampling implementations. For each dataset, an equal number of results from each approach were combined into a single dataset, and positional clustering was used to predict binding sites as described above ( Figure 3C ). We measured the average percent change in PPV for each TF on each dataset, and found positional clustering improved combined sampling by 94% compared with 25% and 27% improvement for BioProspector and MotifSampler, respectively. Additionally, clustering combined sampling improved 19 of the 22 datasets evaluated, whereas clustering of BioProspector and MotifSampler results improved 17 and 16 datasets, respectively. Thus, positional clustering is an effective mechanism to integrate results from multiple sampling procedures.
Identification of GABR cis-regulatory sequences As described above in Introduction, identifying functional TFBS in mammals is difficult due in part to inclusion of decoy sequence from long upstream regions and lack of information on co-regulation of genes. Positional clustering, as shown above, is more robust to noisy input than Gibbs sampling alone, and thus may be better suited to identify de novo cis-regulatory elements in mammalian promoters that are coordinately regulated. To test this possibility, we chose seven mammalian GABR promoters (GABRps) whose activity is potentially altered in response to status epilepticus as identified through change in mRNA levels of the gene products (10) . For each set, the initial promoters were analyzed using Gibbs sampling with positional clustering (solid triangles) and without (open triangles). Two Gibbs sampling approaches were applied to each dataset: a Gibbs sampler procedure similar to BioProspector (8) (row A), and MotifSampler (39) (row B). Row C shows the combination of both sampling procedures, along with positional clustering of the combined results. x-axis counts over addition of DSs. We evaluated the positive predictive value of each technique on each dataset, and found positional clustering generally improved the PPV through addition of 100% random DSs. (31, 35) . We also included orthologous rodent promoters in the input sets (45) . Orthologous promoters were included to provide more instances of binding sites in the input set than would be expected by random, allowing for easier detection of the sites. Inclusion of orthologous promoters has the additional effect of selectively amplifying evolutionarily conserved binding sites. Such binding sites are more likely to have major functional roles in the regulation of the GABR receptor. Thus, sensitivity to such sequences is improved at the expense of sensitivity to species-specific binding sites. With this effect in mind, we require all GABR-binding site predictions to exist in orthologous promoters. Since the mechanisms of co-regulation for the seven GABRs are unknown, hypothetical co-regulation models were evaluated by querying all 2 7 possible subsets of the seven GABRps. Clustering results on nucleotide positions and selecting the most frequently occurring positions, we predicted 13 functional TF-binding sites.
Predictions were compared with instances of known binding motifs from TRANSFAC (40) , and 8 of the 13 predictions (61.5%) resembled known binding sites for 10 TFs (Table 1) . Of the 10 TFs, 7 have been identified in the CNS of rodents: SP-1 (46); AP-2, TST-1 (POU3F1), OCT-1 (POU2F1), OLF-1 (47); CP-2 (48); and RREB-1 (49) . Furthermore, previous analyses of GABR promoter regions agree with our predictions that assign putative regulatory roles to SP-1, OCT-1, OLF-1 in the regulation of GABRs (29) . We chose to validate novel motif predictions with EMSAs and functional studies in primary cultured neurons.
EMSA (50) was performed with an excess of cold competitors to define specificity of protein binding in nuclear extracts derived from primary neocortical neurons and fibroblasts (FIBs) kept in culture. As shown in Figures 4-6 , out of six predicted binding sites found upstream of the (a, b, g and d) subunit genes, four (GABRA4, GABRB1, GABRB3 and GABRD) displayed specific binding. In addition to specific binding of neuronal extracts to novel GABRA4 motifs, we have evidence for specific binding using FIB extracts ( Figure 5A and B) , of especial interest given that the expression of GABRs is restricted to the nervous system and repressors such as the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) (51, 52) expressed in non-neuronal cells have been implicated in the neural specificity of gene expression.
Clearly, protein binding to DNA does not always necessitate regulatory function. To begin to address the functional Table 1 . Positional clustering based predictions of transcriptional regulatory sequences upstream of GABRs In total, we predict 15 orthologous pairs of regulatory sequences, representing 13 unique sequences. Comparing with known mammalian binding motifs, eight of the predictions show similarity to previously characterized TFBS, as indicated. Where no known binding motif exists, the corresponding in vitro EMSA and functional assay, if applicable, is indicated. Similar predictions are grouped together and aligned by hand. significance of our predicted regulatory motifs, we evaluated the effects of transfecting neurons with double-stranded oligonucleotides containing one of the GABRA4 novel binding motifs (dsA4O), as described above. GABRA4 is especially interesting given that it is regulated by brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after status epilepticus (31, 53) . Transfection with the dsA4O produced a significant downregulation of GABRA4 gene expression in neocortical neurons as monitored by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with no change after MOCK transfection or transfection with a dsO containing three copies of a cAMP regulatory element (CRE) (Figure 6 ).
How reliable are the binding site predictions returned by Gibbs sampling based TFBS identification algorithms? We began by evaluating the stability of binding site predictions via repeated runs of Gibbs sampling. To quantify the robustness of predictions, we counted the number of Gibbs sampling results at each nucleotide position in the input set ( Figure 1 ) over a large number of repeated trials. We find that the most frequently returned positions better predict TF binding sites than the maximally scoring motifs from Gibbs sampling (Figures 2 and 3 ). Since scoring functions are empirically derived and do not necessarily represent biological reality, the result is not altogether unexpected (17) . However, we find that selecting frequently recurring positions allows filtering of up to 90% of spurious sampling results caused by convergence on biologically uninformative local minima. Positional clustering allows unbiased aggregation of results from different motif widths, thus approximating the width of the binding site 'for free' (54) .
Next we show that positional clustering improves robustness to the addition of DSs (Figures 2 and 3) . Such sequences arise from inclusion of promoter regions in input sets without direct binding to the TF either due to experimental error or computational mis-annotation (17, 22) . In the STE12 example studied, linear regression models indicate our approach will maintain an advantage over traditional Gibbs sampling through addition of up to 150% noise to the original signal (Supplementary Figure S4) . Empirical data, however, show a sharp decrease in improvement close to the addition of 45 DSs, or roughly double the input set ( Figure 2 ). Moreover, evaluations using promoters co-regulated by other TFs Figure 6 . Double-stranded oligonucleotide functional assay for GABRA4 regulation. Primary cultures of rat neocortical neurons were treated with DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate) alone (Mock) or with DOTAP and phosphothioate oligonucleotides from either a cAMP response element (CRE Decoy) or a sequence from the GABA-A4 promoter predicted using positional clustering (GABA-A4 Decoy) (GTGCACACACACGCCCACCGCGGCTCGGG). mRNA was harvested after 24 h, and real-time RT-PCR was performed with GABA-A4 specific primers. Error bars refer to individual experiments; i.e. different platings of cells from different animals. Data was normalized to rRNA levels, and expressed as relative mRNA levels (GABA-A4/rRNA). Results are shown as mean ± SEM, N ¼ 3, asterisk indicates significantly different from control at the 95% confidence interval. Figure 5 . EMSA of three putative TF binding sites form DNA-protein complexes in neocortical and fibroblast nuclear extracts. Neocortical (NEO) and fibroblast (FIB) nuclear extracts from E18 rat embryos were incubated with three 32 P-radiolabeled probes from human A4 and D receptor subunits. Cold wild-type oligonucleotides were used to define specificity through competition. Cold oligonucleotides were added at 100-fold excess over probe. indicate positional clustering is less likely to improve predictions when Gibbs sampling identifies a correct site in <20% of repetitions ( Figure 3 ). Thus, it is possible the rather simplistic linear model overestimates improvement in robustness beyond what is practically achievable. Moreover, when multiple motifs exist in the input promoters, preliminary evidence suggests positional clustering will uniquely identify a single dominant motif (Supplementary Figure S5) . With further refinement, however, it may be possible to recover subordinate motifs, enabling identification of cis-regulatory modules. In spite of these limitations, using positional clustering of repeated runs, researchers can successfully apply sampling algorithms in identification of functional binding sites in datasets with a significant proportion of noise.
Computational prediction of TF binding in mammalian genomes poses just such a challenge due to increased decoy sequence in large upstream regions (24) . Thus, having established increased robustness to DSs in yeast, we applied our approach to identify potentially unknown GABA A receptor subunit gene regulatory sequences that may participate in the response of the genome to seizure activity. We reasoned that GABA A receptor subunit genes either up-regulated or down-regulated in the animal model of epilepsy would share common binding motifs. Using positional clustering, we predicted 13 TF-binding sites upstream of GABA A receptor subunit genes ( Table 1) . Twelve of our predictions were verified by either comparison to known binding sites or experimental verification using in vitro binding assays. Initially positive experimental results highlight the ability of computational techniques to direct research into transcriptional regulation in mammalian models. As such, our approach may be applicable in the study of other protein complexes in the mammalian proteome.
The reported predictions may enable pharmacologically important downstream research. For example the predicted sites can be used as a starting point for quantifying in vivo effect on downstream transcription; for identifying the TFs bound; and even for the more complex task of understanding the role of each site in determining the relative abundance of GABA A receptor isoforms. Research along these lines may dramatically improve our understanding of GABA A receptor regulation and its role in disease and development. Additionally, a more comprehensive evaluation of the remaining GABA A receptor subunit genes may reveal additional TFbinding sites that uncover the evolutionary significance of g-a-b GABR clusters in the human genome.

178,81b22a5b5989dfc8f57c6d05fd29d3c735785887,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause outbreaks in humans as a result of spillover events from dromedaries. In contrast to humans, MERS-CoV-exposed dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses. These strong antibody responses may be caused by affinity maturation as a result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that dromedariesapart from conventional antibodies-have relatively unique, heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs). These HCAbs are devoid of light chains and have long complementarity-determining regions with unique epitope binding properties, allowing them to recognize and bind with high affinity to epitopes not recognized by conventional
VHHs or nanobodies. In vitro, these VHHs efficiently blocked virus entry at picomolar concentrations. The selected VHHs bind with exceptionally high affinity to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein. Furthermore, camel/human chimeric HCAbs-composed of the camel VHH linked to a human Fc domain lacking the CH1 exon-had an extended half-life in the serum and protected mice against a lethal MERS-CoV challenge. HCAbs represent a promising alternative strategy to develop novel interventions not only for MERS-CoV but also for other emerging pathogens.","In 2012, a novel virus, termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in humans (1) . Six years later, more than 2000 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases, including 36% with a fatal outcome, have been reported globally. Most cases thus far originated from the Arabian Peninsula, as a result of hospital outbreaks (2) . There is convincing evidence that dromedary camels are the primary source of MERS-CoV infection in humans. The virus isolated from camels is similar to that isolated from humans and also replicates in human cells (3) . In addition, epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses suggest multiple introductions of MERS-CoV into the human population (2, 4) . This raises a great concern as MERS-CoV could continue to cause outbreaks in the near future. Effective prophylactic and therapeutic intervention strategies are therefore needed to combat this virus.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising candidates for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. Recently, MERS-CoV-neutralizing mAbs have been identified and characterized by several research groups, using various approaches. These antibodies have been isolated from human naïve B cells (5) , memory B cells of MERS-CoV-infected individuals (6) , or transgenic mice expressing human antibody variable heavy chains (VHHs) and  light chains (7) . All these mAbs target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein. The MERS-CoV spike protein is a structural viral component that contains the RBD, located in the S1 subunit of the protein, which binds to the MERS-CoV entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) (8) . Antibodies raised against the S1 or RBD block MERS-CoV infection in vitro (9, 10) , and the most potent mAbs identified against MERS-CoV thus far recognize the RBD (5, 7, (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, production of these mAbs at a large scale is costly and requires a long developmental process, and relative large quantities might be needed to protect humans against a viral infection (15) . Alternatively, antibody engineering technologies allow the cloning of variable regions of mAbs for expression in Escherichia coli or yeast to produce large amounts of recombinant antibody fragments (16) . To date, 68 therapeutic mAbs have been licensed, of which 7 are chimeric antibodies (17) .
Heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs) are naturally produced in camelid species (18) . These antibodies are dimeric and do not contain a light chain, and their antigen recognition region is solely formed by the VHH region termed single-domain antibody fragment. This fragment is about 14 kDa in size, is relatively stable, and can be produced with high yields in prokaryotic systems (18, 19) . Camelid VHHs have long complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) loops, capable of binding to unique epitopes not accessible to conventional antibodies (20) . Because of these beneficial properties, VHHs have been exploited for a range of biotechnological applications, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and fundamental research (21, 22) . The recent preclinical success of a VHH that blocks von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet aggregation (23) shows their therapeutic potential. VHHs may also efficiently prevent entry of viruses into host cells (24) . Chimeric HCAbs, which have the camel VHH and the human Fc portion (lacking the CH1 exon as in camel HCAbs), allow them to interact with human effector cells and complement cascade factors (15) .
Several studies have demonstrated the presence of high levels of MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (mean virus neutralization titer ≈ 1000) in dromedary camels in the Middle East and Africa (25) (26) (27) . Therefore, next to human mAbs, characterization of MERS-CoV-neutralizing VHHs from dromedary camels could serve as an alternative strategy to develop neutralizing antibodies. Here, we report the identification and characterization of neutralizing VHHs against MERS-CoV from immunized dromedary camels and demonstrate the prophylactic activity of camel/human chimeric HCAbs in a MERS-CoV transgenic mouse model.
First, we identified MERS-CoV-neutralizing VHHs by direct cloning and screening of VHH complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries derived from bone marrow cells (given the high frequency of specific plasma cells) rather than using B cells from peripheral blood of immunized animals (Fig. 1) . Bone marrow was obtained from two dromedary camels immunized with modified vaccinia virus encoding the MERS-CoV spike protein and subsequently challenged with live MERS-CoV (28) . At the time of sampling, MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies were detected at very high levels (titer > 10,000) in the sera of these dromedaries ( Fig. 2A) . Subsequently, VHH-specific primers (29) were used to amplify a VHH library from the bone marrow cDNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (fig. S1, A to C). Fig. 1 . Schematic overview of VHH identification by direct cloning using bone marrow from immunized dromedary camels. Immunized dromedary camels were anesthetized, and bone marrow aspirations were performed. After total RNA isolation and first-strand cDNA synthesis, VHH genes were amplified and cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector (pMES4) and transformed into E. coli WK6. Individual clones were grown overnight in 96-deep-well plates, during which they expressed the VHHs in the periplasm. Next, crude VHHs were released from the periplasm by freeze-thawing the bacterial pellet. Crude VHHs were used for immunofluorescent staining on virus-infected cells. Immunofluorescent positive clones were further characterized for their genetic makeup, specificity, and potency by sequencing, antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), virus neutralization assay, epitope mapping, and structural analysis. Finally, potent VHHs were produced as camel/human chimeric single chain-only antibodies.
After gel purification, PCR products were directly cloned into the dephospho rylated prokaryotic expression vector pMES4, tagging the VHHs with six histidine amino acids at the C terminus (29) . To obtain a high-diversity repertoire of VHHs, we reduced the number of amplification cycles. The ligated VHH plasmid library was transformed into E. coli strain WK6 and plated on ampicillin nutrient agar plates without preculturing the bacteria in nutrient medium. A total of 560 VHH clones (225 from camel 1 and 335 from camel 2) were obtained in a single transformation event, and grown individually in 96-deep-well plates. Periplasmic expression of recombinant VHHs was induced by isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fig. 1 ). VHHs were purified from the periplasm as a crude extract (30) , and expression was verified using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis ( fig. S1D ). Next, we used formalin-fixed and permeabilized virus-infected cells [either MERS-CoV-infected or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected] to select for MERS-CoV-specific VHHs using immunofluorescent staining. Crude periplasmic VHH extracts were incubated on the infected cells, and VHH cell binding was visualized with a fluorescently labeled anti-histidine antibody as a secondary antibody. All 560 VHH clones were screened by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B) . We obtained 204 MERS-CoV-reactive VHHs (41.7% from camel 1 and 58.3% from camel 2), of which none reacted to SARS-CoV-infected cells. To confirm the specificity of the VHHs for MERS-CoV, we randomly selected several clones for double staining of MERS-CoV-infected cells using a rabbit anti-MERS-CoV serum, revealing that these VHHs exclusively targeted MERS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 2C) .
To test whether the VHHs identified in our study recognized the RBD or other parts of the S1, we performed MERS-CoV S1-and MERS-CoV RBD-specific ELISAs. Out of 204 MERS-CoV-reactive VHHs, 188 (92.15%) were directed against the MERS-CoV S1 subunit, of which 46 VHHs (22.5%) blocked the binding of recombinant S1 to the MERS-CoV receptor present on Huh-7 cells ( fig. S2 ). All these in vitro blocking VHHs were directed against the RBD (Fig. 2D) . Next, we selected all blocking VHHs for further characterization. The VHH clone p2E6 (negative for immunofluorescent staining and S1 ELISA) was used as the negative control. Using a MERS-CoV plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), we estimated the virus neutralization capacity for each VHH. Except for the control VHH-p2E6, all tested VHHs inhibited MERS-CoV entry at varying concentrations ranging from 100 to 900 pM (PRNT 90 ; table S1). VHHs with high neutralizing capacity (VHH-1, VHH-4, VHH-83, and VHH-101) were selected for further characterization.
We obtained sequences from all 46 blocking VHHs. Because CDR3 is known to be of most importance for the interaction with the antigen, the assumption was made that VHHs with the identical CDR3 would recognize the same epitope. Overall, 33 VHHs had different CDR3 sequences ranging in length from 16 to 20 amino acids ( fig. S3 ). Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed considerable diversity among the different VHH clones and showed that the selected VHHs formed 14 different clusters with different CDR3 sequences ( fig. S4 ). All sequences contained the characteristic VHH tetrad, except clone 10 that, at amino acid positions 37, 45, and 47, shows VH characteristics (valine, leucine, and tryptophan). The best MERS-CoV-neutralizing VHHs (VHH-1, VHH-4, VHH-83, and VHH-101) had different CDR3 sequences ( fig. S4 ).
Subsequently, the best four neutralizing VHHs and the control VHH-p2E6 were selected for large-scale production and purification. We obtained high quantities (5 to 30 mg) of pure (>95%) His-tag affinitypurified VHHs from 1 liter of bacterial culture ( fig. S5A ). Mixing these VHHs with recombinant MERS-CoV spike S1 protein generated VHHspike complexes, as observed by nonreducing PAGE analysis ( fig. S5B ). In addition, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d ) between the VHH and spike protein of these four VHHs was relatively low, with 
Next, we tested the neutralizing activities of these VHHs in vitro by PRNT. All four VHHs were confirmed to neutralize MERS-CoV with high efficiency, with PRNT 50 values ranging from 0.0014 to 0.012 g/ml (93 to 800 pM), while no inhibition was observed using the control VHH-p2E6 at high concentration (>1.0 g/ml; 67 M; Fig. 3A ). Because of their small size, VHHs are rapidly cleared from the circulation (30, 31) . Therefore, we additionally produced the four VHHs as camel/human chimeric HCAbs by C-terminal tagging the VHHs with the Fc part of human immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) (containing the hinge and CH2 and CH3 exons) (Fig. 1, right) . These HCAbs (HCAb-1, HCAb-4, HCAb-83, and HCAb-101) form homodimers of about 78 kDa in size and exhibit approximately the same neutralizing capacity as the monomeric VHHs in vitro (Fig. 3B) . Moreover, using an S1-specific ELISA, we could detect HCAb binding at even lower concentrations, down to 0.00019 g/ml (2.5 pM; Fig. 3C ).
To map the VHH binding epitopes, we first tested the binding of the four different VHHs to recombinant S1 protein using ForteBio's Octet system. As shown in fig. S7 , all four VHHs competed for a single epitope. Subsequently, we used a set of recombinant S1 proteins that contain single amino acid mutations present in spike proteins of MERS-CoV field isolates, located within the receptor binding subdomain (residues 483 to 566) of the RBD that engages DPP4. MERS-CoV polyclonal antibodies, an irrelevant VHH, and four VHHs were then tested for their ability to bind to these S1 variants. MERS-CoV polyclonal antibodies, but not the control VHH-p2E6, bound to all variants (Fig. 4, A and B) , whereas the four MERS-CoV-specific VHHs did not bind to the D539N variant and differed in their binding to the other variants. VHH-1 also did not bind to variant E536K, whereas VHH-4 and VHH-101 showed partial binding to three additional variants (I529T, V534A, and E536K) (Fig. 4 , C to F). These data show that all four VHHs bind an epitope in the receptor binding subdomain that is partially overlapping, consistent with the binding competition analysis ( fig. S7 ). The RBD residues D537, D539, Y540, and R542 are important for the virus to bind to its cellular receptor DPP4 (32, 33) . Because all four VHHs did not bind to the D539N variant, this suggests that these VHHs neutralize MERS-CoV most likely by blocking its binding to its cellular receptor. Despite several attempts, we were not able to identify MERS-CoV escape variants in vitro. Because of the best neutralizing capacity and epitope recognition, we selected VHH-83 and HCAb-83 for further in vivo testing.
To test the prophylactic efficacy of VHH-83 or HCAb-83 in vivo, we used the K18 transgenic mouse model (34) . In our first experiment, mice were given VHH-83 or an irrelevant VHH control (p2E6) at 20 or 200 g per mouse (nine mice per group) by intraperitoneal injection 6 hours before intranasal infection with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV (EMC isolate). Mice that received VHH-83 lost weight and died within 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), as well as those injected with the control VHH ( fig. S8 ). Next, we tested HCAb-83 or the control HCAb-p2E6 using a similar experimental setup. Mice treated with 200 g of HCAb-83 gained weight (Fig. 5A) , and all mice survived (Fig. 5B) . In contrast, control HCAb-p2E6-treated groups lost weight and died within 7 dpi (Fig. 5,  A and B) . Gross pathological changes (Fig. 5C) , mononuclear cell infiltration, and alveolar edema (Fig. 5E) were observed in the lungs of control HCAb-p2E6-treated mice on day 4 after inoculation. Whereas low doses (20 g) of HCAb-83-treated mice were only partially protected on the basis of the observed reduction of pathological abnormalities on 4 dpi (Fig. 5F ), the lungs of high-dose HCAb-83-treated mice showed no pathological changes at any time point tested (Fig. 5G ). In addition, no infectious virus could be isolated from the lungs of these mice, while high viral titers were observed in the low dose-and control HCAb-treated mice (Fig. 5H) .
We also evaluated the pharmacokinetics of VHH and HCAb in the sera of mice treated with either VHH-83 or HCAb-83. First, we estimated the presence of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in sera obtained 2 days after treatment. No neutralization of the virus was observed in the sera of VHH-83-or control VHH-p2E6-treated mice (Fig. 6A) , consistent with the reported rapid clearance of small VHH domains from the circulation (31). Significant levels of neutralizing antibodies (mean titer, 1024) were observed in the sera of mice treated with 200 g of HCAb-83 and, to a limited extent, in low dose-treated mice (mean titer, 64; Fig. 6A ). Second, we tested the presence of circulating HCAb-83 in the sera obtained at various time points after injection (0, 2, 4, and 8 days after treatment) by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6B, 200 
VHHs are small in size; have high stability, solubility, and affinity; and efficiently recognize antigens. They have many potential biomedical applications including the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and virus infections (18, 19, 22, 24, 31) . Moreover, VHHs are gaining much attention in the field of diagnostics and therapeutics for viral diseases. They have been used for the detection of viruses, such as Marburg virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, dengue virus, and norovirus (22, 24) . VHHs also block virus attachment to the host cells in respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, rotavirus, and HIV infections (22, 24) . Some VHHs inhibit viral RNA transcription or nuclear import of viral ribonucleoproteins (35) . Here, we have shown that MERS-CoV-neutralizing VHHs can be obtained from immunized dromedary camels that were Naturally infected dromedary camels have remarkably high levels of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV (25, 36) . We used dromedaries that showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies in their sera and identified MERS-CoV-neutralizing VHHs by direct cloning from a VHH cDNA library using bone marrow, a major source of highly enriched long-lived antibody-producing plasma cells. After immunization, antigen-stimulated B cells undergo affinity maturation in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs, where they differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies. Significant portion of longlived plasma cells migrate to the bone marrow. A small portion of plasma cells reside in the lymphoid organs, but these are often short-lived (37, 38) . In mice, 8 days after boost immunization with ovalbumin, about 10 to 20% of the antigen-specific plasma cells migrate from secondary lymphoid organs to the bone marrow (39) . In particular, bone marrow plasma cells are long-lived and are thus suitable for maintaining antibody levels in the serum for an extended period, which plays a significant role in pathogen neutralization and humoral immune responses (40) . The number of S1-specific clones found in the VHH library generated from vaccinated and infected camels (188 of 560 clones; 33.5%) was much higher compared to nonvaccinated infected camels (12 of 496 clones; 2.4%), suggesting that the vaccination and challenge protocol used in this study had a major impact on the frequency of S1-specific B cells detected in the bone marrow.
Camelid species have naturally occurring HCAbs. These antibodies contain long CDR3 sequences (20) , which allow them to interact with unique and even recessed epitopes that may not be recognized by conventional antibodies (20, 41) . We identified 46 MERS-CoV-neutralizing VHHs, of which 4 bound to the RBD of the spike protein with high affinity and neutralized MERS-CoV infection at picomolar concentrations. VHH-83 showed a neutralizing capacity down to a concentration of 30 pM (PRNT 50 ), making it more potent than the most potent mAbs described thus far (7, 42) . However, direct comparisons between different antibodies would require determining the exact differences in vitro. Competition and spike protein binding assays showed that the four VHHs competed for binding to an overlapping epitope on the RBD, which partially overlaps with the RBD-DPP4 interface. Binding assays using variant recombinant spike proteins revealed that all four VHHs bound to wild-type spike protein but not to a D539N-mutant protein. Amino acids E536, D537, and D539 are negatively charged residues on the surface of the RBD, which interact with three positively charged residues on the outer surface of the DPP4 (32, 33) . This indicates that the four VHHs can prevent virus attachment and entry. Given the critical role of these amino acids in the DPP4-virus interaction, viral escape mutants without loss of fitness are less likely to develop (32, 33) . This could be the reason why we did not identify HCAb-83 escape variants in vitro. However, further (structural) studies are needed to pinpoint all RBD-VHH contact residues involved.
Next, we produced the four VHHs as HCAbs, which showed threefold enhanced MERS-CoV-neutralizing capacity in comparison to the monomeric VHHs in vitro (PRNT 50 , 30 pM). In contrast to VHH-83, mice prophylactically treated with 200 g of HCAb-83 were fully protected from weight loss and death upon challenge with live virus. No infectious virus was detected in the lungs of these mice, and protection correlated with the presence of sustained high levels of HCAbs-83 in the sera of mice. In addition, most in vivo studies testing mAbs to MERS-CoV showed only reduced MERS-CoV replication (two to four log reductions in lung virus titer) or complete protection only at higher doses used (1000 g per mouse) (6, 7, 13) . The high level of neutralizing activity of HCAb-83 (PRNT 50 , 30 pM) could be due to the different antigen recognition pattern of camelid HCAbs. Recent studies also revealed the importance of long CDR3 sequences from bovine antibodies raised against HIV in cross-neutralization against different viral serotypes (43) . The therapeutic efficacy of HCAb-83 still needs further evaluation, but given the limited therapeutic efficacy of other mAbs against acute respiratory infections such as respiratory syncytial virus in humans (44) , prophylactic administration of antibodies may also be preferred to contain outbreaks of MERS-CoV.
Apart from direct neutralization, antibodies may also play a role in mediating effector functions such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (16) . HCAb-83 has an Fc domain of human IgG2, which has limited effector function in vivo (17) , suggesting that the observed protection in mice could be mainly due to the neutralizing activity. Therefore, additional studies need to evaluate whether the potency of HCAb-83 may be increased further by replacing the IgG2 Fc with the IgG1 Fc or by combination with other antibodies targeting different epitopes.
In summary, we identified and characterized potent HCAbs that neutralized MERS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. Because of their high affinity, in vivo stability, and efficacy, these HCAbs may be used as a prophylaxis for MERS-CoV.
One female (6-month-old) and one male (8-month-old) healthy dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), negative for antibodies against MERS-CoV and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), were obtained from the Canary Islands and housed in biosecurity level 3 (BSL-3) facilities [Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA)], as described previously (28) . Experimental procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (number 8003). Both animals were immunized twice with a 4-week interval with 10 8 plaque-forming units of MVA-S via both nostrils and intramuscularly in the neck of the animals. After the second immunization, both animals were anesthetized with midazolam (5 mg/ml) and inoculated with 10 7 TCID 50 MERS-CoV in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intranasally in both nostrils using a laryngo-tracheal mucosal atomization device (45) . Blood samples were taken at different dpi. On day 14 after inoculation, both animals were anesthetized and femoral bone marrow samples (about 1 cm 3 ) were collected next to the epiphysis and placed, each, in tubes containing 3.6 ml of ice-cold fetal calf serum. Specimens were gently crushed with a 1-ml tip and homoge nized by slow up and down pipetting. After 10-min incubation on ice, 400 l of dimethyl sulfoxide was mixed into each tube, and the preparation was dispensed into 2-ml cryovials discarding debris and slurs and stored at −135°C.
The recombinant S1-Fc fusion proteins were produced as described previously (46) . Briefly, plasmids encoding MERS-CoV S1-Fc or MERS-CoV RBD-Fc were generated by ligating a fragment encoding the S1 subunit (GenBank accession number AFS88936; residues 1 to 747) or RBD (residues 358 to 588) 3′ terminally to a fragment encoding the Fc domain of human IgG1 into the pCAGGS expression vector. Plasmids encoding S1-Fc variants with single amino acid substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. S1-Fc fusion proteins were expressed by transfection of the expression plasmids into human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T (CRL-11268, American Type Culture Collection) cells and affinity-purified from the culture supernatant using Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare).
MERS-CoV-specific antibody titers were measured by ELISA. First, 96-well plates were coated with MERS-CoV S1 or MERS-CoV RBD proteins at 1 g/ml in PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Wells were then washed three times with PBS, blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Dromedary camel sera or VHHs were serially diluted in PBS, 100 l was added per well, and plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Next, plates were washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), after which they were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-llama antibodies (1:2000, Abcore) or mouse anti-histidine anti-bodies (1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C for 1 hour. After three washes with PBST, plates were incubated with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:10,000, Dako) or goat anti-mouse HRP (1:2000, Dako) at 37°C for 1 hour. After this incubation, plates were washed three times in PBST and incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the presence of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (eBioscience). Reactions were stopped with 2N H 2 SO 4 (Sigma). The absorbance of each sample was read at 450 nm with an ELISA reader (Tecan Infinite F200).
For RNA isolation, cryopreserved bone marrow cells were removed from the −135°C freezer and transferred to a 37°C water bath. The thawed cell suspension was quickly transferred to 40 ml of ice-cold RPMI 1640 (Lonza) medium. Cells were counted, and 10 7 cells were transferred to a new ribonuclease (RNase)-free falcon tube and centrifuged at room temperature at 300g for 10 min. The supernatant was completely removed, and cells were subsequently lysed with 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and 0.2 ml of RNase-free chloroform (Life Technologies). The mixture was vortexed for 15 s and incubated for 3 min at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube. Subsequently, RNA was isolated using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was quantified at 260 nm using the NanoDrop 2000, and the quality of the isolated RNA sample was determined by measuring the A 260 /A 280 ratio. cDNA was synthesized from 1.5 g of total RNA using a First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Life Technologies). For a 20-l reaction mix, 10 l of RNA, 1 l of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs; 10 mM each), 1 l of random hexamers (10 mM; Promega), and 1.5 l of distilled water (dH 2 O) were added to a microvial. The mixture was incubated at 65°C for 10 min and then at 4°C for 2 min. Next, 6.5 l of reverse transcriptase mix containing 4 l of 5× SuperScript III reaction buffer, 1 l of dithiothreitol (100 mM), 0.5 l of RNase inhibitor (20 U/l), and 1 l of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (200 U/l; Life Technologies) were added to the microvial and incubated at 25°C for 5 min, 50°C for 45 min, and 70°C for 20 min. cDNA was stored at 4°C until PCR amplification.
The amplification of VHH was performed using a nested PCR approach (29) that was adapted for use with a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase, Stratagene). The first PCR mix (50 l of reaction volume) consisted of 5.0 l of 10× PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase buffer, 2.5 l of dNTPs (10 mM each), 1.5 l of gene-specific forward primer (CALL001, 5′-GTCCTGGCTGCTCTTCTACAAGG-3′; 10 mM), 1.5 l of genespecific reverse primer (CALL002, 5′-GGTACGTGCTGTTGAACT-GTTCC-3′; 10 mM), 1.0 l of PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase, 36.5 l of dH 2 O, and 2.0 l of cDNA. PCR amplification was performed in a thermocycler with the following protocol: initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 20 cycles at 94°C for 20 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The first PCR generated two amplified products: the heavy chain of conventional antibodies (~1000 bp) and the VHH heavy chain (~700 bp; fig. S1 ). The amplified VHH amplicon (~700 bp) was purified from the agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The product was then subjected to the second round of PCR amplification using VHH inner primers that contained restriction sites for cloning: forward, 5′-CTAGTGCGGCCGCTGGAGACGGTGACCTGGGT-3′ (Eco 91I); reverse, 5′-GATGTGCAGCTGCAGGAGTCTGGRG-GAGG-3′ (Pst I). PCR amplification continued for 12 to 14 cycles, after which the amplicons were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and digested using Eco 91I and Pst I. The vector pMES4 (GenBank accession number GQ907248) was digested with the same enzymes and dephosphorylated using alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). VHH amplicons were ligated into pMES4 using a ratio of 100 ng of vector to 46 ng of VHH (~1:3 molar ratio). Next, we used E. coli strain WK6, prepared using the Mix & Go! E. coli Transformation Kit and Buffer Set (Zymo Research), for transformation according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transformation, cells were directly plated onto an ampicillin (100 g/ml) nutrient agar plates. The following day, the insertion of VHH into the vector was confirmed by randomly picking 25 clones, screening by PCR for the insert, and Sanger sequencing, as described below.
To sequence the inserts, colony PCR was performed using PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Agilent Technologies) and primers (29) 5′-TTATGCTTCCGGCTCGTATG-3′ (MP57) and 5′-CCA-CAGACAGCCCTCATAG-3′ (GIII) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 39 cycles of (95°C for 20 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 40 s), and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The amplicons were gel-purified and sequenced in both directions using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The obtained sequences were assembled and aligned using CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC Bio 4.9).

179,62219dc0553022e4faac2b1523e7e0a2d1eaec30,"Since the progression of cirrhosis is accelerated each time a complication recurs, the management and treatment of the complication is critical in enhancement of the quality of life and expectation of life in patients. The use of model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium (MELD-Na) with physiological indicators can be used to assess severity and differentiate therapeutic interventions.
This study is aimed to determine the mean survival period and cumulative survival rate by classifying patients into high-risk and lowrisk groups based on MELD-Na, a predictor of mortality in liver disease, and to investigate the mortality prognostic factors.
A retrospective cohort study, which follows the STROBE checklist, was performed. 263 patients who were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis complications for the first time and hospitalized were selected as the subjects of this study. The collected data were analyzed based on the survival package provided by the statistical program R version 3.4.2.
Subjects were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups using MELD-Na 14 points where sensitivity and specificity crossed the cut-off point. Gender, age, and primary caregiver were significant variables in the mortality high-risk group, and AST, albumin, and primary caregiver were significant variables in the mortality low-risk group. Based on these mortality prognostic factors, it is possible to present the factors affecting mortality in patients who were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis complications for the first time. The classification of patients by risk level could be the foundation to provide accurate guidelines for management and it is necessary to modify prognostic factors and apply nursing interventions to manage complications.

[1] Liver cirrhosis ranks as the 14th leading cause of mortality in adults in the world and in Korea, liver diseases rank as the 8th leading cause of mortality, accounting for 13.3 deaths per 100,000. [2, 3] The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates of patients with cirrhosis are 68%, 57%, and 43%, respectively. Liver cirrhosis is one of the major diseases leading to mortality in Korea in which the incidence rate of hepatitis B is high. [4] There are a variety of causes, including chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, consumption of a large amount of alcohol, and autoimmunity, while hepatitis B is the most common, with 48% to 70% of cases. [5] Depending on the presence of complications in the progress of liver cirrhosis, it is classified into decompensated cirrhosis, with complications, and compensated cirrhosis, without complications. [6] The progress rate of compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis is approximately 58% and once it progresses to decompensated cirrhosis, its mortality rate within 5 years becomes 85% without liver transplantation. [7] Complications could cause a high difference in the progress of the disease. Most common complications are ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and varicose veins. [8] Since the progression of cirrhosis is accelerated each time a complication recurs, the management and treatment of the complication is critical in enhancing the quality of life and the life expectancy of patients. [7] With the recent diversification of chronic diseases, the incidence rate of complications has also risen; so, the management of complications has a higher influence over the quality of life. [7] [8] [9] Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that in patients with liver cirrhosis, the presence of complications and its treatment are critical factors for anticipating the degradation of the quality of life and the mortality.
Liver transplantation enhances the quality of life and survival rate of patients with cirrhosis; however, numerous patients are not given the opportunity of liver transplantation due to a lack of donors. As an indicator for the progress and prognosis of cirrhosis, the model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium (MELD-Na) has been recommended. [10, 11] Traditionally, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) is used as index for assessing the progress of cirrhosis of an inpatient, and the severity of cirrhosis is classified into A, B, and C based on the presence of ascites and/or hepatic encephalopathy, serum bilirubin, prothrombin period, and serum albumin. [10, 12] Using CTP, 5 to 6 points are assigned to Stage A, 7 to 9 points to Stage B, and 10 points or higher to Stage C. The higher the score is, the more severe it gets. [10] However, since subjective judgement could be involved in the judgement of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, indices of CTP, the judgement of severity using the MELD or the MELD-Na is becoming more important, as well as treatment mediation based on such severity. [11] MELD-Na is assessed with serum bilirubin, prothrombin period, serum creatinine, serum sodium, and other factors. Since MELD-Na is more likely to predict mortality than other tools, it has been recently used to create a waiting list of patients for liver transplantation. [12, 13] Studies on the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis have been mostly focused on terminal cases and anticipation of short-term mortality, and most of them highlight the analysis of prognosis of patients with cirrhosis rather than classification of patients considering the level of severity. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Moreover, the analysis of prognostic factors for mortality of patients should include not only disease-related factors, but also personal and social factors. Such analysis could provide a comprehensive and systematic understanding of patients diagnosed with cirrhotic complications. Therefore, in this study, patients diagnosed with cirrhotic complications were divided into a high-risk group and a low-risk group using MELD-Na designed with objective physiological indicators, and prognostic factors were analyzed for each group. We aimed to devise a self-nursing method suitable for each severity level of liver cirrhosis and to provide basic data for improving the effectiveness of management of chronic diseases.
The purpose of this study was to check the average period of survival and average accumulated rate of survival for patients diagnosed with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or varicose veins, which are complications of cirrhosis. Patients were hospitalized because of the complications for the first time and they were assigned to either a group at high risk for mortality or a group at low risk for mortality after examination using MELD-Na, and for each group, mortality prognostic factors were investigated. To achieve this, the following was done: 1) information regarding the patient's personal, disease, social and environmental factors, and mortality was identified; 2) the cut-off point for MELD-Na for classifying the patient to either the high-risk group or the low-risk group was identified; 3) information regarding the personal, disease, social and environmental factors, and mortality in the high-risk group or the low-risk group was identified; 4) differences in the average period of survival and average accumulated rate of survival between the high risk group and the low risk group were examined; and 5) mortality prognostic factors of all patients, the high-risk group, and the low-risk group were identified.
A retrospective cohort study was carried out. Our study was applied to the STROBE Checklist of items. This study was approved (2016-08-072) by an appropriate Institutional Review Board and the investigation conformed with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The participants of this study were patients who were diagnosed with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or varicose veins and admitted to a general hospital located in Seoul for the first time due to that reason. Among 10,535 patients admitted to the hospital due to complications of cirrhosis, 263 patients were selected based on the criteria stated above and exclusion criteria. The aforementioned selection criteria and exclusion criteria for the participants were as follows.
(a) patients, aged 18 or older, diagnosed with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or varicose veins and admitted to a hospital for the first time due to that reason; (b) patients diagnosed with at least one of the complications, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or varicose veins. 2) Exclusion criteria:
(a) patients simultaneously diagnosed with at least two complications, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or varicose veins; (b) patients with history of complications of liver cirrhosis; (c) patients diagnosed with chronic renal failure, malignant tumor, and/or cardiovascular disease at the time of hospitalization; (d) patients who underwent liver transplantation during the data collection period.
The data collection of this study was executed after being approved by the institutional review board of the general hospital. For 263 patients, who were diagnosed with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or varicose veins and admitted to a general hospital for the first time due to that reason from January 1, 2002 till December 31, 2012, their electronic medical records from January 1, 2002 till July 31, 2016 were reviewed considering the fact that the median survival period of cirrhosis is 33 months. [1] The data from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017 were collected by directly filling out the items of a case record, a part of the electronic medical records. For variables of the case record, the conditions of the participants on the first day of hospitalization were observed. If the mortality of the participant was confirmed in the medical records, the period till the date of mortality was considered as the survival period. If the participant survived till the end of the study, became hospitalized during the study, stopped hospital visits, or if the mortality of the participant could not be checked, the data of such participants were considered censored. [20] Kim et al. [21] The MELD-Na score is the score calculated using the equation of MELD + 1.59 Â (135-Na) (maximum and minimum of Na are 135 and 120 mEq/L, respectively). [22] 
The collected data were analysed based on the survival package provided by the statistical program R Version 3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The detailed methods of analysis were as follows:
1) The distributions of values for the general, socioenvironmental, and clinical factors were analysed using descriptive statistics, such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. 2) For calculating the cut-off point of MELD-Na score, classifying the high-risk group and the low risk group, the receiver's operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. 3) The general, socioenvironmental, and clinical factors and mortality of the high-risk group and the low-risk group were analyzed using descriptive statistics, such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. 4) The difference between the risk groups in the average survival period was analysed using t test and the accumulated survival rate was analyzed by long-rank test while the accumulated survival rate was calculated with Kaplan-Meier estimates. 5) The analysis of mortality prognostic factors for all participants and each risk group was performed with Cox's proportional hazard regression model, and the selection of variables for a multivariate analysis was performed with the stepwise selection using Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Schoenfeld residual test was performed.
The general, socioenvironmental, and clinical factors of 263 patients were as follows ( 
For classifying the participants into a group at high risk of mortality or low risk of mortality, MELD-Na was used. The diagnostic performance of MELD-Na was evaluated with AUC criteria developed by Muller et al. [23] AUC for MELD-Na of this study was 0.70, and its diagnostic performance was found to be fair. Using the trade-off point where sensitivity and singularity of MELD-Na were crossed over, a group at high risk of mortality and a group at low risk of mortality were classified at the score of 14, a median between 13.5 and 14.5 (Fig. 1 ).
To identify the survival period distribution curve through the analysis of survival for all participants and each risk group, Kaplan-Merier estimates were used ( Table 2 ). The survival period distribution curves for all participants and each risk group are shown in Figure 2 . As shown in the figure, it could be checked that the accumulated survival rate decreased with time. In all participants and the high-risk group, the survival rate was dramatically decreased after 4, 11, and 13 years of follow-up while the accumulated survival rate of the low-risk group was shown to decrease rather gradually. There was a significant difference in the accumulated survival rate over time between the high-risk group and the low-risk group (P < .001) ( Table 3) .
Among all variables, the variables suitable for Cox's multivariate proportional hazard regression model were selected. The stepwise selection was chosen for selection of the variables. Through the selection of variables for the mortality prognostic factors of all participants, it was found that gender, cause of liver cirrhosis, CTP stage, marital status, primary caregiver, and follow-up management were significant. In addition, for the highrisk group, the gender, age, and primary caregiver were found to be significant while AST, albumin, and primary caregiver were significant variables for the low-risk group. The details are given in Table 4 . For numerical variables, they were converted to log and then, their risk rates were calculated and they were defined as exp (1)≒2.718.
In the multivariate analysis of the mortality prognostic factors of all participants, it was found that the mortality risk rate for women was 0.39 times lower than that for men (P < .001). The mortality risk rate for the participants having hepatitis C as the cause of cirrhosis was 5.32 times higher than hepatitis B (P < .001). In case of CTP stages, the mortality risk rate of CTP Stage B was 4.01 times higher than CTP Stage A (P < .001), and of CTP Stage C was 7.56 times higher than CTP Stage A (P < .001). For the participants whose primary care giver was a spouse, their mortality risk rate was 3.95 times lower than of the participants having children, siblings, or caregiver as primary caregiver, or no primary caregiver (P < .001), and the mortality risk rate for the participants having periodic follow-up management was 0.46 times lower than having irregular follow-up management (P < .001).
In the multivariate analysis of the mortality prognostic factors of the high-risk group, it was found that the mortality risk rate for women was 0.41 times lower than that for men (P < .001). In the case of age, a numerical variable, the mortality risk rate was increased 19.01 times since age was increased by 2.718 years (P < .001), and the mortality risk rate of the participants whose primary caregiver was a spouse was 2.17 times lower than of the participants having others as primary caregiver (P < .001). In the multivariate analysis of the mortality prognostic factors of the low-risk group, it was found that the mortality risk rate was increased 2.01 times higher with an increase of AST by 2.718 U/L (P < .001) and the mortality risk rate was decreased 0.04 times with an increase of albumin by 2.718 g/dL (P < .001). The mortality risk rate of the participants whose primary caregiver was a spouse was 2.38 times lower than of the participants having others as primary caregiver (P < .001).
MELD-Na is an objective index for predicting the mortality caused by liver diseases and it has been widely used for studies on the prognosis of liver disease. [11] AUC of MELD-Na of this study was found to be 0.70, which was relatively lower than that of other studies, of 0.85 to 0.92. [13, 16, 17] However, according the suggestion of Muller et al, [23] its diagnostic performance ranged from good-excellent. It would be attributable to its significantly longer follow-up period, of 14 years, than other studies of which follow-up periods were up to 20 months, and the relatively lower AUC of this study might be because it included data from even cases censored during the follow-up period in order to reduce bias in its results. [12] The cut-off point of MELD-Na for this study was 14, relatively lower than that of other studies. [13, 24] While most of the previous studies focused on patients in end-stage cirrhosis or admitted to the intensive care unit and scheduled for liver transplantation, this study focused on patients diagnosed with cirrhosis complications that could be treated in general wards, for the first time, so there would be a difference in terms of severity. Compared with previous studies, this study addressed patients with relatively low mortality rates, less severe conditions, and longer average survival period, but it would be necessary to expand the scope of participants to raise the use of the cut-off point of MELD-Na.
Since the survival rate and accumulated survival rate of this study were found to be higher than those of other studies, it supports the importance of management of complications. [19, 25] In the future, it would be necessary to study the survival rates of patients with cirrhosis, followed up for a long period, and make a comparison with this study, and the long-term survival rate of patients with cirrhosis.
It was confirmed that gender, cause of liver cirrhosis, CTP stage, marital status, primary caregiver, and follow-up management were prognosis factors affecting the mortality of the participants, and in a number of studies, gender has been addressed as an important factor. [1, 26, 27] The cause of cirrhosis was also found to be an important predicator of mortality. Although a difference between hepatitis B and hepatitis C could be attributable, [28] it also supported that a rapid treatment of viral hepatitis might affect prognosis. That is why, the early administration of antiviral drugs is important for reducing the incidence of cirrhosis and disease-related mortality. [29] Due to the recent diversification of hepatitis antiviral drugs, it would be the Table 2 Cumulative survival rate of patients with liver cirrhosis complications (N = 263).
High risk (MELD-Na ≥ 14) (N = 120) Low risk (MELD-Na < 14) (N = 143) would be necessary to devise a specific plan to raise the rate of administration of antiviral drugs. CTP point and stage are very important factors for predicting mortality, and other studies have supported. [12, 27] Among various significant prognostic factors of patients with cirrhosis, CTP score was claimed to be the most significant variable. [1] Therefore, despite the criticism that the CTP point is a subjective tool, it is still a very important index to determine the prognosis of cirrhosis. [10] The modified Chile-Pugh classification was used to reduce the criticism of the CTP score by taking into account the changes in patient consciousness such as depression, disorientation or confusion, however, the hematological values of the Table 4 The Multivariate analysis of mortality prognostic factors of patients with liver cirrhosis complications (N = 263). physiological indicators reflected are not significantly different from CTP because they remain unchanged. [30, 31] In addition to CTP or modified Chile-Pugh classification, indocyanine green (ICG) test, MELD, MELD-Na, and MELD to Serum Sodium ratio (MESO) have been examined as mortality predictors, but their accuracies vary between patients, depending on the presence of complications and/or variables. [10] [11] [12] The necessity of a comparative study of mortality prediction tools has been constantly emphasized, and it would be also important to discuss the patient-reported outcomes (PRO) that could affect the quality of life for patients. [32] In addition, it would be also helpful to use various tools simultaneously to have an accurate prediction.
Marital status and primary caregivers are important predictors, especially from the aspect of nursing. Since there is no study on the relationship between mortality prognosis and primary caregivers for patients with cirrhosis, it is not possible to have a direct comparison, but in the study on self-management of disease by the recipient of liver transplantation, family relationship was found to be a factor affecting self-management of disease, and family supports and cohabitation were shown to be important variables for self-management of disease for patients with chronic diseases. [33, 34] Therefore, family support could affect the self-management of disease as well as progression and prognosis of disease. Since a patient's spouse constantly seeks out what the patient needs, communicates, and exchanges emotions with the patient, the presence of a spouse could affect disease selfmanagement of a patient. [33] The results of this study also support the importance of a spouse's support and suggest the importance of participation of a spouse in the treatment of a patient.
Only in the low-risk group, there were significant differences in AST and albumin, and other studies also support that bilirubin, albumin, PT, and others are mortality predictors for patients with cirrhosis. [1, 35] However, as shown in the systematic review by D'Amico et al, [1] since there are only few studies addressing AST, it would be necessary to consider more various laboratory results. Laboratory results are not significant as a mortality predictor in the high-risk group because they are included in the classification criterion or they include abnormal results since patients are at high risk for mortality. On the other hand, in case of the low-risk group, laboratory results are likely to indicate normal conditions so the change in such laboratory results could have a significant influence over the mortality risk rate. Therefore, for patients with early stage cirrhosis, laboratory results are very important and it is also important for them to understand that it is critical to monitor and correct the laboratory results for the treatment of disease.
In the high-risk group, age was shown to be an important variable and it was supported by our results that the average age was 54.67 years and that age becomes a very important mortality predictor if the patient is over 50 years old. [27] The fact that important risk factors differ among risk groups has a clinically important meaning. The classification of patients by risk level could be the foundation to provide accurate guidelines for disease management. Furthermore, this classification could be the foundation for patients with cirrhosis, for which early detection of mortality prognosis and timely management of complications are critical to correct such prognostic factors and apply a proper nursing intervention. This study is significant given that it applied MELD-Na to patients diagnosed with cirrhosis complications for the first time, examined its cut-off point to classify patients based on the risk of disease, and investigated the risk factors for each risk group. Furthermore, it examined prognostic factors from a population-social perspective, other than the medical perspective.
Since this study collected data from a single center, it would not be appropriate to generalize its results; hence, it would be necessary to conduct multi-center replication study. In addition, a study on the analysis of survival and mortality prognostic factors for patients with disease, other than complications of cirrhosis, from the perspective of nursing would be very beneficial.
For patients diagnosed with complications of cirrhosis for the first time, it was found that gender, cause of liver cirrhosis, CTP stage, marital status, primary caregiver, and follow-up management were variables affecting mortality prognosis, as well as gender, age, and primary caregiver for the high-risk group and AST, albumin, and primary caregiver for the low-risk group. Since this study analyzed mortality prognostic factors through the analysis of survival of patients with cirrhosis, it would be possible to have a variety of studies on factors of survival and mortality of patients from the perspective of nursing through the analysis of survival of various diseases. Especially, based on the results of this study, when nursing patients are diagnosed with complications of cirrhosis for the first time, early detection of mortality prognostic factors would be possible. Such early detection could allow for the correction of factors that might promote mortality, as well as prevention of recurrence of the complications and provision of nursing interventions to help the progress of disease in patients.",Analysis of mortality prognostic factors using model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium classification for liver cirrhosis complications: A retrospective cohort study,"Kim, Yuna; Kim, Kyunghee; Jang, Insil",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6855481/,274,3661,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
182,104e60eede9e4016c243f20f4541a33852ea3d1c,"Purpose: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection can cause various neurological complications. This study aimed to investigate the RSV-associated neurologic manifestations that present with seizures. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged less than 15 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV infections and seizures between January 2011 and December 2016 in a regional hospital in South Korea. Results: During this period, 1,193 patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were identified. Of these, 35 (35 of 1,193, 2.93%; boys, 19; girls, 16; mean age: 20.8 ± 16.6 months) presented with sei zure. Febrile seizure was the most common diagnosis (27 of 35, 77.1%); simple febrile seizures in 13 patients (13 of 27, 48.1%) and complex febrile seizures in 14 (14 of 27, 51.9%). Afebrile seizures without meningitis or encephalo pathy were observed in 5 patients (5 of 35, 14.3%), seizures with meningitis in 2 (2 of 35, 5.7%), and seizure with encephalopathy in 1 (1 of 35, 2.9%) patient. Lower respiratory symptoms were not observed in 8 patients. In a patient with encephalopathy, brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed transient changes in white matter, suggesting cytotoxic edema as the mechanism underlying encephalopathy. Most patients recovered with general management, and progression to epilepsy was noted in only 1 patient. Conclusion: Although febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure associated with RSV infection, the propor tion of patients with complex febrile seizures was higher than that of those with general febrile seizures. Transient cytotoxic edema may be a pathogenic mechanism in RSV-related encephalopathy with seizures.","The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute respiratory tract infection in young children. The common respiratory manifestations are bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, and croup. By the age of 2 years, approximately 90% children are infected by RSV, and approximately 45% of the RSV-related hospital admissions occur in children younger than 6 months. 1, 2) As in other common viral infections, RSV may be associated with neurological manifestations, including seizures, encephalopathy, extraocular movement disorder, and central apnea. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Although the pathogenesis of the neurologic complications are not fully understood, the possible contributions of immune-related cytokine responses, less well-proven direct invasion of virus particles, and brain stem-related mechanisms for respiratory control have been recognized. 3, 5, [9] [10] [11] caused by factors other than RSV infections, and those with epilepsy were excluded. In this study, a simple febrile seizure was defined as a seizure occurring during a febrile illness and not caused by an acute disease of the nervous system in children aged between 6 months and 5 years. 18) The seizure should be generalized and short (duration less than 15 minutes) and not recur within 24 hours. Complex febrile seizure was defined as a 1) focal, 2) generalized, and prolonged seizure lasting more than 15 minutes and recurring with 24 hours, or 3) postictal neurological abnormalities, such as Todd's palsy. 18) This study was performed in a regional hospital in Guri, a city located in the metropolitan area around Seoul. All research protocols were ap proved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Hanyang University Guri Hospital (approval number: 2017-12-014). Informed consent was exempted by the IRB.
Demographic information and clinical courses of the patients; information regarding combined diseases; results of blood tests; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations; electroencephalography (EEG); and brain imaging techniques such as MRI (including DWI) were analyzed. Detection of RSV was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, with samples obtained by nasopharyngeal swabbing (AdvanSure, LG, Seoul, Korea).
Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic data. The continuous variables are presented as mean±standard deviation. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). The incidence reported by national RSV surveillance during the study period was used for comparison with the incidence pattern of this study.
We identified a total of 1,193 children who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during the study period; 35
The incidence of RSV-associated neurologic complications varies across studies and study populations. Sweetman et al. 7) reported the incidence of RSV-asso ciated neurologic complications to be 1.2%, which did not include cases with simple febrile seizure, and Ng et al. 12) reported the in cidence of RSV-associated encephalopathy to be 1.8%. In a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)-based study, Kho et al. 13) reviewed the cases of children between birth and 2 years of age with acute neuro logical symptoms and identified 39.1% of them as RSV-positive. In contrast, Millichap and Wainwright 5) reported that only 1% of the RSV-positive patients were admitted to the PICU with neurolo gic complications. In a study comparing the common viruses res ponsible for febrile seizure, Chung and Wong 14) revealed that the incidence of febrile seizure for RSV was 5.3%, and among them, complex febrile seizure was observed in 13.6% of cases, which was lower than the percentage of such cases for influenza and adenovirus.
In a previous study in Korea during November 2002 and June 2007, Yoon et al. 15) reported that the overall incidences of RSVassociated neurologic complications and seizures were 7.1% and 1.9%, respectively. Another study in Korea by Park et al. 16) reported that the incidence of RSV-associated encephalitis was 0.08%. The same study showed that RSV-associated brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings may resemble those of other viral and limbic encephali tis, and no abnormality on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was found. 16, 17) Although the study by Yoon et al. 15) was the first and the only study on the overall RSV-associated neurologic complications in Korea, further analysis of patients with seizure based on presumed causes was needed. In addition, most of the previous studies were regarding encephalopathy or relatively severe patients, and did not focus on overall features of RSV-associated seizures. It has not yet been fully determined whether the clinical characteristics of the RSV-associated febrile seizure are similar to those of the general febrile seizure, and whether RSV-associated afebrile seizures are benign situation-related seizures, as reported by Miyama and Goto. 6) Based on this background, we aimed to investigate the RSVassociated neurologic manifestations in children who presented with seizures. Furthermore, we report a transient DWI change in a young child with acute encephalopathy symptoms exhibiting seizures.
The medical records of the patients admitted to Hanyang University Guri Hospital from January 2011 to December 2016 were re viewed retrospectively. The inclusion criteria were as follows: children younger than 15 years, laboratory-confirmed RSV infection, and presentation of neurologic symptoms with seizures during the infection. The patients whose neurological symptoms were Table 1) . Most of them were younger than 36 months (32 of 35, 91.4%).The peak incidence month was November, and the seasonal distribution of incidence corresponded with the outbreak report of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fig. 1 ).
The most common neurologic manifestation was febrile seizure, identified in 27 patients (27 of 35, 77.1%); afebrile seizures without meningitis or encephalopathy were observed in 5 (5 of 35, 14.3%); seizures with meningitis were found in 2 (2 of 35, 5.7%); and seizures with ence phalopathy were reported in 1 (1 of 35, 2.9%). Eight of the 35 pati ents (22.9%) did not present with respiratory symptoms such as pneu monia or bronchiolitis. In 15 patients, coinfections were iden tified (15 of 35, 42.9%). The details of overall clinical characteristics are described in Table 1 .
For 21 patients (21 of 35, 60.0%), EEG signals were recorded, and six of them (6 of 21, 28.6%) showed abnormal focal discharges. (n=2). Details of the clinical profiles of febrile seizure are described in Table 2 . All the patients with febrile seizure recovered without complication.
Five patients showed afebrile seizures without meningitis or encephalopathy (boy, 4; girl, 1; mean age, 16.8±14.4 months). The types of seizure were as follows: generalized tonic-clonic (n=2), generalized tonic (n=1), hypomotor (n=1), and myoclonic (n=1). The patients had no family history of epilepsy and showed respiratory symptoms. Abnormal EEG signals were observed in 2 of the patients: focal epileptiform discharges from the parietal (n=1) and occipital (n=1) areas. Brain MRI abnormalities were observed in one of the patients: benign cavernous angioma. CSF examinations were performed in 4 patients, and all of them showed normal results. One of the patients who presented with epileptiform discharges from the parietal area during the first seizure later evolved to epile psy. Further details of the clinical profiles of afebrile seizures are described in Table 3 . Seizure with meningitis, confirmed by CSF examination, was observed in two patients (both girls; mean age, 4.0±4.2 months). One of the patients was a 7-month-old girl with urinary tract infection; she did not present with definite respiratory symptoms and showed abnormal EEG signals (continuous theta on left frontal electrode). In the patients with meningitis, CSF bacterial cultures and tests for enterovirus yielded negative results. Brain MRI results were normal in both patients. We did not perform the CSF examinations for the RSV. All the patients recovered without complication. Seizure with encephalopathy was observed in 1 patient. Detailed findings have been described below.
The patient was a 7-week-old female baby who visited our hospital due to respiratory difficulty, high fever (38.7ºC), and lethargy. Her 3-year-old elder brother had had a respiratory infection recently. Before admission, the patient was healthy and had no family history of seizure disorders. On the day of admission, she experienced three consecutive generalized tonic-clonic seizures with fever. Consciousness recovery between seizures was uncertain. After the admi nistra tion of intravenous lorazepam and phenobarbital, the sei zures stop ped. A polymerase chain reaction-based virus test using nasopharyn geal swab revealed RSV infection; CSF cytological tests, biochemical tests, and bacterial cultures yielded no abnormalities. Brain MRI with DWI performed at first hospital day revealed high signal intensity (HSI) at the internal capsule and splenium of corpus callosum on DWI and subtle low signals on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging at the same area. The HSI on DWI rapidly disappeared by the fourth hospital day, suggesting that the mechanism of encephalo pathy was transient cytotoxic edema (Fig. 2) . The EEG recordings showed sharp discharges from the frontotemporal area. The patient was admitted to the PICU, and gradually recovered over a week. In a follow-up visit at 12 months of age, neurological compli cation was not found and the abnormal discharges on EEG had disappeared.
In the present study, we reported overall RSV-associated sei zures in children. In summary, febrile seizure was the most com mon followed by afebrile seizure. Notably, the incidence of complex febrile seizure was higher, even more than that of simple febrile seizure. Although rare, RSV-associated meningitis and encephalopathy also accompanied seizures. Brain DWI of a patient with encephalopathy showed trans ient white matter change, which was presumed to be cytotoxic edema. The outcomes were mostly favorable, including that of the patient with encephalopathy, and one of the patients who presented with afebrile seizure evolved to epilepsy later.
An enveloped virus with negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, RSV belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. 9, 19) According to a recent systematic review, 33.1 million children aged less than 5 years are estimated to exhibit RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infections globally. Among them, 3.2 million are hospitalized and 59,600 cases result in in-hospital deaths. 1) Beside the common respiratory manifestations, extrapulmonary symptoms can be caused by RSV infection of the heart, liver, kidney, endocrine, and central nervous system. 3, 9) Although uncommon, central nervous system involvement is an important complication of RSV infection. The representative neurological manifestations are encephalopathy, seizures, and apnea. The rare complications are strabismus, acute axonal polyneuropathy, and diaphragmatic flutter. 4, 20, 21) However, most of the previous studies have focused on acute encephalopathy and PICU cases, and only a few have investigated the milder febrile seizure and afebrile seizures. 11, 12, 22) In the present study, we included overall seizures, which were reasonably presumed to be caused by RSV infection.
Febrile seizure may occur in any condition with acute elevation of body temperature in genetically predisposed children. The peak incidence age is approximately 18 months. 23) Most of the febrile seizures are generalized, with approximately one-third of the patients exhibiting complex febrile seizure and febrile status epilepticus occurring in 5% of the cases. 24) However, the RSV-related febrile seizure have not been well-characterized. The well-known study of Sweetman et al. 7) reported the incidence of neurological complication associated with RSV to be 1.2% (12 of 964 patients). The authors included 1 patient with complex febrile seizure but excluded five patients with simple febrile seizure. In the present study, the incidence of RSV-associated seizures, including febrile seizure, was 2.9%, which is higher than the finding of Sweetman et al. 7) The global features of febrile seizure observed in this study were similar to those of the generally known febrile seizure, such as age and benign nature. However, the incidence of com plex febrile seizure was higher than that of simple febrile seizure. Most of the patients showed multiple seizures in a day, which may be a distinguishing characteristic of RSV-associated febrile seizure. The reason of higher incidence of complex febrile seizure in RSVassociated febrile seizure is unclear. Previous studies reported the increased levels of CSF proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β in patients with encephalopathy who had RSV infection. Although febrile seizure is not as severe as encephalopathy is, RSV-specific cytokine responses may be related with multiple or prolonged RSV-associated febrile seizures. 11, 25, 26) As RSV is one of the common infections in young children, there should be further studies of the characteristics of febrile seizure in RSV infection.
The incidence of RSV-associated afebrile seizure in Japanese children has been reported to be 0.59% (6 of 1,019 patients), which is similar to the incidence reported in our study (0.42%, 5 of 1,193). 6) The authors suggested that the RSV-associated afebrile seizures were situation-related, and prognoses were quite favorable. 6) In our study population, the seizures were of various types, and in one of the cases, progressed to epilepsy. It is uncertain whether the RSV infection was merely incidental or might have influenced the occurrence of epilepsy. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of RSV in epilepsy.
Encephalopathy is a well-recognized RSV-associated complication, and its incidence has been reported to be 1.8%. 12) RSVasso ciated encephalopathies are often present with seizure. 12) Millichap and Wainwright 5) reported a greater severity of the neurological complications of RSV infection. They reported the cases of 9 patients, of which 4 (44%) were complicated by cardiac arrest, and 2 of the patients died. 5) Uda and Kitazawa 8) reported that the RSV-positive status epilepticus group required more ventilator care and antiepileptic drug treatment than did the RSV-negative status epilepticus group, and nearly one-third of them developed encephalopathy and profound neurological sequelae. In the present study, encephalopathy with seizure was rare and observed in only one patient. She recovered without complications, and DWI showed transient changes.
There are various RSV-associated neuroradiological findings. In most cases, brain MRI reveals no changes. However, the findings of brain edema on computed tomography and focal HSI on MRI (fluid attenuation inversion recovery and DWI) in CSF RSV-positive patients with seizures in another study suggest a pathogenic heterogeneity. 11) Furthermore, DWI abnormalities in the globus pallidus in the patient suggest ischemic changes. 5) In the study by Park et al., 16) the abnormal MRI findings for RSV-related encephalitis were rhombenmesencephalitis, limbic encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and diffusion abnormality on DWI was not found. In our encephalopathy case, the patient showed transient HSI on DWI on the first day of acute symptoms; this rapidly disappeared over 3 days. Our case suggests that cytotoxic edema is one of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying RSV-associated encephalopathy. Moreover, DWI can detect the early changes in encephalitis, and appropriate timing of MRI is important to reveal the dynamic changes. 27) In the very acute stage, restricted diffusion can be detected; in the subacute stage, diffusion restriction diminishes and the ADC value increases. 27) A good outcome is usually related with the absence of cytotoxic edema, because it implies cellular edema, which may result in cellular death. 27) However, the outcome of our patient was favorable; hence, cytotoxic edema of white matter in RSV-associated encephalopathy may not always be associated with poor outcome. Transient white matter cytotoxic edema is rare, and has been previously reported in a child with traumatic brain injury, whose DWI and ADC revealed restricted diffusion in the corpus callosum and peri-atrial white matter. 28, 29) The abundant N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors in the corpus callosum may lead to intracellular calcium entry. 28) Increased Ca 2+ activates enzymes such as ATPase, phospholipase, protease, and endonucleases can lead to the cell injury and death. 30) The limitation of this study lies in not including the nonseizure RSV-associated neurological complications and the inability to test RSV from CSF. Considering the high incidence and morbidity of RSV infection in young children, more studies are needed in the future.
We investigated the RSV-associated neurologic complications which are presented with seizures. It should be kept in mind that during an RSV epidemic, febrile seizure is more likely to repeat within 24 hours than is generally expected. Furthermore, DWI can detect early brain changes and reflect the pathophysiology of RSVassociated ence phalopathy.","Respiratory syncytial virus-associated seizures in Korean children, 2011–2016","Cha, Teahyen; Choi, Young Jin; Oh, Jae-Won; Kim, Chang-Ryul; Park, Dong Woo; Seol, In Joon; Moon, Jin-Hwa",Korean J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6477548/,253,2624,t8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
